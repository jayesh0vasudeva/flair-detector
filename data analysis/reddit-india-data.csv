Ask me anything!",simsim1000," Did you ever faced racism? 

And how is girlfriend scene there, got any? Foreigner or desi? And if foreigner, what your parents take on it?

Will you ever consider coming back to India? Say if India's GDP skyrockets or we become 5 trillion economy? How many tea stalls are there? Do you have mallu aagzent (accent) ? When was the last time you visited India? How different was it then you expected? Would you be open to marrying someone who grew up in India??  

Do you guys think people from India are mostly green card scammers.

This is a serious question as I'm curious about this topic and I don't mean to be edgy lol. What's your perception on Modi's recent lockdown in Kashmir( ie prolonged curfew, arresting political dissidents and cutting of all landlines , mobiles and internet (
-30 days and counting ) . Does it differ from your parents generation and  between the malyalee community vs ither states ? If you're single, how's the dating situation in New York? [deleted] Damn, I love Kerala food (Appam and stew ftw)! Where do you get your fix (apart from home obviously)? Mate, no one cares. Do you have anything substantial to add except for what you mentioned to interest or engage with a forum of over 1lakh people? What do we ask you about or why? Because you're a malyalee nri?

You can check the [video by The Wire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S6RJPJMKplE) where they ask many **actual** citizens (not days old) of Kashmir their perception. Perception of majority is that they want fee Kashmir, but what they always fail to answer is about what will they do after freedom and what will be policy and laws given that 3 nuclear countries live next to you.

Posting it here as Reddit in general, and this community in particular, have been a refuge over the last year as I shunned the rest of social media to prepare for civil services. It's great to know that so many level headed and witty people are out here, rising above the petty politics and crass humour that otherwise dominates our discourse.

Keep doing you, y'all.

Edit: Well they did tell me I will get some gold if I clear this exam /s :D

Thank you for the gold internet strangers and everyone else for the heartwarming wishes. Forever in your service, starting this August.

I want to start preparing right after my BSc in Physics.

When I clear Mains and get called for interview, will the panel mind that I am very young and don't have any job experience?
Can you please give me any input on that?

Edit: I have already began my preparation, in a manner. I am reading Indian Express everyday, started reading Indian history and economics (finished 9th standard). Do you think hard work + smart work is enough to crack UPSC? Isn't there a lot of luck involved considering only around 300 general students get selected out of around 10k+ seriously studying for it. Do you feel you got lucky in the first attempt? Wow. Happy for you. Congratulations!  Do an AMA if possible. Please marry me? Also, congratulations. Waiting for your AMA. r/Indian_Academia Ama please Congratulations op.

How your life have changed before starting the preparation and after finishing the prep? i mean, what is the effect of this exam on ones personality? Our civil administration does need some psedo liberals.
 Bahut Badhaiyan!
Will be waiting for AMA. *Matrimonial sites want to know your location* Congrats, OP. Hope you will serve the nation to the best of your ability. Congrats liberandu üèÜ People asking about how to clear upsc, use Quora, har jagah shuru hojate ho Congratulations! Please add basic info like optional subject, coaching centre etc. in the original post.  Hey so can u tell me if is it possible to compete UPSC through arts stream or do I have to take science? My parents say science makes it much easier. I don't know how but I guess u can shower some knowledge on it. DO REPLY PLEASE!!!!! Congrats bro, hope you will not convert into some  grumpy ""sir"" very soon. chalo, let's get married. I'm doing MBBS, so we can be the couple of every indian middle class household's dreams Congratulations and welcome to ‚Äòthe fellowship‚Äô üòÑ I just hope op remembers us when time cometh. congrats bro , hope to see your blog up at insights/forumias soon , all the best  Thanks I hate it. My parents have been telling me stories of kids who cleared UPSC all day.

Seriously though, congratulations brother. Hey... Remember this day whenever you feel depressed or demotivated somewhere along your work. Remember that you have the power to help the needy, do the right thing and stand up against people who do our society bad.

Congratulations. Congrats and most important question.  Do you have a girlfriend?  Congrats Buddy! Dont become one of those 'file sign' sahib. Try to take initiatives and most importantly lower rank officers are one who are corrupted state civil officers/tehsildar etc...so maybe try to bring honesty in department. All the best we need more young officers like you. Proud OP, the score in written part is in my control, I get based on how well I write. Now coming to the interview, how does the panel look at candidates who didn't give up, like let's say I have been at civils for 4 years after my graduation, doesn't that create a bad impression as in the candidate should have done something else rather than putting eggs in one basket?  Ay my man Mark Antony Congratulations  Congratulations! I never thought the day will ever come when an Indian redditor gets to go inside the heart of the national 'system'. Kudos to you.

On a different note (Not trying to be a party pooper or anything),  I feel it's my duty to bring the following up. 

Now the reality of the country's governance, working for the smug senior bureaucrats, swallowing one's pride and principles at the orders of our unethical, poorly literate and absolutely ruthless political masters should hit you after your training.

Don't let these things get you down. Stick to your principles. You will learn to 'adapt' to the system ( but don't do it too much!). At all times, please remember Gandhiji's Talisman. That should make your dilemma easier.

Much respect and well wishes from a concerned citizen. Legalize marijuana when you get there Congratulations!!!!!


Now, How much are you gonna charge to get job done?  

 Well apparently not all of us randians are useless it seems lol...Btw congratulations on your success, I too aspire to join the services someday Congratulations! You're now in a position to make a difference. Don't shun your values and don't become corrupted. Congratulations to you!! 

Overwhelmed to see a fellow redditor get into the Services, so freaking happy and inspired!! 

56 more days to 2019 Prelims and I really hope I get to post here the good news next year!  Another corrupt Government Employee.  Congratulations!!! Congratulations.

Have a great time, ahead :) Congratulations, please do an AMA. Congrats Mate.  Congratulations!!  Congratulations! Hope you will do great to this country. Congrats brother! Treat?

Please do an AMA!  Toh kya kren bc Congratulations! Try to be not corrupt!  Dude other services means?? I thought UPSC was for IAS only. Congrats on the exam clearance. But what really makes you exited to be a bureaucrat? You will literally be a cog in the wheel your whole life now. Are you that Kataria guy? Congrats buddy. I wish you the best of luck. Let's clean up and better our country together. üëä Congratulations!! Congratulation man!! Go and do good.... Acha bath hai Hey that's some positive news to hear today. Good luck with your tenure and be true to yourself and the country. God Bless your journey and your intentions... Congratulations.  You are the unrequited fulfilment of many of the India's citizens. Congrats stranger ! I will also write a post like this someday :) My cousin cleared the same and now my life will becomes hell, a whole lifetime of ‚Äúwhy you couldn‚Äôt be more like him‚Äù non sense its good for you though sure congratulations but it sucks for the rest of your cousins and siblings unless they‚Äôre all ias too Congratulations! Hope you have a successful career and you make a big impact wherever you go. There is lots to be done in the country and it is time for our generation to be the change was have always wanted. 

 Super Congratulations to you!

I want to prepare as well, but can't leave the current job for financial responsibilities. Will jot down a plan for doing so over a two year period, let's see how it turns out. Congrats mate! ""With great power, comes great responsibility"" You beauty! Congrats, my brother! I don't know why but I feel very happy and proud! :) Do an AMA please! Congratulations dude!! Now do the good work!  You cleared i  first attempt. That's great. Can you shed some light how to clear this exam. How to prepare ? How much hours you studied ?   Congrats. UPSC isn't my cup of tea. I'll be trying for ESE soon. Let's hope I am able to cope up with entirely different stream :V My dear brother, as much as I want to clear UPSE, I am afraid I am a bit weak in history and geography. I have a decent public sector job and I am trying to clear one of the major exams of 2019. Wish me luck as well. I will hit you up this time around next year with my results. Saving your post for future communication ease. You give me inspiration. 

Also, congratulations are well in order! Please do not get corrupted and do not waste your time like Dipak Rawat raiding small businessmen. I honestly think doing service to the poor should be the top priority. Hope you do us some justice and I hope you do not get pressured politically much. My best wishes are with you.  Congrats, but this isn't facebook. Indian parents want to know your location!! So you browsed reddit and cleared UPSC? KAISE?  Congratulations. Thank you for striving to make India a better place Wish you all the very best in your career.  ""Forever in your service, starting this August"" are seriously going to work for the people or for the ministers or just for the sake of perks you will enjoy rest of your life.

Source: Wikipedia
""In India's¬†parliamentary democracy, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration rests with the people's elected representatives‚Äîcabinet ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and it is for the civil servants, who serve at the pleasure of the¬†President of India, to carry it out.""

I never understood the concept of working for minister who don't have a degree but want a professional who had cracked objective questions in seconds, penned downed his thoughts flawlessly on holycow and ofcourse his interview rounds.

Would love hear the real reason behind to go for civil services of India.

I am sure the one who has so much knowledge with degree can lay polices also. Clear this dilemma please. Noice Congratulations man

I hope this one feat. Makes you leave a mark of honesty and integrity in india
I love my country but at the same time the petty politics and sheer corruption at every end makes me feel like an alien 
.i wish you propel to change whatever you can under your limits

All the best for your future

Also, do you have any bad habits, like smoking, drinking, girls, etc? Congrats, welcome to the services. Look me up if u r allotted maharashtra cadre. Congrats Man.  Happy Future of oppressing the poor and getting corrupted.  Congratulations üéä  Congrats bro!!! Good to know that u are from general category üëçüëç (read a comment below) Many many congratulations mate! Just 2 Questions -

* At what age did you start preparation for UPSC?

* Did you take *any* coaching?

I'm an aspirant myself. Congratulations! No offence , but are you sc/st or OBC ? As they have quotas , it's easy for them. it is extremely sad to see that indians in 2019 have dreams of working for the indian government and see it as the pinnacle of achievement.

It is very, very sad to see that the oppressive Raj has been replaced with indian rulers. That the population is blind to this is even more discouraging. The incentives of the Raj are almost exactly the same as that of the indian bureaucrat: exploitation and self-enrichment. They have not changed one bit. There are honest people in the bureaucracy but they are few and far between.

It should give us pause that we are celebrating someone joining the single largest organisation responsible for the loot of the nation on a daily basis: the government and bureaucracy. So, what is so appealing in civil services? I am sorry guys, if this sounds offensive to the post. But, I have not been in my country for about 9 years now. And had I known that I can also give civil services and end up in a good position in India, I would have definitely tried. Again, please don‚Äôt think I am undermining anything that the OP has done. And, another question is, can this exam be given by a person of any age? Like me, I am 31. Can I also give this exam and get into a good position in India? Thanks for listening patiently guys. Again, I repeat, no offense to the original poster. Peace! 

Comgrats to OP!!!! Sorry, my bad... Good, now lick Mudi kaka's arse üòÇ",2019-04-06 20:14:18
AMA,So this happened yesterday [R],609,bcz7em,https://imgur.com/DJXElBz,77,,High24x7," the fact that they are acknowledging the problem and giving you a refund instead of a 50 rupees coupon is surprisingly good So after chain snatching, food snatching is common now. Recently zomato delivery guy was also skeptical about giving me my order until I showed him the app and the order. He said people have been snatching orders recently. Which city is this? 

Happened to me once in Gurgaon. Two guys snatched a couple of pizzas from the delivery boy. He was very apologetic about it but I had to tell him not to worry. I don't expect him to fight with two burly guys over a fucking pizza. #justgurgaonthings :P Wtf? Is food order snatching a thing now? He's said it so calmly ,like this is a common thing that happens every now and then [removed] ""... delivery agent has *confirmed* that somebody snatched the order..""

He had to check twice to make sure they just wouldn't run around the block and give it back :D

It's pretty hilarious but I guess it's also worth noting that it's dangerous to be a food delivery person at 12:00am.

Edit: Fix Quote and typos This is hilarious ! The next time make sure to snatch the order yourself. :D FIR file kro. Cctv recordings check kro. We live in a society OP is ordering at 1230 am with 9% battery . Bad luck indeed ! Not sure if reddiquette is the appropriate tag here. Were you expecting to kickstart a conversation on prevalence of forcible dispossession of packaged sustenance from mobile vehicle-mounted agents in Indian urban spheres? Pretty sure this must be in NCR Lmao [removed] He took exactly 2 more minutes lol Happened with me on uber eats, turns out there was a strike among drivers so they were the ones who attacked ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è After reading the comments now I realized why Zomato delivery guys started asking me from which name the order was placed. It all makes sense now r/uselessgreencircle Which city? Pretty common occurrence where I live in Gurgaon.. :/ r/wellthatsucks Man..! I need to keep an eye on my lunch box. Wow that's crazy This is apparently very common. There are 'black zones' in every city where such things happen. Delivery guys get kidnapped into the house, their wallets and food stolen and they are beaten before they are let go. Not sure if police cases get filed in such cases.

AMA,AMA Request: A Kashmiri Pandit over 30 years old.,71,cnhzlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cnhzlf/ama_request_a_kashmiri_pandit_over_30_years_old/,74,"Now that 370 and 35A have been abolished, a few questions:

1. How do you perceive the Law and Order situation to evolve over the short term?

2. What are your expectations regarding returning to Kashmir?

3. Do you wish to return back to your ancestral house?

4. Would you be willing to pay back all the facilities that have been provided to you by the government for the past 30 years? For example, would you be willing to give up the housing that you got if you get your old house back?

5. Should reservation for Kashmiri Pandits be withdrawn now?",contraryview," I know one but he's 20. I'll try to contact his father. One of my closest school friends is KP, but I don't think he's on Reddit

His entire family is very happy about the decision of course My ex gf was, but eh, we don't talk any more. Got another opinion from a friend: 

""Answering as Kashmiri Pandit (KP) born in 1990, we lost our home, business, identity, culture, health and became refugee in our own country. No amount of  compensation can make KPs to go back because of one simple reason we lost trust in other community. My generation has heard and read horror stories of migration and how our kashmiri brothers watched while we were butchered. We don't know what future holds but exodus of my community will always be darkest chapter in the history of Kashmir. I dont know about others but I wont be able to ever go back. Its not to the point and emotions get in the way. Getting government assigned flats and houses is a good deal but it doesn't change the fact we lost our heritage and culture.""

Also he suggested you google Girja tickoo and Satish tickoo and read ""Our moon has blood clots"" I foresee the situation to worsen in Kashmir while it will get better in Jammu and Ladakh. This will predominantly be because of separatists and other locals who might have been rendered slightly powerless. There is a reason why PM sent more armed forces into the state.
As for my return, i can list out a few reasons why i do not want to return:
1. Highly volatile atmosphere with frequent disruptions due to militancy, army. 
2. Not many opportunities work wise
3. Presence of radical islamists and separatists in the valley makes me believe that it‚Äôs very easy for 1990 to repeat itself . There is a reason why extra army is present in Kashmir at the moment
4. sold off the only house we had in Srinagar for peanuts after finally giving up the idea of returning. Some of my cousins‚Äô houses were burnt down or squatters simply moved in. In short, there is no neighborhood I can think of returning to.
5. Younger cousins and the generation after has grown up outside of Kashmir with only language or food binding them to Kashmir. No point thrusting them into this chaos. 

Your question #4 does not make sense at all. How can you quantify someone‚Äôs loss that too after 30 years? Keep in mind, people did not only lose house or property, but whole lives were uprooted. The community has nearly lost its identity outside of JK and will essentially be non existent with in next 50 -100 years. Can you put a $ figure on it?

I am also not sure what reservations are you referring to in question #5. Kashmiri here, however, under 30.  
I will try to get someone to get your questions answered. I asked someone who is Kashmiri and above 30 years. Below is  his view :

""I  think everyone has his view point. One has to answer these questions today or tomorrow as these are the relevant questions. We still do not understand our position yet and what government of India has decided for us. Are we still migrants or that tag has been removed from us ? The situation says wait and watch."" Ama request. Rahul Pandita. KP was old enough to understand what was going on in 90s and Young enough to say us his opinions. RemindMe! 1 day Can we get anupam kher to do an ama? I'm 26 and from the Kashmiri Pandit community. Given my age, I agree that I'm not in the best position to answer OP's questions but I can take a stab if they're still interested. But below are some general thoughts if anyone's interested:

My parents were forced to leave Kashmir in 1989-90 and move to a place at the other end of the country where I grew up. They haven't been back since - just briefly for a week on vacation to show me what it's like about 15 years ago. And it's sad and terrible. But, it's possible to recognize the plight of Kashmiri Hindus that had their lives uprooted overnight 30 years ago while also recognizing that what's happening right now is upsetting, undemocratic and unconstitutional. 

Unfortunately, Indians (and the KP community to a large degree) has been consumed by bloodlust and it's fucking saddening. What's worse - and I find bewildering - is how none from the KP community were in support of repealing 370 until Modi showed up in 2014 and they realized this would be a way to unleash a fresh hell in Kashmir under the garb of ""patriotism"" and ""unification"" (perhaps I'm projecting too much malice on to their intentions when I should chalk it up to stupidity and propaganda). I don't think the community itself stands to gain a lot from this. 

The most honest analysis is that historically, a lot of parties - including those suffering the most today - fucked up but no one took ownership then and now it's just spiraled out of control after how oppressive the Indian government has been there. You expect States to be reasonable actors in these situations and not stoop to the level of terrorists because either way, it's the common person who's affected the most. And, as things stand today, while the Kashmiri Hindus have been rehabilitated elsewhere to a reasonable degree, more than two generations of Kashmiris who stayed in Kashmir (primarily Muslims and Sikh) grew up in the world's most militarized zone. I'm extremely pessimistic about the situation. I am quite certain that we're living through the creation of another West Bank here. I am a Kashmiri Pandit, I turn 30 in a few months. I know many Kashmir Pandits over 30, including my parents, grandparents, aunts, uncles.

1. I am of the opinion that Kashmir will be violent in the short term. Extremist violence is common in Kashmir, why should this situation be any different?
2. We will never return to Kashmir, outside of the occasional very short trip. I have been to Kashmir once in my life, despite my father begging me not to go, for my safety. I had to see the place that haunts my entire family, at least once. My father has been back once since the 1980s. The handful of elderly relatives that remained are slowly dying off. 
3. Our ancestral house was sold under duress while my family was in exile. Our neighbors are the onces who forced us to sell, under threat of violence. The bones still exist, but it was turned into a shopping mall. We won't return because we'll never feel safe. 
4. My family was not provided housing by the government of India. We were privileged enough to pay for our own housing. Many family members settled in the Delhi area and have done well for themselves since. Some family members  have moved to the US, Dubai, Singapore and elsewhere and have also done quite well for themselves. I know that my family is not the kind of Pandit you're asking the question about, but it is true that the Kashmiri diaspora has very little incentive to come back as they have rather good lives outside of Kashmir. Of course, those who are still refugees are different, but come on - Kashmri Pandits who have a modicum of success aren't moving back to a remote valley with poor infrastructure and a majority of inhabitants that could want us dead at any moment. 
5. Yes. The reservation was an ill-intentioned policy that failed Kashmiris and prevented the proper integration of Kashmir with India.

I am by no means a Hindu nationalist and I think the Indian government deserves plenty of blame for the situation in Kashmir as well as the plight of Kashmiri Pandits (as does the Pakistini government, and Kashmiri Muslims).

Frankly, I think Kashmiri Pandits are beside the point in this discussion, because Kashmiri Muslims succeeded in exterminating our culture. Without anchoring to the homeland, there aren't enough of us to carry it forward and those numbers continue to dwindle as we marry non-Kashmiris. In a generation or two, Kashmiri Pandits will cease to exist in any meaningful way and no policy will save that so policy making shouldn't consider ""our plight""

Policy making should have considered our plight 30 years ago, but now it's too late. Without internet and swarm of Bharat ke garam naujawan in reddit. I think I can see if no one turns up. In past perspective from Kashmiris were not well received by virath Bharat ke veer on this sub. [removed] [removed]",2019-08-08 20:23:43

AMA,I am an Indian getting married to a Pakistani girl later this summer. AMA!,265,c0hmag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c0hmag/i_am_an_indian_getting_married_to_a_pakistani/,255,"As controversial as it seems, this journey has been extremely difficult for both of us. Amidst recent tensions between both the countries and general temperament of the people, it was a challenge to get people to agree to this arrangement. The only thing that made it easier is the fact that we are both muslim. I am a proud Indian and love my country, however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues. It has been highly stressful psychologically as well.

I wanted to share this experience that I endured for a year and the troubles we both faced in the light of modern politics and peoples mindsets. To give you some background: I am from Bangalore, born and bought up and she is from Lahore, we both met in London at uni where we fell In love and decided to get married. Go ahead, ask me anything!",muaazkhn," So, reverse Sania Mirza!

Congrats! Which side has better Biryani? Also congratulations op! Who will your kids support during Ind vs Pak?
**Congratulations anyway** I just want to congratulate you! Wish you a very happy married life!! Name you're kid Kashmir. Do play Lahore by Guru Randhawa on your wedding if you can. It would be fun. [deleted] Wow, British are finally making amends! Congrats op! How hot are her friends man? Please seek blessings from Mudikaka. What were your parents reaction when you told the about the marriage? 
Also, what religion will you be teaching your children if at all you want to. Unless you plan to stay internationally you're bound to face huge problems in bringing her to India and her going back to Pakistan for visits etc.given the tense situation which can blow up anytime into a war like one.

How'd you plan to handle it? Congratulations! Punjaban, good luck man. What did her parents and relatives have to say about the arrangement? Congratulations man! God bless you both! Dating a Pakistani was fun when I was in London, but I wouldn‚Äôt have had the balls to marry one. Kudos!

Just remember one thing, even if you guys end up getting British citizenship, Indian govt for the purpose of immigration when you enter the country won‚Äôt allow her a visa on arrival that other Brit citizens are eligible for since she would be an ex-Pakistani citizen. 

However, that is atleast about 7 years away, so meanwhile she would be getting these short term visas. And by short term I‚Äôm talking in days and not months. Max my Pakistani friend who got married to an Indian from WB has gotten is 45 days. He is a  green card holder, she has American passport with PIO. 

Don‚Äôt let these small irritants deter you from celebrating the glory of your marriage. 

God bless you two again! Congrats!

Out of curiosity

&#x200B;

\>however, this marriage arrangement is being faced with alot of criticism from friends, families and colleagues

&#x200B;

is this due to political differences between india/pak ie nationalism (If so more from pakistan side or indian side)? Or are there significant cultural differences causing this?

Also when you go to Lahore make sure you know the location of all handpumps  :P When you are getting married don't bring a cat/kitten in a basket :p I wonder what would've happened if you belonged to some other religion. Hey, congrats man!

Since the time you met her, how have your perceptions about Pakistan or her about India changed? Please send pics of food. Thanks. Congratulations. Do you think more relationships like this may ease the tension between the two countries? I read that you're planning to settle in London and register the marriage there. Did you get married in India and then request to get the marriage registered in London?

Also are you from London and will be sponsoring her as a dependent? Omg this is so cute man, who made the first move? Ok.. What are the real problem that you faced?

He said this to me ""aadha amrican aur adha indian to thah, phir bewi ney lar kar aur adha indian kar diya. this is one of the most wholesome threads ever. I had a friend in Melbourne, Punjabi Sikh who had married a Pakistani Muslim girl who was Australian born and brought up. Neither of the families raised any issue since they were not residing in India. Can't imagine how that would've turned had they been  residents back home. Congrats man. Though apparently its not unheard of for Indian origin and Pakistani origin people to marry in UK, especially among muslims. It's all one big desi community once you leave your home country. Once you settle in there, no one will bother you. Have fun. Weird flex, but ok^/s Congratulations sir :)

Just curious, if you have discussed this, was there any difference in how India/Pak's historical events were perceived by her and by you. Might be interesting to know how much of the information passed on to us in our/their history books/media is correct or not. Congratulations.
Have you visited Pakistan to visit her fam? Or did your girl's family visit you and your fam in India? 
Where do you plan to get married? I already see too many visa problems either way. 
All the best for your life, Pakistani women are very beautiful :) Tennis wali sania Dulha khojal Pakistani Invite me to your marriage pleassseeeee. I LOVE BIRYANI and would enjoy the culture as well. For me its a bit more complicated. I am a brahmin, but we are ready for the challenges lying ahead!! all the best to you. Was religion a big factor? I'm assuming you follow Islam because of your username. If so, did it help in any way? Are you planning to stay in London or will you move to India/Pakistan?

AMA,India's first indigenous processor developed at IIT Bombay. I am a designer AMA!!,4390,bfrh0g,https://i.redd.it/37dmt3wfnnt21.jpg,622,,prabot," Well done OP, but honestly you should have shared more details.

> [Welcome AJIT, a ‚ÄòMade in India‚Äô Microprocessor](
https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-‚Äòmade-india‚Äô-microprocessor) 

> Prof. Madhav Desai and his team of about nine researchers from IIT Bombay have designed and developed the processor entirely at the institute. The project was funded by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY)  and IIT Bombay. Powai Labs, a Mumbai-based company, has also invested in the venture and will own, market and support the product. 

> AJIT‚Äôs features can be compared to many of the microprocessors of its size available in today‚Äôs market. Unlike the ones used in the desktops like the Intel‚Äôs Xeon, AJIT is a medium-sized processor. It can be used inside a set-top box, as a control panel for automation systems, in a traffic light controller or even robotic systems. What‚Äôs more, the researchers expect that AJIT will cost as less as ‚Çπ100 when it is produced en-masse. 

> AJIT can run one instruction per clock cycle and can operate at clock speeds between 70-120MHz, comparable to its competitors in the market.

> ‚ÄúWe have been working on this processor design for more than two years now. The design has been tested on programmable semiconductor chips before we began our effort towards fabricating the processor,‚Äù says Prof. Desai

> The researchers have made the software tools associated with AJIT freely available to everyone. The processor is also available as a ‚Äòsoftcore‚Äô, where vendors can buy a license to use the design of the microprocessor and fabricate it to use it in their system. The researchers also offer to customise the processor for specific applications.


There is a lot more info in the article. ELI5 how it is different from other processors and where IITB is planning to use it? Any RISC while using this? Can it run Crysis???? Whats next? How you are going forward with this ? a. How is this different from SHAKTHI?

b. In What kind of hardware these chips might end up in? Laptops may be....?

c. Any plans for mass producing? Have a few questions for you..

1. Which module(s) were you part of?

2. Which HDL was the processor coded in?

3. What was the technology node this was done in? And what was the method of building standard cell library?

4. Which language/methodology was used for verification?

5. What was your preferred method for DFT?

6. Can you disclose the layout, package analysis and SI tools?

7. Which aspect of the processor, according to you, was most challenging?

8. Is this our own fab? I'm dying to know we can have cutting edge fab tech in India. Been watching out for this for about 2 decades now.

Thanks for this ama, and keep doing the good work! Congratulations! Are there going to be further iterations, or is this the final product? And are you going to dive into mass production straightaway? what are the commercial applications or is it just a milestep to develop something even more complex Can it run Chrome with five open tabs? I'm a non IT guy (Accounts). Can someone explain the significance of this? Wasn't the 1st microprocessor developed by IIT Madras? Shakti.  How is it different from it & can it compete with Intel? Can we build a low cost Raspberry Pi/Arduino alternative with this chip? Or what kind of hardware specs are yet to be integrated in this for one to realise a functioning SBC for the DIY maker community. Thanks for doing this AMA! I'm really interested in the field of architecture.
Does this processor implement pipelining? Does it dispatch instructions in order or does it implement out of order dispatch/processing? Why not RISC? What is the design team size at IITB? I assume the final synthesis, verification, and layout was done in Cadence? How many design cycles did you need before taping out the final version? Sorry for too many questions! Once the final version is out into mass production, can we have a course like *NAND to Tetris*, where they try to teach us how an entire computer is built out of nand gate. 

Something like this for electronics(in this case the design) which will ease the fear and improve the understanding, of course this should come out in free time How much did it cost to develop this processor? Is this the same as developed in IIT Madras?? Which was fabricated for free at Oregon? Wow. This is amazing!!

I'm guessing this is based on open source hardware. Is the architecture of this cpu available to take a look at? Congratulations! Can you give a bit of a overview of what it is capable of? What kind of skills would i need to become a part of something like this? I'm currently doing my undergrad in ECE. Which subjects should i focus more on to develop the skills you have to make a chip like this? Hey,

While I really commend the AJIT work from IIT Bombay, I feel there are quite a few mis-conceptions in the AMA which need to be addressed. This is in no way critical of AJIT, just that people should be more aware of the information they consume.

>IIT Madras partnered with Bluespec to work in collaboration with them for a major part. Here we have implemented everything from scratch.

Untrue. IIT Madras used the Bluespec language. It's like saying if I used Rust, I worked in collaboration with Mozilla. Now the counter-point given here by OP of AMA is that it is an American company and Ajit is developed in India, so all good. Now let me tell you, developing a language and compiler is hard. That is why Bluespec started at MIT, has one of the few companies that has got it right and with around 10 years of experience in this field, their product is really good for processor dev. Also, Bluespec has DARPA funded programs, which increases the confidence in their language.

Bluespec is happy to give free licenses to educational institutions! Do check them out. Finally, the code we write in Bluespec is owned by the writers, no **partnering with Bluespec**.

>Yes, it is a pipelined processor and thus in-order.

Mate, don't expect to make statements like these if you designed a processor by yourself. Your statement implies, a pipelined processor is always in-order. So are Intel/Amd chips not pipelined, as they are out-of-order. I'll give you the benefit of doubt that you mis-typed that, hope you get across.

>RISC-V is not considered a stable architecture by many people around the world and is not a proven architecture whereas Sparc is an old but proven architecture and hence was a better choice.

I don't know where you get this from mate. Did you know the Pixel 3 from Google has a RISC-V core in it? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7aAUlHoV2E&t=55s)

Or that NVIDIA is going to use RISC-V in their GPU's? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gg1lISJfJI0&t=645s)

Or that Western Digital has already committed to replacing all their chips with RISC-V cores, and they have open source cores out there? [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlIhU_vovP0)

The only notable company I knew anything about developing Sparc processors was Fujitsu, for supercomputers. Even they moved to ARM -

>We first caught wind of the Post-K supercomputer back in June 2016, when Fujitsu unveiled some of the architectural features of the future machine and confirmed its switch from Sparc64-fx motors to a custom Arm chip.

[Link](https://www.nextplatform.com/2018/08/24/fujitsus-a64fx-arm-chip-waves-the-hpc-banner-high/)

>Shakti was built using proprietary software and this has been built from scratch so technically this is the first one. Yes, it is an SoC. I can't reveal that information here because of NDAs. The compiler already exists for Sparc-v8 and has been provided by GNU org.

So then don't call it India's first indigenous processor. Call it India's first indigenous processor-design language and not India's **first indigenous processor.** Because Shakti with the open-source code-base - [Link](https://bitbucket.org/casl/c-class), an ACM publication - [Paper](https://acc.digital/shakti-an-open-source-processor-ecosystem/) can safely claim to have been designed before you.

Anyways, it doesn't matter if Shakti was even the 10th fucking processor in line after miles, it would just be better if [u/prabot](https://www.reddit.com/u/prabot) stopped making misinformed comments. If you call yourself an academician working at a prestigious place like IITB, you should put a bit more thought into your responses. Are you planning to do MBA from IIMA as well. What's the cost compared to an Intel/AMD processor? And clock speed? What was the most challenging part? Are you from electronics or CSE? As a cse student from another iit this sounds a great development and shows the amount of hard work you guys put in research. Congratulations!  
 
PS : hire me in next placement season What is the purpose of creating this processor? Do you see India as a competent nation Atleast in terms of necessary resources for setting international industrial standards for this chip in near future(10-15 years)?

Summing up,can we use these chips like the pic/Arm/Avr in anytime in future or is it too early to call a shot? Congrats! Any plans for a retail development board? What is the full form of AJIT? Will you employ americans to do your telephone support? What were your biggest challenges ? When was this accomplished? [Link to the detailed article](https://researchmatters.in/news/welcome-ajit-%E2%80%98made-india%E2%80%99-microprocessor)

P.S : Thanks to u/kash_if Congrats!

Are you going to release it publically? Like for use in phones and computers? Or is it going to be reserved for research purposes?

Also how is it better than currently used processors? i seem to be more interested in how did you get involved. i have similar ambitions. could you, please? How good is fabrication from SCL? Are you going to open source the instruction set, bootloader code, etc? Where can I download the RTL, is it there on opencores? Business Perspective: Will India be into processor fabrication, like how it is into IT services. Do we have required raw materials and the process to fabricate with cost lesser than importing one. I have a more general question. China is investing a lot in semiconductors in order to reduce chip imports. It also has companies like HiSilicon which is aiming for competing with the likes of Qualcomm. India is obviously not quite there yet but there have been voices calling for this for years.

How realistic should we be with our expectations? When could we see an Indian competitors to these kinds of companies? Do you think the state needs to step in the way it has in China with massive financial support or do you think the private sector can do it on its own with some collaboration with academia? Thanks. - Is the tech used on par with what other international makers are using? Where do we fall behind? 

- Why would a device maker use this processor instead of commercially available similar processors?

- How far is it from mass production? Will it even be mass produced or just remain a lab experiment?

- Why do you think are we so far behind in this space? Almost all developed countries have dozens of fab plants and India has just one? Why is govt. not investing in this industry, this industry alone could give a massive boost to the Indian economy? What instruction set? [deleted] 1)Does it require its own motherboard or is it compatible with commercial available mobo.                    
   2) How will you compare it with current gen CPU of Intel and AMD,like which processor will it be comparable to.             
               3)How much RAM it supoort How far is it from mass production? When could we see any company or you announcing real world products? I don't really have a question - just wanted to congratulate you and the entire team - hope this endeavor continues to even greater heights. Well done! Where is the technical documentation? Is this going to be an open core? That is so fucking cool. Kitna deti hai? I don‚Äôt know much about processors or about tech in India but it looks cool and you have my upvote We were told you were making this, in VJTI. One time Prof. Girish Kumar mentioned this too. Congratulations on its completion. üíú Now we‚Äôll have to call America for support Respect bro A wonderful achievement itself , I hope that we can see India producing microprocessors with the likes of Intel or AMD's flagship microprocessors at a cheap rate and paving the new generation of microprocessors for the betterment of technology and the country soon enough. Congrats, you've made us proud! Btech or Mtech Honest question: why have you started this AMA on a Sunday past midnight? fabrication ? 
10 nm ? x86, ARM or something new? Can it run Crysis? [deleted] Which Architecture dose it support and what is max data carrying and crunching capacity of this processor ? Where and by whom did you get the fabrication done?

Do you think we can get mobile phone manufacturers to set up high volume fabrication (not assembly, which are already in few places or will be) plants in India? 
Congratulations quite happy to see development of a processor in India 
Can you list the issues facing the semi conductor development and  fabrication sector in our country? like we do not have a single fab company That manufacturers of devices could use What is the distance between its transistors? How did you get into the process of creating it? How does it differ from other processors in terms of performance and efficiency? I am assuming there must be some caveats as this is a new project so can you please mention them. Specs details? Are you looking to make it an industry standard, if yes, what advantage does it have over intel or similar popular processors First of all many many congratulations..!! 
So what are the future plans? Only use it for the systems and applications you mentioned above? Or near future you have any commercialization plans for this processor to be used in PC's? How can i be involed in any manner in any kind of process within this project? . Damn keen on knowing/understanding this development. [deleted] Wasn't Shakti the first one?
How similar are the two?
Major applications? Could you please share what processor node this was based on? Is it market ready or still a kind of prototype? If it is market ready, what are the next plans for use of this mp? But the real question is, can you game with it? RISC based ? How is it compared to the currently available same type of processors? Thanks for the ama!
Some questions I have-

1. What tools did you use for apr? And does Iit bombay have good license support?

2. You mentioned you‚Äôre moving to 65, which fab would this be made by?

3. Does Scl supply any memory compilers?

4. How much of the chip was made in custom?

5. Why did you use vhdl instead of system verilog? Why have you named it Ajit man ? We already got a ""Ajit Pai"" meme, the dude who tried to destroy internet, now soon we will have Ajit processor meme's, why on Earth would you name a processor Ajit ? Why not something like Arjun, Drona, Bhishma, Ram, Shiv, Karna, Karma, Duryodhan, Ravan, Hanuman, Bajrang, Vayu, Trimorti, Bheem or anything else ? So this is different from the ‚ÄúShakti‚Äù processor from IIT Madras? This looks really cool. What desktop processor does it compare to in terms of performance ? I have answered a lot of questions in a short while. I think I will come back after a bit. Please keep the questions coming I am really excited about upcoming questions. Where do plan to get it fabricated at 65nm? Is SCL starting fabrication at 65nm? Is Mass production of this going to happen in India or abroad? I read you said it'll be mass produced at an aim of 100rs but will that be possible to be done within in India? Does India have a leap-frog advantage of starting late in this field? Like the lack of credit cards was okay since we leap frogged to finance apps for credit Don't know much about processors but that looks gorgeous This is exicitng. 
Nano meter? Also do you think we'll be able to mass produce? If AJIT was comparable in performance and speed to a commercially available processor that was made in the past, which one would you equate it to? Any reason behind the name AJIT ?  
Also, congrats and good luck What incentive do businesses have to design their products using this processor? Does it require external cooling? Or is the IHS enough to cool this processor? What kind of power consumption can it handle? Also does What kind of TDP applies to it. You've made so proud and happy OP we need more of you. How complicated is the manufacturing for this processor? Process node? Are there any public papers on how their transistor performance compares to competitors ? What are some pros and cons from x86 and Arm Congratulations :D How commercially viable is this processor. When ARM, Intel and AMD are flooded the market. Do you have any plans to sell Dev kits like raspberry pi? What exactly has been built from ground up? Is it the ISA? Is is the underlying VLSI? Is the actual fab done in India? Can it make me a sandwich? What next? It's 2019 ffs. Congratulations OP. You guys have accomplished a enormous task. I am proud of you people. Some questions if you don't mind.

1-Are guys planning to release an SoC of this.?
2-Is there 64 bit or further in the future?
3-How many no of transistors does it have?
4-Is it able to run the Linux Kernel?
5-What was the most challenging part in the design of the AJIT? Why didn‚Äôt we make it any time sooner? What were the challenges that stopped us from making this processor in earlier decades?
There are some really famous and efficient processors readily available in the market at affordable price. Are you planning to get this project to that level or is it only for research purposes. Compare it with something like ARM7 / ARM M4 ? I‚Äôve installed a chip like that by hand. Hand formed, hand soldered. This is a remarkable feat but this causes a brief flashback. Aside from the awesome technical accomplishment,  I must also acknowledge the pleasing aesthetic of your product.

Congratulations! Hey great work indeed. How big are the dimensions of current processor? I‚Äôll buy a development board if there ever is one available! Does it have a built in serial UART? Where did you copy-pasted the design? You just made my point Could you tell us the specifications? Transistor size, density, etc. What level of clean room is available to you? 100? Techniques used for lithography and masks.

I'm also intrigued by the code to hardware thing. I'd guess specialized hardware runs orders of magnitude faster as opposed to generalized ones. 

Would it be possible to make a chip for a particular time consuming program(say photo shop or matlab) making it much cheaper hardware wise if you wish to use it for a singular purpose. Making it sort of cartridges like which used to be case with nes video games making it impossible to pirate a software.

Also most of the specialized machines (SEM, TEM) we have run on way old computer software e.g. 95 and 98 as they don't invest in drivers for newer version of windows. Would it be possible to replace the controller of these machines with a single use computer.

Also is anyone working on quantum computing? People are trying to build it up from scratch so wouldn't it be better if we could jump on it. More like mobile revolution happened in India skipping the landline revolution. OP can you suggest me some resources on 8086. IWTL I have a genuine doubt about something being called 'indigenous'. What does it really mean? hope this captures diy market and helps developing prototype projects quickly Congratulations on your success. Even though i dont know anything about computers. But this looks interesting. Well done! Could this guy run Linux? What sort of I/O does it provide? (Ethernet, GPIO, I2C, etc) where is it manufactured?? Btw great job.  What‚Äôs with the name? Any chances for a cooler name that appeals to the millennials? Why the naming? It sucks so bad.. get a ambitious name atleast. First of all congratulations! Its great achievement.

Does it have its own Instruction set? Is it RISC or CISC? How come only a few newspapers and reddit will celebrate these achievements which come out of IITs and IISc ? This is awesome. Congrats. But, since you mentioned the ‚Äúfuture,‚Äù I am wondering if you and your team are ready to bypass all patents for chip manufacturing. Eg. developed patentable creative way of developing it without interfering prior arts. 

I wonder why military can‚Äôt use foreign chipsets; maybe reverse engineering to make sure it does what it does would be sufficient enough and cost effective. How many masks were needed to fabricate this? How long will it take to launch it to market
And what more improvements are we looking at? can you please state the specs Is there a reference manual and a compiler?

What are the advantages of developing own microprocessor compared to picking up an ARM reference architecture and customizing it for your own requirements? How much cooling does it require? Is it passively cooled? Asking since the clock speed isn't something in Ghz.

&#x200B;

What kind of motherboard or accessories does it require to work? What about things such as RAM and other hardware controllers like storage or other things? (sorry if question isn't clear I'm not much of a Chip guy lol.) any chance of a micro controller/processor like arduino/rspbpi? with peripherals? Congrats! How long did the whole project take to reach up to this prototype? What's the power consumption of this prototype?

How do you come up with the Rs 100 estimate of mass produced cost?

What's the minimum feature size/technology node of the fab process for Ajit?

Do the power consumption and performance meet the envisioned use case for satellite deployment? Hiya OP, I'm glad you guys have done this, it's quite something, do you plan on building anything in the future for desktop grade architecture? Cheers! what is the ISA for this processor? are there any benchmarks? what architecture was used to produce this RISC or CISC..?? Yay Considering the many processors that are currently in the market, could you please tell us how this compares or rather how this is better? Could you also lay the difference in cost when comparing with other processors in the same category?

Now that this was fabricated in India where do you see the future of of microprocessor fabrication in our country?

EDIT: how would this compare to an ARM, raspberrypi and so on? Can we expect this to be commercially available for home projects? Can it run minesweeper What will be the benchmark processor if we wish to compare with other popular ones. ? Will this be commercialized, and actually be able to compete with processors by other big companies? Cost less than rs100 if produced on a mass scale? How much does a processor of same specs cost in the market? What is the assumed profit margin to your product? Does it work? What educational background do I need to join your team? Reading through all the comments and sub-comments, I can't help but wonder that this AMA is a supreme example of how an AMA should be. [deleted] Hi there,

I have a couple of questions (3 infact)

1. Why do we not have our own indigenous processors that compete with the likes of Giants like Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, Exynos or Kirin? I mean its been so long, we have some greatest brains in our country.
2. Not offending anyone, but we could have probably reverse engineered the process or taken help from engineers who have previously worked for these companies. Why do we have to start from scratch? Why start from Mhz? Why not directly Ghz? (atleast 1 Ghz would be good. Enthusiasts would probably buy this instead of the Raspberry Pi and provide some funding to the research)
3. At this rate, how long do you think will it take to reach a competitive level in terms of the ""nm"" tech.? (Please don't say near future) Which programmable chip (I am assuming some FPGA) did you use for testing AJIT? I will try a HPC around it. Xilinx devkits are really good at combining softcores and provide an on-board ARM processor to build a complete embedded system where you can accelerate hardware and use ARM's existing computational capabilities. 1. How long did it take to complete the entire ASIC flow? 
2. Is there a spec sheet available? Im all in for indigenous technology..But don't you think we are bit too late in the processor making race. Even mobile processors have achieved GHz capacity with half a dozen parallel cores with integrated peripherals. Even if we catch up with the big players in the market, we will still need to build the ecosystem around it, do you think we can do that ? 

I agree this is just a start, we can use low frequency processors in a lot of military, industrial and household equipments - microwaves, washing machines, are you guys looking at a niche within that or is it going to be some heavy computing in future?

And, i kinda feel that government wants to make headlines with this, every government in india does that, how is their support in the long term ? 

Also, this is a very huge opportunity, it feels great to be a part of something this big. How is the diversity in the public institutions that support this kind of leg room in technological research ? Kudos Brother / Sister. :) Hearty congratulations on your Achievements

Brutal Question
Do you plan to implement a secret CPU running inside the processor which has complete remote access, similar to Intel's **Management Engine** or AMD's **TrustZone**?

If not how would you takle pressure from government authorities in case it is mandated. Benchmarks pls Reading AJIT on that chip triggers me because of AJIT PAI. 

Nonetheless, Kudos for this achievement OP and his team. Can it run crysis? Hi, I am so interested in designing microchips and processors. Being part of a team that develops such products is so awesome! I am currently on my way to enter Mtech VLSI in one of the NITs. Can you suggest some essential tools/skills that'll help me to get into such industry? I am from electronics background and circuits have always fascinated me. Wrong, IIT Madras developed 'SHAKTI' processor in Nov 2018 Looks like arc reactor from Ironman 2 (it's square instead of triangle). One question though, how is it different from other processors in the market (despite it would be produced in India) and are we planning to mass produce it here? And congratulations, this marks a success!! I initially thought, it was a carom board. Well done! When will it be mass produced? So you started from wafer level? How did you get all the etching done? That's a very nice and insanely costly thing to have to just make one chip, isn't it? Any plans to build GPUs? u/prabot kudos on the success. I had a query. What is the socket/pin description for AJIT? Wasn't Shakti the first one???
Please correct me if I'm wrong. How many nanometers? Can it compete with STM 32? What architecture is it? Is it a new one? Comparable with STM 32? Architecture? Btw wasn't riscv based shakti released before your processor? All I see is that you're going for the embedded market, but every story I read describes the AJIT as a microprocessor. Are you planning on making a microcontroller with this architecture or is it meant to be a processor only?

I mean a 32bit 100MHz uC for approx 2usd would be sweet, although I don't, from a marketability standpoint, understand why you went with the sparc v8. I guess licensing ARM would render the chip too expensive.

I'm going to stick with AVR and ARM for now, but I wish you good luck with the AJIT. Does it do the needful? PAPA ne nahin bola sharma ji ka beta is in Intel making 10nm processors /s Show bobs and vagna RISC V ARCH I Guess ? what does it run?, what architecture is this? , what's the benchmark? 
any link to such details would be appreciated.

Nice work though. Will there be any requirement of operating system / kernel developer ? 
What will be Applications ? I'm really intersted in learning this stuff (designing processors / how processors work) do you have any book recommendations? But can it run Crisis? Do you hope to rival other processor manufacturers such as intel and AMD in their processing power? Or aiming to excel above their standards? Would you say that the price would be similar or cheaper? And final question, would you also manufacture a cooling system that best suits this new processor that is both light weight and highly efficient? If so you got my complete support! Is nanotechnology a buzzword or will it make an impact? Thank you for sharing this!  Just curious why choose C and not C++ Oh wow to my gaming mind that looked similar to  pc processor lol, but im still amazed and hopefully this will be the technological boost needed to push india into the forefront of technological development can it be used as raspberry pi for learning. if yes will it be commercially available at a cheaper price than pi? Can I play Skyrim with it? I Salute you anyway. Where do you see India in the next 10 years in this particular field ? Are there any mega plans or vision policy that the government has regarding this? How are we doing on the theoretical front of it ,as in what is the original research output that we are generating ? How does it compare to Intel and AMD cpus? What's your JEE score /s Following the Moore's always we will be reaching the current configurations of CPU's around 20 years from now OP ? Or shorter. But still this is amazing, I have seen the productions lines, and it seems hella crazy, so much precision, care and methods. Great Work !! Can it run Crysis? How is this different (or better) than other silicon based processors from silicon valley? I'm curious @prabot do you work at powai labs ? Will it still follow Moore's law ? :) Congratulations from IIT Kharagpur. Even though this is much slower than Industry standard processors around the world.  
I'm still proud of this achievement done in India. Hopefully our government will start funding more towards this. I'm not a technical guy, but, is there a possibility that the project can, sometime in future, be scaled up into a motherboard that can go into laptops made in India for Indian market? I'm sick of people always bragging about how electronics are cheaper overseas and the lengths to which people go to save $100 on their laptops by asking their overseas cousins to get mobiles and laptops for them. I'd really like to see laptops and other electronics developed in India and being cost-competitive with the rest of the world. All of the following question are on ELI5 level :

1.) Can you do a comparison of your processor and i3/i5 .

2.) Can processors be reverse engineered? how hard is to reverse engineer a processor.

3.) Who are the giants in the field of processors research/R&D.

4.) What are the key obstacles in the development of processors.

5.) What kind of equipments are needed to manufacture your product? are these machineries available/produced in india? what machineries are required to mass produce your product. Also, what's the cost of manufacturing your product (say 10,000 processor)

6.) why it took so many years for india to produce a processor while companies like intel is selling it to millions?

7.) I see in every few month a more developed processor is launched (i3 ----> i5 ----> i7)  why is that they couldn't able to produce the current version few months ago? how come they weren't able to produce it then but just after 6 months they can produce it now.

8.) What's the highest potential of current processor technology? 

9.) I have heard about quantum processors, are they the next generation of processors? how different is the quantum processor technology to the current processor technology?

10.) If you had a superconductor, what effect would you have on your processor/ or in the world of processor? What programming language did you the most? ARM? He's answered only 2 questions by my count and they were pretty softball ones. Pack it up boys. This is starting to look like the Arnoob Goswami AMA. Propaganda at its finest. I wonder if this processor even exists or if it's just another fabrication of the government propaganda? Heard that it is based on havard architecture instead of von Neumann. Why is that? [removed] I thought SHAKTI was India‚Äôs first microprocessor. Does it run `gcc`? Could you tell me why some of the brats from IIT are so arrogant? Bet it works as well as testicles in a pc Wow! Salute to the guy who made India proud! Does it have a toilet ? Kitna deti hai?? Why does India make it so hard to do business with other countries? Non tech guy here. Is this chip a mobile processor? I hope and believe if Indians would finally stop leaking their top talent to other countries and find a way to implore them to staying there. I feel extremely bad how all the incredible talent that our nation generates leaves and ends up fighting to find a way to find citizenship in an another country as opposed to leading our own to greatness. 

I am one of them and I feel ashamed of that fact every day.

Hopefully one day I can return and pride myself for being Indian.. 

#JAIHIND Can it run Crysis? Why would I want to use yours over lets say a core i9 or ryzen 7? Do you plan on competing with them in the kind of tasks they do? i.e. mainstream processing",2019-04-22 07:17:50

*This is just an announcement. The AMA thread will be posted by the guest at 2 PM tomorrow.*


",kash_if," This is huge. Well done! Good one Mods! 
Please someone ask her what her plans for entire India would be like in education, as I may not be online around that time.  Very cool and epic Would there be a chance to ask our questions prior to the start? Time constraints here make it hard to be online at that time. okay that's nice. Do kejriwal next please noice! well done mods Great job mods. Here are two of my questions in case I don't make it online then:

1. A recent survey showed that 65% of government schools in Delhi are without principals. While the government says the matter is with the LG, how do we make sure children and their studies are not impacted?

2. Delhi is a city notorious for its women safety issues. There are still a lot of boys-only and girls-only government schools in the city. What are your thoughts on such schools? Do you think the government can do more in enabling better, healthy relationship between both genders from a young age? Wow. Amazing.

RemindMe! 14 hours  My questions to Atishi:

1. AAP has done wonderful work in primary education. What is your vision for professional and higher education?
2. In view of the looming threat of AI taking over most lower level jobs in about a decade, what is your vision for education which will make students employable in the future? Why is the Marlena last name suddenly getting dropped everywhere? This is GRAND! This is so huge. Good work!!!  u/kash_if where is the AMA post? Woah. This is great!! Looking forward to it. [deleted] Will you become the Education Minister of India in a future coalition government?  To Atishi 


1. What changes does India need in higher education, professional courses?


2. What freedoms should parents provide their children to develop as a better person?


3. Does the super costly schools(where mostly the very rich study) teach something unique that is a challenge to bring to the government schools?


4. What do you do when you are not working for education or advising AAP?


5. What message do you want to give to the youth in their 25 to 35 years of age? Continue working, take courses? anything you want to say


6. What are your long term plans for education if you keep doing what you are doing for a decade or more?


7. Is the AAP government working on any promising long term solution for pollution? Are the kids motivated to take charge?

8. Have you been approached by any other state or center to do your work at a larger scale? We would love to have you India's HRD Minister. If AAP pushes your name as HRD minister - you might actually get support from other parties and wider constituents. Best of luck for Lok Sabha elections. Shit

OR

eat the stale thing first and average the taste over two things?

P.S.: This is a throwaway",intraday_trader," Bhatiaji kamaal kar diya, crorepati ban gaye.

1. Most people believe intraday is like gambling, what do you say?

2. And how much time did it take to become a master in trading? Is it your full time job?

3. Also do you have some insider information that us plebs can't even fathom? Finally! 

I'm a CA student and have maintained a decent portfolio. I have a few (many) questions for you. üòäüòä

1. What reading material would you suggest to a young **investor** to get a grip of trading?
2. I once lost 10k in an intra day trade. Haven't dared to trade again. How to get out of the fear?
3. How to get a good grasp of trading in futures?
4. Do you use algo trading? If yes, how did you learn to code and what books have you read to be good at algo trading?
5. How do you maintain your cool when you incur a big loss on a bad day? 
6. Can you tell us more about your daily lifestyle? Your routine etc. Seems like you beat u/risingsteam 's allegation from the last year post that you were just a lucky orangutun.

> ""I would like you to imagine a national coin-flipping contest. Let‚Äôs assume we get 225 million Americans up tomorrow morning and we ask them all to wager a dollar. They go out in the morning at sunrise, and they all call the flip of a coin. If they call correctly, they win a dollar from those who called wrong. Each day the losers drop out, and on the subsequent day the stakes build as all previous winnings are put on the line. After ten flips on ten mornings, there will be approximately 220,000 people in the United States who have correctly called ten flips in a row. They each will have won a little over $1,000.

  


> Now this group will probably start getting a little puffed up about this, human nature being what it is. They may try to be modest, but at cocktail parties they will occasionally admit to attractive members of the opposite sex what their technique is, and what marvelous insights they bring to the field of flipping.

  


> Assuming that the winners are getting the appropriate rewards from the losers, in another ten days we will have 215 people who have successfully called their coin flips 20 times in a row and who, by this exercise, each have turned one dollar into a little over $1 million. $225 million would have been lost, $225 million would have been won.

  


> By then, this group will really lose their heads. They will probably write books on ‚ÄúHow I turned a Dollar into a Million in Twenty Days Working Thirty Seconds a Morning.‚Äù Worse yet, they‚Äôll probably start jetting around the country attending seminars on efficient coin-flipping and tackling skeptical professors with, ‚ÄúIf it can‚Äôt be done, why are there 215 of us?‚Äù

  


> By then some business school professor will probably be rude enough to bring up the fact that if 225 million orangutans had engaged in a similar exercise, the results would be much the same ‚Äî 215 egotistical orangutans with 20 straight winning flips."" Kudos on crossing 1cr on trading. I have a couple of questions for you.

1. What got you into trading in the first place. Any insight into your background?

2. What was the learning curve involved.
How did you reach where you are right now? Can you break it up into the skills (and necessary sources) and other resources needed to start off? How did you start learning. How can begginers learn to do this. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Is this your full time job or you do it part time?
2. How many days of the year you work in one year?
3. How many hours you spend per day? How much capital do you need to start with to make investing your full time job ? So that one can live off the profits and doesn't need to do other jobs to earn a living. What‚Äôs your basic strategy - Momentum trading , special situations ? Also did you ever calculate your sharpe ratio. 

Congrats on hitting 1cr hope you make 10x out of it ! Congratulations. wow! do you recommend any book a beginner can get. 1. Do you hold stock positions for more than one day if the position is making loss on that day? 
2. Whats your average trade size? Like, how many RIL shares will you buy in one go before squaring it off?
3. which sectors are your favourite? I burned my hands trying to stay invested in auto stock Biggest loss amount? What are your most common trading instruments? Do you think mutual funds is a good investment strategy ? Between real estate and mutual funds which would you pick ? do you trade as an individual or have you set up an LLC or something?  Can you spill some secrets on how to win in intraday? I‚Äôve made a few thousands trading but mostly I am holding long because I can‚Äôt win consistently in intraday. What strategy should I use? Also, which TA tool is the best? I personally use only BB, RSI and MACD. What would you recommend to a person who wants to get into it and maybe pursue trading as a side business while studying? How much tax have you paid on the CG? ever get stuck with an intraday short you could not cover by EOD? What's your age and when did you started intraday trading? I don't want you to dispense any misconceptions my way. I've enough of my own, thanks. [deleted] Can you give a short introduction on how to start trading and where to start, what books to read, sites you recommend and scams to avoid, for a noob like me. I don‚Äôt understand leverage in stock market did you use technical analysis?
if not, please describe your strategy. I dont have any spare money.

How can I get started with this? Intra day trader! I actually don‚Äôt believe in technicals, charts don‚Äôt work. That‚Äôs why most of the intra day traders don‚Äôt make it. But the people look at the candles and what not and still make money. May be it works but I just can‚Äôt bring myself to believe it does. Congrats to you though for making lots of money! Congrats I want to start trading too, what are the formal procedures(bank accounts etc) to get started and how to choose a broker.
Also suggest the simplest way to get started Few questions : 
a) What percentage of your trade are Intraday ? 
b) How long on an average are your non intraday trades ?
c) if there are 10 metrics you measure for making a buy/sell call what are those ? would love to know some of the statistics on your trades. especially win/loss ratio, number of trades. I am en engineer by profession and would like to explore the world of trading. I have absolutely 0 knowledge on the subject. I just read you recommending Rupee tales by Zerodha. Any Youtube channels instead? Thanks for the AMA. I have always looked down upon trading as everyone I know lost their money in the market (my dad, my mama etc). I am in a comfortable place in IT right now and I can take a bit of the risk with my money. Please know that I know absolutely nothing about trading.

I see you recommend zerodha varsity. But the question is, can one start with capital as small as 1 lakh? Just to test the waters? Would you recommend intraday trading for a guy with a regular 9 - 5 job? I feel there are two knowledge components: one is understanding the technical stuff like what is a short. 

The other part is following the industry - daily news and analysis which allows you to make informed decisions. What sources do you recommend for this?

What is your view on Zerodha smallcases? I don't have the time to trade intraday. Is it viable to make money through swing trading over a few days? Kind of a stupid question. Which brokerage firm do you use for trading? Who provides the best online platform for trading in India? WoW. Congrats Manu vai. Have you tried your hand at CryptoCurrency trading? Or at least ever held any Crypto? When should a person start investing and how much of his income should he invest and where to get decent profits and stable passive income. I am a beginner and am interested in concept of dividend funds, are they helpful in the long run? How you do you differentiate between a pull back and a reversal? Which technique do you rely on?
Technical, fundamental or quantitative? [deleted] 1. Do you stay alone? Or with your parents?
2. If you live with family, what do they think of your work? Do you have your setup in a room?
3. Do you sell naked OTM puts? So I am someone with high risk appetite and have a few lacs that I want to invest (or rather I want to experiment with). But I don't want to do intraday trading full time, so what goals should I set myself? Also, do you mainly invest on stocks or do you bet on macroeconomic aspects as well? For professionals who dont have time but still want to have a investment going in stocks ,what would be your best advice...?
Also how much return should i realistically be looking for.
I have few investments with bluechip and as per their advice ,have invested in few mutual funds.
Should i do anything differently.? If I can spare a decent amount of capital, what would you recommend as my starting reading material? 

In no hurry to make quick money 1) Which software you are using?
2) How many people you have hired?
3) How you keep check on greed and need of your investment?
4) what are the major complications in this business? I'm not 18 legally. But I started trading through my father this year. I turned 10K to 13.5K in March when I started, then bought ALBK. My father said I'm making too many trades. So I'm waiting till August to invest via my own account. I have a few questions, and anybody can answer them:

1. How do I invest 10K? There is no way I can increase my capital or whatever 10K is. I really want to trade and learn the craft.

2. Which online broker should I use?

3. How do I stay on top of the news? Wanted to understand about your technique. These signals that you talk about, they automatically which means you are using an API? Which brokers provide a good set. Also, any of them provide intraday volumes as well along with price? Investing is mostly going against the tide (buy stocks with bearish sentiments) whereas trading is going with the tide (follow market sentiments).  
How much do you agree with the above statement? So you are telling us all you had more than 200% annualised returns thats more than 2 bps per trade on average assuming you made fewer than 10,000 trades(Thats is an already an absurdly large number of trades)!!! Wow!!!

That is so unbelievable I don't even believe you :/

But hey man fair play to you if its true. I think you would be among the most successful trader of all time. Do you believe in technical analysis? Especially in intraday trading. Hi Manu, I am regular 24 year old with a job that doesn't allow me to day trade. However, i'd still like to get started with investing: trading, funds and other financial instruments to supplement my income. Where can I start? Are there any courses you would suggest?

I do not mind paying for training on how to invest. I only ask that it fits into my lifestyle, and doesn't require me to invest multiple hours at end. Hey man, late to the party. NRI swing trader here and what you're doing is beyond my ultimate dream so I have a few questions for you.

1. Did you test your strategies on international markets (like on demo accounts). I'm curious if it's work on NASDAQ and NYSE

2. Do you place both long and short positions or just long?

3. It's a very bullish market. If I had invested in almost any tech stock a year ago, I'd have doubled my money. What makes your strategy stand out?

5. Did your position size get bigger as your account grew or did you always trade with same size.

4. Any tips to make 2% a week? just couple days ago was thinking about you wondering where are you right now. and bamm here you are. Would you say that to trade successfully it needs to be a full-time job? Meaning someone occupied 10 hours every day in another job can't possibly spare the time to learn the right information. This is some WSB level shit. You are quoting 30% returns as predictable in your comments. It‚Äôs all fun and games when we are in a 10 year bull market but I feel bad for the idiots who‚Äôre going try this and lose everything!

Yeah I made a killing betting on tech stocks over the past two years but I‚Äôm not stupid enough to claim my intelligence had anything to do with it. I'm not from a business/engineering background. Got no idea about trading but know that starting early is better. I'm already in my early 20s. What do I do? How do I start investing with minimal income? What will be your advice to someone who doesn't know anything about trading but wants to make money of it. How do I start? Would you do an AMA after you lose your money too? Hey congrats question do you keep tight Stop-loss for your strategy means in terms of profit in percent how much is your stop-loss for each trade? Have you ever thought increasing capital impacts return of your strategy due to slippage? Hello friend. I am learning for investing into stock I am learning by watching youtube videos. Can you guide what would be a better way to learn more into investing stocks? Background: I used to work for a large hedge fund in a technology role. The hedge fund employed quantitative strategies in addition to a large array of research analysts.

I have been trading on my own for more than a year. I have had some great profits, and great losses.

I wrote this for all those who think they can make quick money in the market by choosing a security and choosing a time and direction. Listen up.

You are an uninformed trader. You do not have any special information about the future which is not also available to the professionals.

All ""easy"" informed trading is done almost immediately by computers. An example is: stock A is at $10. There is new information which is clearly bullish. Within a second, the stock will be at $12. The new price reflects the new information. You cannot beat the computers at informed trading.

New ""complex"" information about an asset has to be analysed and accepted by others for it to be trade-worthy. You can not hope to be a better analyst than professionals who have training, tools and access to insiders. That doesn't mean all analysts are right or in agreement, but only that their opinion is more informed than yours. Again, you cannot hope to profit using analysis of ""complex"" information if the market doesn't agree with you. Reading a Seeking Alpha article (and the comments) is not analysis.

After the information is priced in, any further price movement is driven by supply-demand and not by new information. You cannot guess at supply-demand. It happens in real time and big traders fiercely protect the content of their future orders. I laugh at people who buy $TWTR AFTER getting the information that Jack Dorsey also bought some last week. There may be a sentiment rally if others start buying, there may not be. You really don't know.

Charting is useful only in hindsight. Prior price/volume action has no bearing on future price/volume action. You say pivot points? Let us say SPY is reaching 237.00 from above. Everybody says it is an important ""support"". What does that mean? Will it break that support or not? If it breaks, will it go much lower, or bounce back up to reclaim the support? Again, you don't know. Today SPY broke and bounced off that support 3 or 4 times before definitively breaking down. Which break-down is definitive? It is only clear in hindsight.

Now, all the above should make it clear that, in essence, you are an uninformed trader, that is, you are trading blind. That means, charitably speaking, that your chances of the asset moving in a favorable direction are 50-50.

But still you will lose. There are two reasons for this. One relates to the way trades happen, and other is about human psychology.

(a) If you place a limit buy or limit sell, your order will only execute while the ticker is moving unfavorably to you. 
  That is, if the stock is moving down from your limit buy price, your buy order will execute. And if it is moving up beyond your limit sell price, your sell order will execute. In each case (unless you are closing a trade), you are immediately at a loss as the price continues its movement.

( If the price is not moving much, you are immediately at a loss due to the bid/ask spread.  And you likely bought because you thought it was a bargain and the recent past showed a downward price movement and you were bullish on it.  More often than not, price movement continues in the same direction.  Reversals are rare and hard to time.)

This means, that

(b) You immediately are in pain. You see a loss and will likely see it widening as the price movement continues.

Now you have many options:

i) You can exit the trade at a loss. Bummer.

ii) You can execute another trade in the same direction to average your price. This again suffers from the same problem. The price is moving away from you while all your orders execute. Your new trade is as uninformed as the last one.

iii) You can hold the bag, ""hoping"" for a reversal.

Both in (ii) and (iii), you are now holding the bag.

Let us talk about that.

Usually, the price will continue to move while you see the red becoming redder. You regret the trade. You are stressed. You have averaged it 3, maybe 4 times already. You want to at least exit at break-even.

Therefore, as soon as the price reverses and it shows you a modest profit, you will itch to book the profit and relax. Hence, you will make the all-too-common (but understandable) trader mistake of holding your losers and quitting your winners. After the trade shows some green, because you have experienced the red, you will be afraid that it will again go red. You will be wanting to not go through that pain again.

Therefore you will usually see losers in your portfolio with a loss % of 20 or even 50, but you will never see that kind of profit %. Ever. You would have booked the profit at 2% or 5%.

So what's the consequence? Even assuming each trade has a 50-50 chance of going your way, your losses will always be bigger than your winners.

Eventually, you will curse trading and seek gainful employment.

Hope it was helpful.

 What about if you use stop limits with market orders and trade into ""momentum""? This can work, some of the time.  How do you determine that the momentum is going to continue and not reverse soon after?  But the main problem is the stops.  If you have a tight stop, volatility will take you out.  If you have a wide stop, your loss will be wide too.  Figuring out a proper stop based on ""pivot points"" and past realized volatility is not that straightforward, but it can work if enough other people believe in your pivot point too.

I still trade, but am a more humble trader after the experiences.  It is possible to develop an edge, but it takes specialized skills and hard work.

TL;DR: If you don't have a well-defined edge, you cannot hope to day trade for profit in the long term. Saar job milegi? When will you get a real job? [deleted]",2019-05-11 19:37:07

AMA.",180,bgsh11,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bgsh11/im_a_16lpm_elite_mba_who_cant_find_a_job_ama/,239,I graduated from one of the best b-schools of India. I did fairly well (top 20% of my batch) and got a good placement. But the company went bankrupt after 2 years. I've been looking for a new job for the last 3 months but haven't been able to find anything.,evilbombadil," A lot of times companies just don't process your resume after looking at your previous salary. This has been very apparent in software professionals who switched to a software job in a financial institution (jpmc, Nomura etc) and then left it. Is 1.6 lakh a decent salary for an elite MBA grad? Do you think number of jobs have decreased in the market now as compared to say 3 years ago? Hah 3 months is rich, took.me 6 to even get a job..... 

Hold tight man , it will come. Did you take education loan, if yes then how much, if no then what was your total kharcha for the MBA? As someone who is doing a job after BBA and is stuck between doing Papa ka business or making a career by myself. Is MBA worth the 20-30L of investment? I am 33 year old planning to do 1 year MBA from IIM A/B/C/L or XLRI. I am typical Indian IT male (IIM) with average academics. 

Reason for MBA: I am working in IT service industry for past 9 years and always intrested in learning and growing. But now my growth is staganat and only option is to get into Management. So why not get MBA Degree and jump state career as manager in IT.

Should I do MBA ? 

Keep looking buddy you will find the Job soon. Is it worth doing an MBA, if even without it you're earning that much within roughly 4 years of graduating? Vaguely related, but as a non Indian it has always wondered me why so many people start an MBA at such a young age in India. In the Netherlands (where I am from) it is considered very weird to do an MBA without having at least around 4-5 years of work experience. Combined with the fact that most people enter the workforce here at a later age as well results in most people taking their MBA while being in their late 20s/early 30s. And isn't that the original purpose of an MBA anyway, to do it only after having a decent amount of experience (but I might be misguided here)? It's been tough, but while searching for new openings I hope you're also enjoying this free period while it lasts ( hope it doesn't last too much though).  
   
Btw apart from the money you made, you regret anything about the professional world of the elites? What job role were you doing? Which location are you looking for? MBA in what?
I may be able to refer you if something matches. will you work in a company that would pay 20%-30% less than your previous pay? Among HR, marketing and finance if you had to pick one which would you select based on the demand? Was the company a startup? Campus placement? Can relate to this situation. Hope you land a good job!   
Incase you are looking for some leads, do DM. We are hiring in my team. Need good finance knowledge. How/Why did your company go bankrupt? At what age did you get your job at 1.4 lakhs pm ? What was your CAT %ile/GMAT? (Optional :P)

Do you regret taking a niche job instead of consulting/IB etc. ?

Does your academic history before MBA matter much after MBA? Why did it fail? And what do you think the founders/management could have done differently to save it? What would have you done? 

Also, is the product still 'out there'? I feel joy in reviving past/broken/failed products, if only money was a constraint. alumni help nahi karta ? [deleted] Bhai, when i read your story, I had to check whether I had posted it myself. Only difference is I was fired for factors within and without my control. I had taken this unemployment thing a bit lightly - my company gave me three months time to find another job. The first month went with a flurry of interview from good companies - flunked them all since I was under prepared and tensed.
The second month, I took a step back, started reading and playing PUBG. I am now in the third month and have recently started applying. You situation seems to have added a sense of urgency now and thank you for that. I am currently not too worked up since I have the finances to pay off the loan and live unemployed for quite a few months at home.

However the prospect of continued unemployment is now looking a bit worrisome. I have started working on constructive habits such as waking up at 6:00 AM, meditating, exercising - key habits that have let me down in the past and hopefully will help me in the future. I am more concerned how my parents will react  - I haven't told them yet. 

Any help in this regard will very helpful. It's unclear if you ""can't find a job"" because of being picky about offers or because you haven't gotten an offer.   
Either way, your asset is the network, not the degree. Check your college email ID for job leads. Post on your alumni telegram and whatsapp groups, preferably also the city group and not only the batch group. And spend less time on reddit till this is over.  


Source: Am a 1.6lpm ""elite"" MBA who can find a job any week of the month 1.6lpm on paper or in hand? 

Any previous experience prior to MBA? 
MBA in what? 

PM me your resume, will refer in my company if I like it. Salary shouldn't be a problem if you are good. First of all sorry for your situation. Have you tried working in start ups for stocks rather than huge salary? The reason I am asking this is because, I am from a similar B school and initially I worked in a small start up for gaining experience. With just a 5 minute video, I want you to help me understand with real examples about what you studied in MBA and what type of things you do on job.

Because a lot of people say ""Bro become a software developer they earn 2.3lpm"" but very few people talk about the annoying and nerdy codes they write for hours. What about job referrals through buddies? Beyond a point depending on recruiters doesnt make sense... especially if you are in 1.6lpa bracket. Dear OP,
Please tell me which area of business you want to work in - Ops, Analytics, HR, Finance or Strategy. If you wish it so, I can help you with a referral at my current org, provided there are matching opportunities and you are also similarly inclined.
Thanks. Get to Bangalore, make a list of 50 companies and walk into their offices with a flower bouquet and 2 senior contact names. Ask to meet them and ask for a job.

&#x200B;

Two companies per day and in four weeks, you will have atleast a dozen leads. Is your salary expectation a factor? Are you Lord of the rings fan? What did you major in before your MBA? I hope you won't mind answering 

I am doing btech rn in a relatively new field (biotechnology) I have absolutely no interest in research and would like to get into a corporate job.
How exactly should I plan my career?
I am planning on finishing my degree, get a job, leave it after a year or two and get an MBA and get back to the corporate world.

Also, have you tried getting a job abroad? Hey Bro! There are lots of referral groups on WhatsApp and other social media for Top MBA college students. You can try subscribing to those. A lot of my friends having your mentioned salary switched jobs using these groups. Okay. Prepared for the down-votes so here goes. Sorry bout your situation, but this is only the start of an epidemic. Our gen needs to wake up from this MBA gold rush. Working as an AI programmer, I can bet my balls this is a trend that will grow exponentially in the coming years.

Management is a dead industry. Why? Cause A.I! Management is part of occupations that you can  term 'pseudo-expertise'. When a $12/month EC2 cluster can be trained to make the same decisions as you why would I expend 40L/year? That's just reality and the sooner we get with it the better.

Jolkien Rolkien Rolkien Tolkien approves [It's Mohanlal Karamchand Gandhi according to Mudiji.](https://youtu.be/LjT4y8Xs-Ls) The biggest clown ever to come out of Indian News Media.  Arnab Goswami first gets a high quality induction heating plate on his chair, switches it on and then the camera starts rolling. Even if his ass shits bricks, it's hot shit.

EDIT: This seems irrelevant and petty objection by altnews, but now the jingoists have to choose between BMKJ and Ambedkar, neither of which they can sacrifice to appear populist. He has proven himself a incompetent on multiple occasions 

At the time of ama on r/india. He was not able to answer questions which he was supposed to do.

He is a sellout. Evidence you demand well its his entire channel. Funded by rich and powerful. Best source of biased news.
 
He is not a news anchor but a loud and violent speaker. Man I wonder how much decibels can he generate?

INDIA WANTS TO KNOW!

Well I want to know how can he make mistake at something so basic.

 Now this is news ? good thing he did not call him narendar. I am sure that day will come too.

Can someone on his panel ask him to sing vande mataram on live tv? Arnab @$utiya hai! This is why I call every great figure in history, 'John Cena'. >Mohanchand Karamdas Gandhi

I personally feel glad he isn't involved in decision-making of any manner when it comes to foreign policy or we'd have been the mutation of Iran and N Korea by now. And I have seen a lot of criticism his way being deflected away cuz he's in the Army and 'been there..served there' narrative always comes into the  picture. he shouldn't get a pass on criticism just cuz he serves in the armed forces I would love to see this cry baby when Modi is booted out of power Modi syndrome Arnab is the poor man's Alex Jones. Not as good cause Alex Jones can actually be entraining. Arnab just parrots what he knows what his audience will jerk off to If Arab shift delete  Just because of these stupid i have forgot his actual name, damn confusing!! Changing ""names"" is his masters favorite hobby, he's only following his master. This should come in tommorow's satya show. I didn't go through the article but is it that uncommon for a name to me said lil bit wrong, doesn't matter it's a famous one or not.

Is it because the person concerned is Gandhi?

EOD it's a name and we are humans,isn't mispelling common for us.
 Oh My God. Arnab said Mohanchand instead of Mohandas. 

What a travesty. What have they done to the media. What a fall in standards. Why isn't this on the front page of all the newspapers. ",2018-08-25 17:54:02

[deleted]  glasses gone Swag mode on üòÅ What did the doctor say about the long term effects ? I'm too thinking of doing LASIK but I've heard in most cases eye sight gets dull again after a few years. Thanks for posting, this has been very informative for someone planning on getting lasik. lasik se tum gori ho gayi ho..

&#x200B;

/s [deleted] I got this procedure done 3 years ago. AMA Can cylindrical correction be fixed via Lasik? How does it feel being a girl on r/india ?  How many DMs you have got till now? Did your office cover it? Or personal expense? How much vision did you get back. ?

I got 90% back.

&#x200B; Has this boosted your confidence? And do people act differently around you since you no longer wear glasses?  How many years did you wear glasses for? It sounds weird but I've worn glasses for half my life and I feel like it'll be weird to get used to not having them (though I'd love to not be dependent on them all the time) Do you think not having glasses now has changed your personality in some ways? I got mine done in 2013, I wonder how much has changed since then. I have the same power. Can you give me your specs? lol my brother got a lasik recently, now he is the hot one. So you got your surgery done and doctors advised to avoid screen exposure and here you are hosting AMA. Good god, lady, go and sleep. LASIK gang hi5. Got it done 3yrs back. Was -6.

Also, I got cooler shades after the procedure. Huh!  Exact procedure name? 

Hospital?

Total cost?

Totally corrected or you still need glasses? [deleted] What is the cost of the treatment?  Why do you look more excited before surgery than after it though? Btw was your vision stable for a few years? How long did the full procedure take? Is LASIK risk free?  I get anxiety thinking I might lose my sight. Did insurance cover your surgery? How have you adjusted to your non glasses look? Did you asked your doctor about PRK? If so did he recommended it? Damn. I feel like a retard. People are asking question while I'm scratching my head because I didn't understand the post itself Did you have astigmatism? I‚Äôd like to correct my vision, but apparently I‚Äôm not a good candidate because of astigmatism.   Getting lasik done was one of the best decision of my life. it's been five years now. Having thick specs throughout school added to my introversion and social anxiety and kind of made me waste a lot of years under insecurities. after lasik, being active was easier, not needing to pick up glasses first thing in morning was a big big freedom. somehow it helped me become a better person. I won't say I'm completely free of social anxiety but with better confidence its easier to handle life.  

Today I and everyone have forgotten that I ever wore glasses. I don't have any photo from my school life.  but every once in while I still think about the freedom lasik got me and I feel grateful for being able to see clearly.

Enjoy the freedom and take care of your eyes.  Just when I thought of getting LASIK done, this AMA comes up. Good thing to be honest. I'm trying to get  Contoura Vision Eye Surgery which also is a type of LASIK. My question is how many days did the doctor advice you to not look directly at the sun or any bright objects? I mean how many days after you can return to your normal life style, job, using computer etc.? Opti-Lasik made you cool ..will hit on right girl for sure I am 17 with -7.2 vision. Reading this thread is a huge relief. Thank you. It's cool that the doctors changed ur dress and pumped some protein in u for no extra cost AMA? 

PM me your phone number.  Don‚Äôt mean to be rude but what‚Äôs the point of this? Why is their a advertisement in that washroom?
Is that your office or what?  Is their any risk? 

On the side note, how did you manage to be so skinny?  How long has your prescription been stable? I think I have similar power and was looking at Lasik, did they inform you of the risks? If the surgery goes wrong, do you just go blind? Your top matches you bag/jacket or whatever it is you‚Äôre holding or it‚Äôs just a dirty mirror? :P Hey! my girlfriend is planning to get it done, I am a little bit concerned about it. Is there anything she must know about the procedure, apart from the usual that you can't be out for a month?  Is there a minimum power for which the surgery takes place? How old are you?what's minimum age requirement? Hi, how much time does it require to recover
I am planning for one, but will have work commitments  Which phone is that?  Can you also tell us what was your power last year and a year before last year? 

I wanted to get LASIK done to my eyes this year, my power was constant for last 2-3 years and just this year it decreased to -4.5 from -5. Doctor said to wait for one more year.  Total cost and recovery time? So, for how long you will be away from work??  I can't tell the difference in your eyes, though I do notice that you're wearing completely different clothing, different eye piece, changed hair style, are now wearing a backpack. What am I missing ? Is there any age limit/barrier to get this done? is it worth it?  I envy people who can get LASIK done. I‚Äôve been waiting for a decade till I would turn 18 and when I did I was told that there‚Äôs risk that my retina might get detached again. Well I guess I‚Äôll have to stick to contacts and specs for the rest of my life.  why Lasik why not SMILE eye surgery? I see most of your comments were 2 hours ago, so you'll probably not reply. Anyway. 

How do you avoid eye strain post surgery, seeing as screens are everywhere and I'm assuming you didn't take a vacation or a 'tech cleanse'(?)...?

Also, what's the best place to get some parathas in Bangalore.? what was the cost of opreation?? You became a Badass!
 Nice. Do you know if someone with higher order aberrations in their vision can get corrective surgery? Mine is -3 cyl left eye.. I was advised not to go for LASIK as my cyl power is high.. I am optimistic now looking at you . Someday! How much did it cost ? u/_hein_ ok i have some similar doubts, i also reside in Bangalore, do you have astigmatism on your left eye?, if so, is it in just one eye? 

i can see vertical double vision with just one eye closed on my right, meaning even if i close my left eye, it doesnt matter i can still see double, TEXT and right below it a shadow TEXT, i wanted to know if you also have the same problem and if did LASIK solve it, because i can't read properly as night arrives and can't read text on dark backgrounds, can't drive at nights as i can see everything twice from lights on street to vehicles that it gets annoying to drive at all at night.  So what are we suppose to do, look into her eyes? was the anesthesia  local or generalised? [deleted] Only one question. Why the AMA?  kiran rao? That neck though.

Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate.

"" Why do Indians on reddit never learn about how to do an AMA? Failure after failure after failure It's really quite amusing how he mentions that he is an IIT Alumni and CEO... Look man, we are all supportive of new startups but you gotta learn humbleness and how to sell an idea.

 Putting your background info on display instead of features and USP of product clearly shows that you lack confidence in your own product. Grade A chutiya.

Was this AMA enough, guy? LOL! How do you if someone is from IIT? They tell you in the first sentence lol. Wow... it is very interesting to see people commenting on my AMA in an entirely separate group. I am that CEO from the AMA.  


Of the many things said here, people have criticized the ""waving of IIT tag"". There were two reasons for that:  
1. People don't trust that we can build good products out of India and they necessarily have to come from US / China / other countries. We hope to change that by bringing a product from India to the world.  
2. This product was designed in labs of IIT Bombay. This is our way of giving the due credit to the institute.

&#x200B;

Could we have worded it better? Absolutely. What was good however was that people asked some very relevant questions about drones globally, drones in India and industry in general and I really enjoyed answering them.  


I appreciate this thread and the AMA, especially because:  
1. It showed us how passionate people are on Reddit  
2. Good learning on what mistakes to avoid on the platform. failing how ? anyone here into drones? can you recommend me one? Just went through the thread. Too much technical jargon. Anybody care to explain the cringe? Thanks! ",2018-09-08 08:48:37

Any instances where you've felt lonely? How did you deal with it?  Hum kaale hain toh kya hua, apna time ayega Get an escort ? There shouldn‚Äôt be any taboo since we are all spending money for company, in one way or another  One of my earlier rejection stories:

After finishing engineering, I had to be at home for almost 2.5 years before I got the offer letter. Almost everyone who got hired with me, had their jobs delayed. (This was like 15 years back).

Anyways, I was really excited about the job and I was in training where I saw this beautiful lady in the same class. I had this instant crush, but no balls to walk up to her to talk. I did not really know it was called as 'dating', but you would just ask them for coffee at CCD and it meant that only. Or you would write a letter and give them. 

So, training was for 3 months and 2.5 months had already passed. Once training is done, you can be posted anywhere. Also, back then I used to be enthusiastic at trying atleast lol. 

At that day when the class finished, I walked behind her and said 'excuse me'. Which she didn't hear (or pretended to not to hear). I had to repeat and shout a little, when she stopped. She looked back and making an annoyed expression of what do you want. At this point, mera poora phat gaya tha. For couple of seconds, I didn't know what to say. I stammered and said something like do you want to have coffee. She got so angry and threw her water bottle at me. I have no idea why she did that. Then she said, do you even know who I am etc etc and asked me to get lost. 

That's it. Next two days, I avoided my training classes (which were mandatory). Later, training finished and I never saw her again.

can share more, but my comments are not appearing. Did you ever take any steps to improve yourself to better sell yourself or put yourself out there? why didnt you do a quick bangkok trip? Dude, I feel for you. I'm just like you too. **M, 33, textbook virgin.** Never hand held any girl. Kissing a girl is in my bucket list. Have been too coward, poor and clueless to afford high class (safe) hooker. My parents have given up on me long ago and all my younger siblings are married now.  What's the point of having an AMA if you don't answer any of the questions?  I think you should get a dog for now. Who knows what the future might hold. Maybe the good boi could become your wingman. It's ok dude. Marriage is not everything in your life. Save enough for your retirement and have emergency funds. Focus on increasing your networth and enjoy your bachelorhood.  Am posting this without reading any of the other comments. There's two options you got:

1. If you MUST, find someone who NOBODY else wants to marry. A nice human being who would appreciate you for who you are. A widow or a differently abled person. And you may find love. 
2. Focus on your career and making, saving, and investing as much money as you can. And health of course. Then fuck bitches and whores (budget for it). 

The second option is my recommendation. Relationships are overrated; dont get into one and for fucks sake dont make little people. Fuck that shit; live for yourself. 

Building great friendships is more satisfying and fulfilling than chasing shitty ass romantic relationships. 

And learn to rock that shit; not everybody is handsome and attractive... with the right attitude, you can make ugly awesome! I would rather have an ugly but awesome friend than hang out with a handsome looking asshole.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I think your parent's social connection are weak, because there are many girls like you who desperately wants to marry someone and initiate normal family life, it's that you don't have reach to them (socially). The standard get rich/go to gym suggestions are silly. If that was the case more than half the men wouldn't get laid. I suggest the following:

1. This is also a failure of your social circle - your friends and family. Change who you hangout with. Make new friends. They have a responsibility to help you - remind them.

2. Most of my relationships started in *activites*. Badminton, board games, book clubs, cooking lessons etc. Find some activities and slowly improve your social skills. Even if there are only guys, they have friends and sisters they'll hook you up with.

3. Change your location. I don't know where you currently are but it's clearly not your destined place. Move to Goa or Himachal or a big city or even a different part of your current city.

 [deleted] You can go for hookers but the STDs are scary though. Not to offend you  but

What do you think is unattractive about you? Is it your physique, your expectations, or are you just ugly? (again, as a not so good looking guy I want to empathize your struggles and maybe share how you can improve)

What specific actions did you take to become desirable? Like did you start hitting the gym, wearing good clothes, being confident etc. ?

I'm 100% sure you can't be that repulsive ( Unless you have a physical disability..still its not 100% impossible). I would say maybe your standards are too high? 

Not to be condescending, because I'm going down this road and I think we should try to change our lives for the better :) Have u hit the gym to look fitter? Have you clothed smartly to show nice personality? Have you given helping hand to someone in need? Have you tried being part of office parties?

If answer to all these is yes - sanyaas le lo, kuch nahi honewala.

If answer is no - your parents should've belted your ass. *When rejections started coming in, I gave up*

Why so many rejections? Have you objectively analysed? 1. (Are you) / (Were you ever) interested in finding someone? 

2. Did you ever like somebody and actually approached them?  I am afraid I am seeing myself in you. 

But how do you hold up with your collegues? 

Do they also ignore/disrespect/avoid you?

Do you feel dumb sometimes because of not being able to hold conversations? I like how so many people are suggesting trips to Amsterdam or Bangkok or sex workers as if OP asked for advice on how to get sex  This is pretty interesting to me, both academically and personally. My questions:

What's your current occupation?

Did your parents look for a match ""below"" your status?

How is meeting all the relatives at weddings and parties like?

Have you come to terms with being a virgin loner for until some more time, or maybe even forever?

How is your mental health? Any signs of depression? Self harm? Addictions? Suicidal tendencies?

Do you smoke cigarettes? Drink regularly? Any hard drugs?

What are your religious views? Do you follow any particular philosophy of life?

I have a few more but would wait to see if you answer these. How are you now mentally? Did you have any kind of trauma growing up? Come friend, I will give you dosti wala lip kiss! How much porn do you watch? Never thought about hookers?  Are you happy? Have you found things in life that are fulfilling and meaningful? What are your hobbies? Remember you are a strong beautiful independent man that don't need no woman except Kali Maa. Your worth is not tied to how attractive women may or may not find you. I hope you're in a happy place emotionally speaking.  I mean unless you are physically deformed, I refuse to believe anyone is so ugly as to never get laid. A year of gymming, a decent haircut and some good clothes can go a long way [removed] In India, it is not at all a tough task to get married. All you need is money, are you well stuffed in that department ?  3 years till you become a Wizard. Me 10 years to go.

Ignore above congrats you are Wizard Harry. Apparently you become a Wizard at 30 for bring sexless  Why not lower your standards? Unattractive females with similar awkwardness? My two cents. If you are looking to get married search for girls of age just touching 35 because the social pressure would be enormous plus the age number will also add to it. Have you tried looking for a divorce or widowed girl as well ?? Just my opinion being a 28 yo woman and reading your statements -

‚Ä¢ stop calling yourself unattractive. By saying this  have put yourself on a sort of lower scale & are probably treating others - especially people who YOU find good looking as better than you. 
Fact - they are not better

‚Ä¢ socially awkward - have you ever analysed why you feel this way. Do you get anxiety when you enter a group of people, Or when you walk into a new place with unfamiliar faces?
Work on your confidence, watch some YouTube videos. Improve on your self worth & self esteem.
And stop caring what others think about you.
It doesn't matter, how you view yourself matters.

‚Ä¢ coming back to your title -
So you haven't had a sexual experience. 
If you're constantly thinking about that, it'll make matters worse .
And if you really want some experience, go on tinder or start a friends with benefits with someone who is interested in you.
In the end even the experience won't help you get over the lonely feeling that one craves.

‚Ä¢ people who are genuine & want real relationships can judge a person by their vibe.
If you're kind, genuine, helpful & a warm open person, you'll definately get really great women who would be interested in you.
But you have to build a personality for that, & not use excuses like I'm socially awkward, haven't had experience etc...
All that can be worked on. & I'm sure you have some role models or celebs. Watch how those people behave & carry themselves.
& Please stop going on your looks, or on anyone else's.


Hope this helps & sorry if I crossed any line Ye pubG wala hai kya? Lol I know I'll have the same faith. And guess what, I'll enjoy every moment of it. Marriage is overrated anyway. Amsterdam jao. somvar ke vart rakh bhai ladki jarur milegi pakka vada hai mera. Indian women are becoming independent as years go by and don't stay in marriages where the husband is an abuser or dowry problems, etc. So I think there are diorced women you can look out for or may be widows who lost their husband due to accident, etc.

Just go through matrimonial ads in news papers, you will surely find some one, don't give up, there is someone for you. Are you manglik? Women in India go for cash, not looks or personality.

But if you can't afford a new car, you can always go for second hand. Look in the ""caste no bar"" section of the matrimonials. They have all the divorc√©es and widows listed there. As a bonus, they'll be in your age range. And just to make you feel better, they usually have ""marriage not consummated"". Kind of like ""2 year old car, barely driven"". So even your parents won't mind. Bruv atleast you can bang a nice hooker just for the heck of it, nothing wrong if you keep the mortality aside. Posting on reddit or whatsapp wont solve the problem trust me. Just go and bang a bitch even if you have to pay, we will feel more relaxed and you wont be a Virgin after that I don't wish to karma-whore or hijack your Ama (though not really an ama if you do not reply, OP)

I'm in the same boat, kinda. I'm 21m, and haven't done those things either. My college is over, so I have no real way of meeting girls or anything now. Tinder really isn't my scene(not saying this to be one of those ""I don't think online dating is real"" people). Now I'm scared one day I'll be posting something like this too. It really is a hollow feeling man, I can almost physically feel the pain in my chest. Hope it gets better for you though, OP. 

Yes, I gym. No, I don't party coz most of my close friends are studying to be CAs, so I won't see them for the next 10 years. I work in my uncle's delivery firm, so no real work friends either. [deleted] [you should see this](https://twitter.com/Joydas/status/1101694386767912967) Have you visited /r/FA30plus or /r/ForeverAlone?
I'm Indian American and in your boat, except 31 years old. After how many rejections did you give up ? Just curios. Were you not comfortable comprising at all? I have seen street bums getting married.  What were the reasons for rejections?

 What line of work are you in? Do you feel like you are abnormal and something is not completely right with you? If yes, then how do you make peace with it? If no, then how do you avoid such feelings?  What kind of music do you like?  Why no hookers? Seriously. Has this affected your work life? Future me, how often and in what manner is this aspect of your life bright up by your friends and collegues?

An entirely new set of connections could alter the odds towards favourable. Have you considered marrying women from a poor background? What about someone is lower caste? If you are that desperate to marry, you should be okay with that. Most of them who are in the low economic class would be happy to marry someone who earns 1lpm. If feel if you don't don't have high expectations, it's not that hard to marry in India. Late here ... But I have a suggestion. If possible join a drama group or dance class even if you don't meet a girl there ... You may find the activity enjoyable. Were you at any point in your life not interested in marriages or relationships? I want to confirm, coz i am now at that point and not sure whether i regret about this in future. If you are not finding a partner, lower your standards.

Homeless, crippled, ugly as fuck  mofos find a wife. Why can't you?

 But are you willing to lower  your standards? Is it worth it? Now that, is another matter. Bro try some divorced women market. You will get easily one.no point in growing old alone  Sorry Late to the AMA...so here is my question...
You said you were tired of the rejection but how many eligible women did you reject?  You shouldn't feel bad. I seriously don't understand why marriages and relationships are hyped so much.. 

Please have intercourse to break the assumption.

Enjoy life to the fullest mate. Hey. Have you considered therapy and meditation? If you're not happy with yourself, you can't meet anyone. Confidence alone can get you places. 

How many of the rejections you have hat are because of your mind bringing up past rejections? It is your mind that is sabotaging a lot of the times, since you can't communicate with being frozen with fear and self conciousness. 

Find a good counsellor in your area (preferably Cognition Based Therapy). I know people whose lives have turned around because of that. Also, consider some form of meditation, or join Art of Living or some other meditation based support group.

Let me emphasize this. It is important to fix what you feel is wrong with yourself. You have to realise the value of this life and not give up on making it better. Pm if you wanna talk. 

Cheers :) ""I know how you feel"", because I'm just 4 years behind you. How does it feel to be not attractive? How does not being physically attractive affect the way you are treated in day to day life? What advice do you have for physically undesirable men? Dude there are many girls in there 30s who are also not getting married 

Apparently the corporates are giving holiday to go look for brides and grooms  hmm interesting.  almost mid 30's F here and single by choice. Unlike you I've had enough share of relationship and have ruthlessly dumbed quit a few for vivid reasons. One of them (as I go through your post) is self-pity. 
So my only one peace of advice would be to stop crying and self loathing, get your act together. 


I honestly have never come across any smiling face that's ugly. Rest sense of humor, confidence, positive aura, good physic  blah blah can always be worked upon only if you wish to put that extra effort on it. 


To end my point all I want to say is, no one likes to hear anyone's  *randi rona*. 

Good Luck. 


   What do you mean hug-less? Give yourself a hug ! Hug your parents :)  I would suggest you to get a hobby and a dog. Might help you to kill some time. 1) go to gym

2) Find way to get rich. *Scrolls down the entire thread*

I did an AMA here a while ago. You can [read it here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/hi_india_im_a_pakistani_ama/)

It was honestly one of the most moving experiences of my life. People started off slightly aggressive, with downvotes and sarcasm, but by the end we were all laughing about saalans in icecream dabbas, ""Sharma jee ka beta"" mentality, newspaper liners in drawers, and swapping music and movies.

I'm so sad about the tragedies going on at our borders right now. To me, an Indian life lost is as big a travesty as a Pakistani life lost, and I know my Pakistani friends feel the same.

Hamari zubaan ek hai, rang ek hai, libas ek hai, aur ham ek waqt par ek hee hotay thay. Just because you say dibba and I say dabba doesn't mean we can't get along.

I just wanted to ask my Indian dost how you guys feel about what's happening, and wondering if there's anything the people - you and I - can do to make things better?

**This is a time for dialogue and friendship and acceptance. Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.**

Please talk to me, and tell me your points of view.

Love you guys!

Dhanyawaad!",WhereIsLordBeric," It warms my heart to see your kind message.

People from both counties need to not respond to hate with hate. This doesn't mean that either side becomes a doormat. Definitely not. But I find it sad to see people take pride in the attack or retaliation. The loss of life is never something to take pride in or rejoice for.

I think it is important for us Indians to keep in mind that the terrible attack was by terrorists and extremists and not every Pakistani. That most of the people of Pakistan condemn the act. For this, it would help if Pakistanis could openly vocally condemn too. 

It will really help matters if there is interaction between our communities. A lot of the distrust is out of ignorance, out of just not knowing better. It is understandable given our histories and excusable if it hasn't done genuine harm. People have been fed incorrect data on the other nation and nothing but more awareness, more truth can fix this. 

Most importantly, I would like to mention is that I'm Indian and we say dabba at home. I did not go through the previous AMA so if it was acknowledged that some Indians do say dabba and dibba is just much more common then forgive me for bringing it up again. 

Edit: I realize I haven't asked a question here but I am looking to discuss ways to control the situation. Also I did want to ask about how it's portrayed by Pakistani news but someone already did.  Im scared. I have no clue how any of this is going to play out, I hope to god that this is just for the election and both sides will de escalate soon but I'm honestly worried I Might get drafted.maybe I'm paranoid, but we're talking about a possible nuclear war. What scares me most is how Indians seem to be reacting to the new if the strikes. I don't understand how people can be celebrating sending a missile into another country. Yeah sure it was terror camps, but we shouldn't celebrate that. We should do it with reluctance. War is the last refuge of the incompetent. It shouldn't be worshipped. I was talking to one of my friends last night and as she was going she said ""main sone chali neend mein thode Pakistani maarne hai"" 

I was shocked and offended so badly how someone so young ( I'm 19 she's 18 ) can have some much hatred. I get the anger that Pakistan **might** house terrorists and it's a matter of concern for both of the countries. Later on I ended up arguing and saying that people like her is why war comes into the picture.

But I see so many people with so much hatred towards innocent people who just have no hatred towards our country. It makes me feel sad. 

I'm grateful there people like you who try to resolve and talk things rationally instead of going berserk and spreading hate.

I've seen enough documentaries and talked to enough American war veterans to know how bad and traumatic war is. I'd never wish Something like this upon any of the countries.

I just hope all of this ends soon and no more lives are lost. 

Thank you for your efforts. Peace.  Elections are coming, they will end and so will all the chaos. day by day I am becoming a big fan of reddit in this time of tension its heartening to see a discussion happening rather than abusing each other. I am not in FB as its extremely toxic and in twitter also people are baying for each other‚Äôs blood. war is a lose lose situation for both the countries, hope pakistani army will follow the geneva convention and send our brave pilot safe and sound and peace will prevail again. Whatever this is, this is made to look as an immediate response to a heinous attack on Indian soil through terror camps based out of Pakistan. It is a show of power, and it is something that has deep political implications because the elections are coming. The only big news is that munitions were actually dropped in another country. Indian jets have crossed Pakistani airspace for a while now but it was for surveillance only.  

This show of force isn't going to do anything because in the end the ISI/Military will be do what they have always done, send terrorists in with their blessings. Your governments have always been a puppet of the ISI. The utter humiliation of 1971 is not something anyone in the military has forgotten, nor will they ever forget. And Kashmir is just a playground for the proxy war and that is about it. In the end, the citizens will suffer. Both sides of the border. And jingoism will continue. In the end let us all agree that mutton biriyani is the best, and veg biriyani should be nuked.  [removed] Politics, attacks etc. may happen, but there is no need to hate a common Pakistani citizen staying in Lahore or Karachi who is busy minding his own job. I know we have these issues. They need to be solved mutually. Till then, you guys keep on producing music. We are producing our movies. Out of our hands really. Morons outnumber on both sides.  Welcome bhai.

Our leaders need sense.  There's absolutely no need for people to die.  Not Indian, not Pakistani.  At the end of the day we're all in this big messy world together.  This is so unnecessary.

Yes, love you guys too..
An Indian. Hi, can you help me understand why some Pakistanis are upset due to indian army shooting down terrorist camp. 

No civilian was harmed & no armyman was killed, so why the hate ?

and I have to say this, India & Pakistan is temporary, Chicken Biryani is forever. >Let's not let stupidity and fear and anger ruin what we've been trying to create.

It's because Elections are coming. This was the easiest and predicted way to cover up failure in governance. Hence this is the last refuge of any scoundrel who is in power. Hitler did it, Stalin did it, Gaddaffi and Saddam both did it to earn people's misguided belief. 

This can never happen in First world countries, knowing fully well people are smarter than a 5th grader which both our countries lack and the bullshit will be called off regarding what caused it. Both our governments are friends in the background and know each other's tastebuds, but like any actor's job they have to act like enemies for profit.

In the UN, both our countries ranks horribly in terms of basic human issues and aspects. That's why this is what the government has to offer to us. Sell Patriotism and to create that a bloody game of Hate and Carnage. 

The lucky ones are those from both our countries are those people who quit and settled down in first world countries for better lives and they get to fuel hatred by means of spending money and few comments. Meanwhile they share drinks and bang chicks and laugh in those first world countries tell both of us how stupid we are to fall for this.

Us Indians always puts a poor man down under the Sewage to clean and remove poop and toxics without protection. And we talk about injustice and revenge? Please. Why does your army have a chokehold over the civilian government? Since last time we met Gloria Jeans's outlet came up dude. Do you live in a major city? Have you tried imagining what a mushroom cloud will look like? I live in Karachi and was thinking of what it would look like and if I would see it in the distance before it hits me. I don't want war. I don't want people to die. But it seems inevitable now. The nut cases have taken over the government and they will take us to war for their greed and pride. Maybe increased  tourism can help bring down the ignorance. This next  one is never going to happen thanks to terrorism  but linent Visa and property , land owning laws between the countries . This will decrease the partition hate because both countries feel something was taken away from them forever .



My 2 chwanis on why we hate each other

Pakistan: Army controls everything even elected govt . To maintain / justify this control they need masses in fear of attack from a  strong and evil enemy. 

India : when ever we have a major festival or celebration or any happy time there's always an terrorist attack .sometimes it's busted sometimes they are successful ,they chant Allah hu akhbar while killing civilians and the organization which claims the attack is always based/operating from inside Pakistan . Point blank - can Pak, military establishment/ISI or govt, live without Kashmir? If not then there's nothing to discuss, Pak's one point agenda has always been ""the piece of land"" - if they weren't so dishonest about it the bloodshed of last 7 decades could've been avoided. India will not & cannot give up on Kashmir, so that's the bottom line.

Lastly good morning (evening?) to you, in whichever part of the world you are atm. I think you should educate all your fellow citizens to not support terrorism and vote for a government that  doesnt support terrorism.  

I know many of you all are peace loving people,  but you people should also take a stand against your government [removed]",2019-02-27 18:36:43

Just curious, why did you get married so late (by Indian standards)? Were you apprehensive initially? If so, why? And how is your everyday life different now?

PS: I'm hitting 32 this year and I have very little interest in getting married.  When you were a kid, were you open to arranged marriages?

If no, when did your perspective change? If no, do you feel like you compromised your ideals in order to find someone?

If yes, were you scared about letting the other person down due to un-communicated expectations either of you might have from the other? If yes, are you scared of ever finding or running into someone now whom you might consider ""your perfect match"", but now ofcourse you cant do anything since you're in an arranged marriage Blink twice if you're being made to do this against your will  Malayali? chaliye naye couple ko vannakum.! How did you prepare for this marriage. I'm not talking about the wedding ceremony or the financial stuff. I'm talking the personal stuff. How did you two meet and how long did you know each other or learnt about one another before you put a ring on her?

Did you feel the time spent together to know each other was enough to make the decision to spend a lifetime together? Congratulations :) Changes in yourself before and after marriage?  Have you had Sax yet? If so, who initiated it? Was it awkward?  keyword: recently Nice to see a Christian bride in saree, we still follow that in my Marathi Christian community. But the younger generation is more enamoured with dresses nowadays. You are in honeymoon phase. Well duh !

Everyone's happy at this stage. Come back after a few years & after kids... Is that Modi infront of you?  Posts a recently-married AMA. Avoids all sex related questions. You could have just hosted the AMA on Quora man! welcome to the honeymoon period my friend.. you'll soon discover why its called the honeymoo period lol Please don't post your personal problems here OP Congratulations. Happy for you brother :) did ur gharwala sing rukmani rukmani song the first night? did u see anyone of them dekhing from the khidki? Tell the wedding story in detail.

From how they found him to the wedding ceremony.  [deleted] Nothing to Ask. Fantastic pic.  [deleted] Malayali 

CSI or Evangelical? The key word is ""recently"". We facebook now boys  Congratulations :)

Read your comment about discovering each other.

Did any of her past bother or made you worry? If yes how did you react?  Congrats on the sex The truest test of marriage is when you rip the first fart. If she stays with you after, she's a keeper! OP is so fucking lame all he's done in this AMA is post 'thanks bro'  Give it some time and you‚Äôll get bored. This happens when a virgin guy gets a girl.  Congratulations to you and bhabhi ko bhi congratulations bol dena friend :) congrats man  Congratulations mate 
Happy married life! [deleted] Congratulations man.. ‚úåÔ∏è Good to know.

Good luck for you & your wife. Did you ask about her past? Haha good for you man, You're picture looks like a movie shot of a Maniratnam film. Congratulations!  Congrats fellow redditor Is that modi in the left side. So, what are the best memories of married life so far? What was in your mind when you saw him first time. And how did you know that he is one for you. Congrats. Never been happier? A certificate from the government for your affair is the happiest moment of your life?  So how's ghapa ghap.
Jk enjoy and congrats Good for you. GFY. üòÄ Bhai wish you all the best...2 years baad update dena mat bhulna. This guy finally got his aache din.  god bless, my stranger friend. Malayalee anno? Allathepinne. Congrats alliya!! Why did you mention AMA if you won't answer anything. Should have titled AMAA (ask me almost anything) next time Congratulations. It will take a little time to establish strong bond in an arranged marriage but just have a positive attitude and everything will be just fine. All the best. May God bless you with happiness in your life. Congrats OP. How long have you been married. Id like to hear from you after you have been married for atleast 3-4 years.  Lol. You Grow Up and learn the meaning of AMA. Probably posted this thread out of pure excitement and/or weird flex. Congratulations macha, Ellam nannayi nadakkatte. Bless you both. Congratulations! Enjoy the ride. congrats on the sex. Did you get a pre-nup or something?

Note this is just an announcement, the actual AMA will be posted at the earlier date and time. Please direct your questions to that thread.",doc_two_thirty," how do you guys get access to him? whom did you approach? what did you guys thinking when you started making this documentary? mod ask this question for me ii might just forget I was following it since it was first called ' preposition for a revolution' , but it was never going to be released in J&K. So a warm thanks for putting it for free on YouTube.  It was a great film, but you could tell their access stopped once kejriwal became CM. However, as a viewer, that's the point I really wanted to get an inside look into AAP - it was after coming to power that they lost a few of their morals, and started kicking out smart people like Yogendra.

Everything they covered till that point is sort of, in the public domain. We already knew that stuff - the film just gave a more human look at things. I hope they aren't selective in choosing which questions to answer What's your perception on Kejriwal base on your 1-1 interaction with him during the shoot? How different he really is than what is portrayed by the media? AAP died once Yogendra left. Thanks Mods for arranging this, I can't thank you guys enough for this!

/u/doc_two_thiry can you please include this in your post?

Full movie, everyone should watch this-

And their interview with VICE - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc22xwvaXV8 You have made the film out of 400 hours recording. Can we expect that you will release some more short videos  [deleted] This is a good & a promising one. Will get to know a lot of inside details.  Nice! I'm interested to know how they managed to cover the whole thing from up-close and facing Indian Govt censoring and other shit.  Great..hope the AMA gets conducted on Friday/Saturday. Why the frequency of making movies by your team is really slow? How are you still alive?

Or are you out of the country already?

AMA,[NP] Armab Goswami AMA discussion thread,263,67uw22,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67uw22/np_armab_goswami_ama_discussion_thread/,331,"IMO, it's a disappointment. ",Thisisbhusha," > it's a disappointment

Understatement . He did not answer a single question properly.  I wasn't surprised how it went. People who are so used to scripted interviews can barely make good of AMAs. I am not a big tv watcher. So far I thought Arnab is that guy who just shouts on TV but atleast he seems to be a guy with strong moral values and guts to speak his mind.

Reading that AMA I felt the complete opposite. He came across like that soft spoken neighbour hood aunty that won't stop nagging  you until you eat her ""worlds best sambhar"". Also how she avoids every other question yet somehow manage to mention about her sambar in every line.  Has anyone compiled a list of the 'pearls of wisdom' given to us by Arnab?

Like:

['Freedom for a reporter is in his mind.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgte6gk/)

['There can never be enough nationalism. More the better.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdmwg/)

['All Indians should be pro military and pro India. If that makes us right wing, then so be it.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdkim/)

Edit: ['There is no political positioning. There is right and wrong. Im for the right. Those who win in grey waters are confused or dishonest.'](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67us0c/this_is_arnab_goswami_i_am_here_as_promised_ask/dgtdpau/) Well He is a performance artist for me now on. My takeaway: It is easy to ask tough questions to people and very difficult to answer them.

That's clear from the answers of a person who made a career out of asking tough questions. /u/thatscoopquestion

4 hour old account, posted (at the time of writing) 3 soft, simple questions, Arnab answered them all in succession. Am I being paranoid? Seemed like he hired someone off internshala to do the AMA on his behalf and just gave them the direction ""REPUBLIC IS THE BEST AND UNBIASED. K? BYE.""
 A man who claims to do hard hitting journalism cant handle straight questions . I don't think he is quite sharp . He said to an answer that everyone shall be pro-military - that something you expect from an 19 year old who hasn't read much history or politics .

I like army as an institution but am i pro-military nopes that looks like a path to blindness to me    Cringefest Just like Newshour was. It was an enormous disappointment. This AMA was billed as a big ticket event. Ended up being a damp squib. Sudarshan News ceo ka bhi Ama karwa do lage haath. Coming soon on Republic TV: üî• Brave Arnab goes and talks directly to the anti-nationals at r/india. Republic Exclusive! üî•

The AMA was pathetic. Pretty much validates everything I though about him. I guess somewhere Wire.in guys would be jerking off to this AMA. It was a total mess. Its a fucking disgrace. Also, the mods should differentiate between and AMA and an AMAA. Publicity AMAs should be treated as advertisements. I think Arnab hates intellectuals because he probably wouldn't have a leg to stand on if he ever got scrutinized. Also, did he passive aggressively threaten the former fan with the long question?


""See you soon"" he said Well Shit! The replies read less like an Oxford-educated, supposed hard-hitting journalist  
and more like a right-wing BJP shill who's here to peddle his wares... I feel cheated.  ALmost every question had the answer as a variation of this line: ""We will launch REPUBLIC soon, cant wait to be back on tv"". He is the probably the most unethical mainstream journalist we have and he is going to get unrestricted editorial range in the new channel.  

He has his own definition of free of speech. Still spouting lies about the JNU students. Dimesses foreign press and activists. Is ok with using human shields and a host of other morally indefensible beliefs.   

No matter how much this AMA will look like we've flanked him, no amount of ad-hominem he got is enough. Once he gets cameras pointed at him, the kangaroo courts he will telecast live will do more damage to our sanity than r/india can ever do. We'll be left in disbelief at a number of insane things he'll spout and only be cleaning up after. 

Fuck that guy. 

 [deleted] https://m.imgur.com/GR1bRMU
What is according to you the best  moment from AMA?? At least he answered mine.But none of them were to the point, missing the point by a wide swath. I guess it was a deliberate tactic to move away from anything that might affect his pro bjp leanings .  It's a complete trainwreck. I hope he lost a few viewers today, and that would be quite fitting, if he carries on with his channel with the same attitude. If he changes, I'm all ears. I hope theWire.in or others write about this poor AMA. That will trigger Arnab Priyanka Chopra AMA > Arnab Goswami AMA Worse than I expected, he didn't even put on a facade of trying to have a sincere discussion. 


Just publicized his channel and gave some flippant  responses to detailed questions.  Clearly the esteemed journalist was here to promote the new republic channel .Got roasted on Reddit but I am afraid most of the people will fall for the prey outside reddit. Even I thought his channel will be better. Now I won't watch any shit from it.  Poora timewaste tha like his newshour -_- [I said that first](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/67h0uz/announcement_ama_with_arnab_goswami_on_27th_april/dgqf5sb/)

I knew this good for nothing sneaky bastard will do as predicted. The way the AMA looks right now, it is quite weird. The critical questions, which have the highest number of upvotes, are nowhere close to the top. 

The questions at the top are softballs. I guess that ranking is getting manipulated by the PR team as well.  R/india never forgets . Arnab shouldn't have done the AMA , he will now become the ""door knob"" of r/india :) Advertisement kar gya bahen chod. He can't shut mic here.  Holy shit...I felt sorry for this shit when I learned he was abruptly fired, but now after the AMA I wish Times had decimated him... Appalled by the below reply from a Journalist of his stature. I want it to be debated. 

> I feel the army and paramilitary needs to be given greater powers in Kashmir

My view: 
Appalled that it comes from a journalist. So should there be a systemic eradication of seperatists or whom the Army and the state think to be a threat? There was only 7% turn-out in the recently concluded by-elections in J&K. Let's say these 7% are true nationalists, On this basis I would go ahead and assume(based on past turn-outs) 20% would like to vote and would therefore want to be associated with India but because of fear they did not. This still keeps out 73%, Who you Sir want to be killed, raped and be subjected to severe torcher because the state and the army ""thinks"" to be a threat to the sovernieghty of the country. Clearly you have a bias even if you do not want to proclaim it out in the open. PSA to make it easier to read sort by q&a He was drunk I think. There was no difference between vocab of Donald Trump and his'. I asked how will you expand republic's coverage to global level, he answered ""we will use digital + technology"".

His other answers also were like they were being typed by trump. Lacked any depth whatsoever. These statements he made here in written maybe didn't look as good as they would've on TV coming out of his mouth filled with anger. Anyway this article in caravan mag correctly described he hates facts. He runs his media empire all on emotions. All his statements like ""everyone needs to be pro india"" ""no amount of nationalism is enough in a person"" were an attempt to speak to our patriotic emotions. But he wasn't aware, it worked on times now for years but reddit isn't as gullible as an average Times Now viewers.

In his mind during AMA he must be like ""i'm nailing this AMA as I'm speaking in favour of our kulcha and kountry and army"" just as Rahul Gandhi was feeling during his interview with arnab ""I'm nailing it as i'm speaking about women empowerment, RTI and candidate selection"". He got the taste of his own medicine today.

I can't believe people thought he was so rad and a ""fearless journalist"". He din't show a single quality of a journalist today. Our reddit trolls are better than him on an average. I'm happy about this AMA, he must be feeling where he stands now. I don't know if Arnab ever looked at the r/india community before agreeing to the AMA. From the questions to his responses I always knew it would probably end up like this. Celebrities come here expecting to simply have a chat with fans and face hard-hitting questions they would never expect to answer in a public forum.

Ultimately as an AMA... It wasn't much. I doubt it will have a net effect in his channel's visibility considering how niche this subreddit really is.

BTW, how did we score someone like Arnab for an AMA in the first place, /u/_dexter? Did you guys reach out to him and convince him or did he contact you? he is a  desperate for any publicity  Is it over?  ye sab moh maya hai Was that even him? Did he post any picture as a proof before the AMA? My thoughts on this AMA : 'Rampart' So. Much. Bhakti.  Arnab, we know you are lurking here and reading these comments, 

Your AMA is how should you roast your guest in lower case letters, you don't need to raise your volume for it. For a while i thought it was a Roast rather than an AMA When there will be riots in India, Arnab - the asshole that he is, will demand answers from NGO's who are helping in the relief process.

From reading his answers, it is clear that man will support genocide, dictatorship and slavery - come what may, in the guise of pseudo-nationalism. Fucking cunt. I guessed it would be bad but not this bad. 

He avoided tough questions, barely answered in more that a couple of lines, and he actually said 'We need more nationalism'  Can we have NaMo for an AMA soon given his love for attention ? This time he like one of the politicians in his show and randia is like Arnub himself.
No right questions answered but kinda completed AMA INDIA WANTS TO KNOW
 IMO, It was tatti. Ghanghor tatti.  I called it **R/India's Rampart** 

**#Arnabdodges** This AMA shows that people have no honest motivation and be truthful and discuss ideas, both which go with them or against them. People think they are celebrity and should be put on a pedestal. This in my opinion is what holds our country back! Not enough honest discussion, obviously except on r/india Freedom for a reporter is in his mind !
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcdHul2F8Rs

I don't think he was here to answer any questions , he was just looking for some cheap PR for his channel but was bamboozled by r/india NATIONAL TREASURE^^TM I think his actual persona and media persona are two different things. But he knows what to sell as what matters these days is the bottomline I am reminded about this book now :http://www.sup.org/img/covers/med_large/pid_23082.jpg

The main point is your nation's IQ is more important than yours and people like Arnab are using it that to the fullest  Looking at his answers, he's the polar opposite of what he appears to be on TV (I'm assuming that none of his team members had a role in the AMA).

Most of his views were downright atrocious.

'Freedom for a reporter is in his mind.'

'There can never be enough nationalism. More the better.'

'All Indians should be pro military and pro India. If that makes us right wing, then so be it.'

Yeah, bitch.
 What did we expect? Reasonable discussion or answers from a BJP guy?  Guys you are taking this too seriously.

for him reddit is just another site to advertise. he does not take ama/reddit as seriously as other people take or people here take. probably the same way you dont care much what people say on FB/twitter

 Remember this is a publicity AMA for his new channel launch more than an actual AMA. Having said that, he is quite unabashed about his ideology and not really taking the bait... most of the really good questions are asked in his replies and he is not looking at them.

Even his answers to the controversial or hard hitting question are one line answers.... ""I love India"" kind of answers, you can't really argue with that.

But he is standing his ground, you got to give him that. What the fuck ? The answers didn't even read like it was Arnab. Is his TV personality that different ? Fuking retarded AMA if someone else did it for him. I wonder if he is going to have a discussion about this AMA on Republic  Somehow he chose his questions. I don't think AMA from arnab should be like that. It's called Ask me Anything for a reason  [The Arnab Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mswb4eT-kXg0) Arnab Giswami destroyed the meaning of unbiased journalism today. I was very excited for this AMA but it was a disappointment. This AMA was r/amadisasters material.  Shitty AMA. Glad I missed it.  Was it Arnab? Did the mod verify him? Sounded like a troll. So many mods and no proof pics? Mods get your shit together Hmmmm GODDAMNIT.

Whats the point of being subscribed to this timesink for 2 years if I miss an ARNAB ama?

I feel like such an antinashnul :/ Arnab Goswami is the Indian Alex Jones. Seriously. I wish someone had asked him why he was so soft with Modi. How does it feel to be dedicated liblords outraged about being dominated by autists, amateurs and low iq right wingers first in politics, then on media and now right here on your professional shitposting turf? You guys are so pathetic The problem is with those who expected anything more than PR bluff from him.

To me, he is no more than an ignorant BJP ass licker.

Atleast Congress has/had some smart Pro-Congress journalists  I was looking forward to a concise but meaningful AMA. I mean the guy is on TV for a long time and well informed than most of us. :-/ Anti nationals will be nationalized once republic TV airs 

Edit:  /s  There was no verification post so how can people even believe that it was him? [deleted] But it's what randia deserves. People saying he is dumb etc. on this AMA he can always proxy someone else or do google and answer. on TV he has to be interactive.",2017-04-28 00:35:32
AMA,"Hi, I‚Äôm Swati - CoFounder of CashKaro.com - Ask Me Anything about Entrepreneurship, Cashback model/industry & more!",101,6rk5x5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6rk5x5/hi_im_swati_cofounder_of_cashkarocom_ask_me/,214,Verification: http://imgur.com/Hw8aplH,Swati_CK," This idea of coupons is still a thing people stay away from (atleast from third party sites), don't know about your site or how it works but according to the AMA announcement thread, people actually think this as a very non legit (even though it may be),
how do you make people aware of the business model and its legitness?

Also, the idea of all of this is okay, but its still gonna be very limited even at its peak, not sure but many entrepreneurs just grab the invested money, make bucks and leave since many if not all start ups don't have a money making model that can be incorporated, comments on this??


lastly how do you make money? if tomorrow all of the retailers you take coupons from start handling out their own cash backs and make up a system similar to yours wouldn't it take your firm out on this? Hey Swati, loving the attitude, you did walk in to an AMA which could've been all guns on you, you did excellent.

As a two time startup guy who managed to get acquired (fairly happy) both the times - touchwood-, I'd like to know where do you see CK going? A possible exit by acquisition? 

Additionally, what drives bigger business motifs for you - niche ecommerce or mass multi vendor? 

I was also consulting one of the biggest coupons startups a few years back, and thought they would be far bigger now - but they couldn't innovate at the rate at which they should have (still one of the biggest..hint hint..elephant :P ), lack of innovation and burning to build a quasi loyalty program does end up draining most of the money out of the system for some players in the similar space. 

r/India doing me a prod as well by maintaining decorum.  This feels like a good AMA by reading all the answers. So how's your normal day like Swati?  Yes, I have read them. Both Amazon and Flipkart are well aware of our business model.. we work with their teams directly and in fact they tell us about all their upcoming promotions in advance, even buy extra advertisement space. They don't like us giving Cashback as real cash hence, you will see on CashKaro that we offer CashKaro Rewards for Amazon and Flipkart shooping - these can be withdrawn as Amazon/Flipkart Gift Vouchers rather than NEFT transfer. So there is no issue really.. they may not work with every Cashback site but they do work with us in a legitimate manner. 

https://cashkaro.com/stores/flipkart
https://cashkaro.com/stores/amazon (in fact Amazon informs us every month which categories are allowed for Cashback - these change every month)  
Total staff strength? Why should someone use CashKaro and not other Cashback websites? (Other websites have better UI and similar offers IMO) On a scale of KRK to SRK this is Tiger Shroff üòÇ Do you sell customer data? Isn't cashback industry too dependent on online retailers? What if tomorrow Flipkart and Amazon starts to provide cashback directly to consumers like Paytm? Do you think they don't already do so because it is not a profitable business practice? In the AMA announcement there was a comment which suggested that CashKaro had not followed through on the rebate for the person. How often does this happen? Do you track this as the CEO? What are you doing to prevent it?

Looking at your Facebook page, the top 2-3 reviews are from former interns or current employees. Are you comfortable with what that insinuates about your business? Hi swati , thanks for doing AMA

Do you think little app is your competitor? Its catching up these days in restaurant , saloon deals. This turned out better than I thought. How do you compete against credit cards giving cashback? I just purchased a phone on Amazon and HDFC bank gave me 2k as cash back [deleted] Little late to the party. But here's my grievance. I signed up in 2015, shopped for over 70k through Cashkaro, never got a single penny. Filed a complaint, no reply, reminder sent, no reply. Fuck Cashkaro. I now ask people to not use this website CashCrow. Game of Coupons. Bunch of Out of Control Crow Coupons luring White Walkers (customers).  Nice handwriting [removed] What are your thoughts on r/India community ? Or is this the first time you're using Reddit? why are u doing this AMA?  You don't seem to have an android app. Can we infer from this that most of your target customers purchase using a laptop and not via smartphones?

On a similar note, what did you think of flipkart's app-only trial. As a member of senior management of a tech company, would you tell me the importance of grades while hiring freshers and experienced people? [deleted] Glad I read this. Maybe will try it out. All credit to you for doing a AMA. Hoping more founders will follow suite. Hi Swati. Your website design can be a lot more better. And what's the deal with ad on the left? All the best.  Wow you're still answering the questions. You're great Swati. :) Where do you get the coupons from? On a scale of Arnab Goswami to Shashi Tharoor, I'll rate this AMA as Arvind Kejriwal. Why do cashbacks get denied almost half the time? [deleted] Looks like the party is over. But, in case if u r reading, I would like to know whether CashKaro has any plan to integrate bitcoin in the system? An example application is https://purse.io, but they dont work for Indian eCommerce sites. So, probably an untapped market for Indian CashBack site like CashKaro, especially when we are witnessing minister's interest in Bitcoin - https://twitter.com/PriyankKharge/status/888955190505750528 Your suggestions for a 21 year old? Liked the AMA. Good job, Swati. All the best.

Edit: I do have a few questions.

1. Could you tell us about your experience at Goldman Sachs?  

2. What competitive advantage does Gurgaon provide? (In comparison with, let's say, Bengaluru).

3. What's your favourite book?   Have you ever thought about introducing a chrome extension which reminds people to purchase it through cashkaro whenever they are going to buy something from Amazon or others? How did you get Ratan Tata to invest in Cashkaro? What are his views on the future of the firm? How did you get Kalari capital to invest in cashkaro? How long do you think a site like CashKaro.com would survive? Do you think this is profitable? If yes, what gives CashKaro.com a competitive advantage i.e. how long would it take someone else to build a similar product like CashKaro.com? I myself want to be an Entrepreneur, what are the steps to get there? Any shortcuts?
 What is your advice for young students?  Pouring Pounds is similar to CashKaro?  Hi, could you tell us about how you started the firm? The setbacks and how you sustain it, Thank you. What's the plan with Mr. Tata on board.. new fundings or you gonna get him to do an ad for you..?

No on a serious note what's the direction of the company now that ecommerce is consolidating?  What do you want to say to your customers about the future of Cashkaro? you still here? what's your company turnover? I can see why a *""6.78%, 20.3% 'cashback', rewards, payment""* etc can get complicated  for average Indian customers, afterall the market is dominated by CoD orders. For this business to go mainstream, things need to get simplified. 

As you said most of the visits are from desktop users says what big chunk of customers you're missing out on, considering top e-commerces get most visitors from mobile platform. An app should be the next big thing.

 *Suggestions.* When customers search for a product on your site instead of say on Amazon, Amazon would miss out on all the customer search data (which I think is very valuable - to Amazon) , how are you thinking of sharing search data about customers with retailers? Or will you try to monetize that data? ;) Any plans of offering coupons for cryptocurrency?  I am a big proponent of the affiliate cashback system and have several questions. Hope you find the time to answer them! Welcome to Reddit btw.

**1**: Who would you say is your fiercest competitor right now? 

I've been a longtime user of GoPaisa although TopCashBack seems to be giving the highest rates in the industry right now.

**2**: Do you feel the need to differentiate in a saturated market?

I would definitely consider CashKaro if it was THE place on the internet for comprehensive and meticulously maintained coupon code page, apart from cashback. I think Grabon has the lead in that segment.

**3**: Why is there no cashback for eBay?

**4**: Is the 250 bucks minimum payout ideal if you want to drive adoption and retention? GP and TCB have 150 and 0 Rs minimum.
 Hi Swati! Hope I haven't missed you. Thanks for doing the AMA. The announcement post got very critical and your AMA has cleared many misconceptions. I have never used any cashback sites before but will definitely have a look at CashKaro from now on.   

My question to you is - Do you think people who have great academic background (Top MBAs and decent work ex) are less prone to failures compared to people jumping into startups right after colleges? Also do you have any advice for new age entrepreneurs who feel almost every market/niche is tapped and that new ideas/products are a great disadvantage given the competition.   What tech stack is used for CashKaro.com? Hi; How this model is different from Affiliated Marketing ?? Hey Swati, I don't have any questions but just want to thank you on a patient and positive AMA. Good luck with Cashkaro. what advice would you give to an undergrad who wants to do something in agriculture sector Probably a stupid question. But, by any chance, would FK / Amazon etc. charge more if we come through your website? As opposed to the normal route of buying through them only instead? Don't you think that your business model has a very limited growth opportunity and lifespan?

Your model is based on generating affiliate income from e-tailers like flipkart, etc. and offering a cash-back as incentive to the people whom you refer. As you start to grow, don't you think that some of these retailers will think of bypassing you and start giving these offers directly to customers?

There is also the question of profitability. In a competition market, traders hardly earn a 10% margin on FMCG, how much can they afford to give as affiliate commission? On top of that, if you start giving cash-backs, there will hardly be anything left to keep for yourself? We are talking about 10% of 10% of 10%, really! I often get bored at my workplace when given same type of work. If someone of your employee feel bored at workplace and come tell you, what would you say or do? 
I am a fresh graduate.  Wow, great job Swati!

Kudos for being so chill! I want to establish an online shop as an online entrepreneur.To establish this what are the common steps I need to follow to set up my business primarily? Any suggestion or tips?
Thanks One interesting question. What's the way to get into London School of Economics. 
What are their expectations. And how much of economics background does someone need before applying? 

TYIA  As a kid I wanted to study Economics, but got pushed into studying science by parents. I leave for the US to study for Master's in Electrical Engineering after 10 days.

What should I do if I want to study Economics by I am thirty? I am 22, and I think I am good at Math. WoW. Great AMA. Dint hear about CashKaro before. Learnt about it today. Amazing concept.

/u/Swati_Ck If u r still reading this thread, I'd like to know if u'll be interested to place ad on an India focused mock test portal, i.e. education domain? Heard that you got to study abroad via scholarships.. How can one become eligible for that? Also any advises for youngsters in general?

That way Arnab could interrupt before you're done here too!  Let's all do this AMA in CAPS! ok? This is the baap of all AMAs! 

R/India is a pretty tough crowd too for Arnab given how much he was criticized for letting people down in the Modi interview. Let's see if he comes up with justifications for all that. This is gonna be fun. The man who proved that a news debate can be conducted with 32 panelists with 8 of them talking simultaneously out of the grid of 16 who are shown on screen at the same time which also includes 4 empty chairs. One of the fallouts of this move is a lot more  Indians discovering reddit. 

I was in love with Quora before the great Indian horde took over and destroyed the site. Sigh. 

Shit posters, trolls and 17 year old life advisors - reddit is not a good place, please stay away. 

 [deleted] r/India wants to know. Damn khoo. Kickass this will be.  Will Arnab answer #whatthenationwantstoknow?  Scenes when Arnab tells randia to shut down.  So finally all of India, WILL KNOW Fastway Cable is already showing Repubic Channel and a long interview ad of Gau-Swami is airing. I don't know why comments criticizing him are getting downvoted.
His first response to Sukma attack was ""Kanhaiya Kumar & Azaadi Brigade"".
When did questioning an Idiot Student leader become a brave thing?
Who the fuck is Kanhaiya Kumar and Why isn't he getting arrested if everyone believes that he is a terrorist sympathizer?
 Iski to mil kar lenge Nice. Next we should get Subramanian Swamy here. Will this be another disappointment like the previous much awaited Shashi Tharoor AMA ? more like block @redditindia Remind me 43 hours  This is gonna be juicy.  I doubt if he's already there in r/india.  Can we have a list of compulsary questions for him to answer before he can go on to answer softball promotional questions about his new venture? Why is he looking like Ravi Kishen? Will he be alone or will he come bundled along with Mahroof Raza ?  How will he shout here ? Type in ALLCAPS ?  Type in **bold** ? Or **BOTH** ?    aao bahen ke lund.  Does the nation want to know? #NATION WANTS TO KNOW, ARE YOU GOING TO BE TRULY IMPARTIAL IN YOUR JOURNALISM, OR GIVE WAY TO THE LATEST ARKNOB ON THE BLOCK, NEWS18'S FEROCIOUS ZAKKA JACOB Randia wants to know!  Will Arnab interrupt us or we will interrupt Arnab. Oh wow. What a catch! I think this AMA is going to be one for the ages. This here is shit and that is the fan... you know what to do. https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C9R4aGiXsAATLaI.jpg:large There is nothing special or innovative about launching an Indian version of Brietbart especially at a time when the party/ideology you support is decimating everything else. At least Brietbart did it when it was uncool Fuck yeah!!! Arnub is going to regret this  Really, Excited to hear about the Republic.. :) So what questions are off the table? Here it goes, he's gonna dodge all tough and high stake questions. You are welcome At least India finally has a news outlet that isn't obsessed with the INC. People on Twitter are asking for AMA videos to be uploaded on YouTube . Reddit is so popular! i want to ask when did he sell the soul to the bjp? This might as well be one of the most important AMAs in history of /r/India.

‡§Ö‡§¨ ‡§Æ‡§ú‡§º‡§æ ‡§Ü‡§è‡§ó‡§æ... Remindme! 18 hours bring your phone to tuition No please. It will lead to arrival of innumerable number of *bhakts* on reddit.  I don't know about others but i for one am sure that i don't want reddit ama with arnab. After him other scumbags and journalist will start getting a an ama slot here and then more rigid moderation won't be far away. Remindme! 1 day  I genuinely don't know who he actually is, I vaguely remember him from a comedy sketch ""India wants to know"". Would appreciate some ELI5. So is he gonna reply in all caps? ab aayega maza . Hope he doesn't be all politically correct and answer nicely. The guy who defined my view of Rahul Gandhi without pandering to  the powerful Aaja Arnab the BJP sellout :)  It would have been nice if he did an AMA when he was not aligned with any political ideology and used to ask really tough questions to all parties on behalf of Dineshan. I want to know how often he sucks the Government's dick  Careful randia. Do not criticise the Army during the AMA.

Edit 2: After contact with the mods, they have said that there is no manner this post can be verified. Well, very well.

Edit 3:

#End of AMA!

You guys have been amazingly fun to converse with, and I thoroughly enjoyed this. I'll be an active participant in r/India and I hope to participate in the daily discussions too! Thank you, y'all!",IndianDaddy," How do u perform if u are not attracted to a particular client ?  Is it usually cover the face and fire the base ? How pp so big saar? Is it expected that a gigolo has model-like looks and sculpted physique? Are you getting business because of your looks/body? From which area most of your clients are? 

What exactly are these hen parties?

Do you pay taxes? 

What are the chances for not so good looking guy? 

I have heard gym trainers can get into this line easily. Is it true?

Do most people in Mumbai provide or take escort services?

Are you Indian?

Is this post part of your promotion strategy? Ye to asli Rocco hai.. wo eco grad tha from lse, iirc Hi. I have few questions. Few may arise later too. Thanks for the AMA. 

1. Have you ever considered going for gay parties? Even if the pay was high.

2. What are government rules that one gigolo should be aware of one's safety if any situation arises with the police? And any personal rules too would work.

3. Any experience of Orgies?

4. You said that ""...nobody lies as much as porn"". What do you think can the porn do to better the viewer experience more realistic?

5. Do you get worried about STD's? Also, how many times 
a month do you go to Doctor?  I wasn't even aware this was a scene in India.

1. How did you become a professional gigolo? 
2. How do women hire you?
3. Is it fun at the parties as they show in porn? Or is there too much pressure? u/wannabeGigolo *Humko kehte Superman.... On Kar lo handycam...* Did you ever get caught? Does this effect your relationship? Do you mark out quick exit points, in case the husband/boyfriend arrives?  All i want to say is ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) *Nice* How much do you charge for 1 bob? 1. What exactly do you mean *boytoy*? What are those stripper parties like?

2. Have you even been physically / mentally abused? Do you any form of protection from the same? (Like being part of some group or something) How often do you suggest ideas/improvise etc about a session and how often do you partake in predefined activities only as suggested by clients?

Any role playing idea you‚Äôd love to pitch in a clients head that you‚Äôre excited about? 

Do all your clients establish consent before they randomly try something new with you or do you have some set boundaries or are you mostly flexible in your realm? What are some of the prejudices you encounter ? And how could I evade such prejudices, when talking to a friend who's in a similar line of work? How's your mental health?

Has your perception of women changed since you heh, entered the field?

If you were to give a few pointers towards sex-ed for the younger folks (not explicit stuff rather as in consent and boundaries etc) what would you have to say? 
1. Is it circumcised? What do women prefer?
2. Is it naturally 8.5 are did you use anything to increase the length?
3. What things in diet should one avoid to have a great stamina during sex? Have you been emotionally involved with them? 
Have you ever been blackmailed by them ?
 1. Do you have a girlfriend? If you do, does she know about your this line of work?

2. Do you intend to stop after some time? Let's say, like a financial goal or a relationship goal?

3. How did you meet the first lady who helped you out with the rest of the clients?

4. Have you met any of them outside of the sex in public? What was it like? Have any clients ever made non-sexual demands? Like cuddling, talking, friendship etc? How have you dealt with it? Noice. 

Reference milega kya bro? How can I pass my engineering exams ? Have you denied clients? Why? 

Do you own costumes / any special items? Jesus dude. Econ grad who does work for think tanks doing this on the side? 

Have you considered applying for scholarships/PhD overseas? That might actually help you get out of here and do something more meaningful. You seem like a bright chap and if you found yourself doing this, you sure are helluva creative problem-solver. I'm sure you can figure something out instead of doing this, as much fun as it might be, isn‚Äôt the best use of your education/potential. 

PS - Not judging/hating. If you enjoy it and that's what you want to do, for sure keep doing it. All your answers seem too generic to be believable unless you can verify. Don't have a question, just want to to tell you to stay safe. How do u keep a room full of strangers engaged? Do u get to the act straight away or?  What all activities do you involve in? Can you elaborate on that? According to you what causes immense pleasure for a woman? Is it penetrative sex? Favourite experience?

How much anal?

 [deleted] You say you charge 4k to 7k. Why haven't you charged more? I'm amused cos upper middle classish people spend more that on a night out drinking and you're offering them an experience. If you're gonna go out and do something risky why not up the charge? Say 15k? Have you given this a thought? What am I missing here? 5 to 7k seems low AF. Mind you, I'm completely unaware of the money dynamic in this scenario. Also do you optimise clients/sessions for money per hour made or fun per hour had? 

Thanks and Good luck. * You sound really smart and eloquent. If you don't mind me asking, how was your life so far in socioeconomic terms? You've mentioned that you work hard on your physical appeal, but how much of your attractiveness do you think comes from your mind? 

* Would someone who is maybe as attractive physically but not so impressive mentally still be as popular? how much infedility you noticed in this line of work? i mean does every other rich women/girls use sevices like this? You‚Äôre pretty fair skinned right ? I have been quite curious and obsessed with this stock Nasdaq:ROKU . Even after great quarterly numbers and higher expectations next quarter, the stock took a nosedive and plunged by 25%.

My gut says it's just a Wall Street shake off by institutions trying to shake off all the dumb money before going long on this. But I'm also terrified because the next support could be  well below $35 and I may lose 33% of my investing capital.

Do you think it would be a good buy? I'm planning to get in at $43 and exit at $50 in 3-6 weeks. The 52 week high was at $70. Are any pimps involved? Usually a trade of this nature invariably has some element of organized crime involvement where they traffic people never let them leave the business. So is there something of this sort involved?  Ever had a threesome? 1. What's your workout routine like?

2. Is there a need to be fashion conscious or just suit and shoes work?

3. Any preference by clients on body hair? How does it feel to be a gigolo?  How long is your dick?. Do you do anal to or vice versa [deleted] The last sentence in edit 2 though üòÇ Econ Grad huh.. 
TN Srinivasan must be so proud from his grave. 1 .Worst experience ?
2.what are some wierd fetish requests you have received from women ?
 Tis a strage thread with a justified poster Guide me sir  Like someone asked what are the exit points u have planned incase of being caught by husband/boyfriend/police ?

Incase of sexual harrassment complaints against you, how are you going to defend yourself ?
 [deleted] What is the average age of your clients? Also what was the age of your youngest & oldest customer Tips for better dick health. What‚Äôs the yearly earning potential?

What‚Äôs the monthly expense? Include grooming, clothing, food, toys.

What‚Äôs the upper weight limit for this job?

Any grooming tips you‚Äôd like to share for ordinary guys who just want to go to work in an office and come back home. What app do you use to text your clients. WhatsApp or Telegram?

By having your number (assuming you use WhatsApp) aren't you primed for having your cover blown by a disgruntled client? What's your fitness routine? Height, weight, bicep size and do u even lift bro? What's the age of the oldest woman you have fucked ? A friend of mine told me about these hen parties she when too. But there were 3-4 guys. Are these parties anything like Dancing Bear, lol? I mean I know how wild they are in the west, but how wild are they in India? any famous or celebrity client? Best of luck for graduation. you doing great mate :) What is the age group of men that your clients generally seek? What does your diet look like? Do women especially the Bridge have sex with you at bachelorette parties?  Do you write @ ISS(Indian Sex Stories) ?
If not, start doing so.
 What were the kinkiest demands of your clients?  1. Have you been in any situation where they physically hurt you? 
If no, what would you do if you encounter such situation? 

2. What are the scene of cuckold in India? I have seen a huge number of cuck accounts in Tumblr. Most of them are paid couples. 

3. Would you recommend anyone else for this thing? Why? 

4. Do you think someone should get into this just to fulfill their fantasies/kinks?

5. Are most of your clients rich?

 I'm assuming your clients are mostly rich women. What is the age range, relationship status that your clients come from? Are they mostly married, unsatisfied women, as pop culture would have us believe? Or are there young women too?

What kind of demands do they place on you? Just sex? Or is emotional intimacy, companionship a part of the deal too? Hey good to here that you are doing great in the industry. I have tried to become one of you but the agents online are the scammers and i have been looted . They ask for pre meet money or membership fees.

I thought you may help me out by sharing something so i could aslo be like you .... Plz do reply!! Fake Title should be 'me trying to earn internet stranger's trust to get some desperate aunty pussy' posing as a 'professional gigolo' Tell us about the clients, are they physically gross. How often do you turn them down? Ever felt guilty or ashamed of yourself ? Do you feel uncomfortable facing mirrors sometimes ? 

No, I don't mean to humiliate you . Just asking about the guilt psychology. Do you think you would not need such meaningless extra jobs and would earn a decent living with NGO and think tank work if you were living in a Marxist Utopia? Why though? Can you show a full body pic of yous minus the face? I'm honestly curious to see how you look since this just seems a little too out of my imagination (I'm from a very sanskari family and an ugly women repellant so u r basically my opposite) PM me if you don't wanna post here How exactly did you end up in this situation? Why not take a regular job like BPO/KPO/ bank sales instead? I have links to real life Indian gigolo videos. I cannot post them since I am in office right now. Please remind me to post them in a few hours. How far people go to get attention from internet strangers. First of all what do you think of our country current economy like will it improve or will the currency still fall. Also another question I have might seem a bit desperate but I still got to ask. You see I am a guy with avg looks and same down there(5inches). You see being on the internet and talking to others has placed a lot of insecurities for me. But I still wanna know the truth. What are the chances if I get married that the would be wife will cheat on me due to lack of sexual satisfaction and can I do anything to change it. Or should I just see marriage as merely a contract and not be too much attached to her and keep an eye on the side for fun myself(not my favourite path since part of me still has this romantic idea of love and marriage,dumb I know but its who I am). Or is it better I remain single? Sorry to ask such a question man but if possible give me a truthful answer. I dont mind even if it is a painful one as a painful truth is better than any sweet lie.",2018-11-14 22:50:02

So we would love to know his thoughts on other topics which bollywood refuses to discuss such as nepotism, poor quality of movies being produced and many more things that randia would like to ask like how's life, universe and everything. So we'd love to have an AMA with Abhay Deol. Going by the way he posted on facebook this should be fun.

P.S.: If **Imran Khan** is viewing this post through his **alternate ID** then please please please call him and tell him that randia is calling. Thanks. :)",pikettier," I just want to know if Imran Khan is still lurking on randia. I just want to ask him what movie he was promoting when he started the whole thing about fairness creams.

Also, I loved Our Lucky Lucky Oye so much that I watch it every month. [deleted] I hope he remains Abhay during the AMA instead of chickening out and giving a Sunny picture of Bollywood. 

Also, Imran Khan didn't part on good terms with /r/India. The Vir Das ama he promised is still pending. 


**Edit**: Explanation for /u/nitrozipp3r, /u/Lurkingtwerker, /u/tintin_007, /u/USpolitics2017, /u/TheComingOfTheGeeks on Imran Khan and /r/India:

[Actor Imran Khan did an AMA here 3 years ago (Wow).](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/236bpy/hi_reddit_longtime_lurker_first_time_poster_imran/). Apparently he had been using Reddit India for a long time with an anonymous account that no one knew. People enjoyed his AMA and he put himself forward as someone who was different from other Bollywood people and was willing to criticize it. This earned him a lot of fans here and he started commenting regularly on his AMA account.

 His comments got a lot of attention and people were acting starstruck, commenting with awe on his every word. Eventually some people began to dislike him and call him a hypocrite e.g. posting pictures of him on set with a poor servant following him around with an umbrella etc. 


Around this time, Priyanka Chopra did an AMA on /r/IAMA. /r/India was mad because she paid money to have a road named after Her deceased father. There were some legitimate criticisms but also a lot of irrelevant and cruel comments. The AMA was a disaster. Imran Khan later said that he would ask Vir Das to do an AMA. He posts the screenshot of a text where he asks Vir Das to come over.

His account suddenly disappears after a few days. 

**The commonly accepted theory:** He voted on a linked thread. This is a reddit taboo and gets you banned. I disagree because there's no source for this claim. How would someone else know that he vote brigade? 


**What I think**: A guy asked him whether he will name a road after his newborn daughter like Priyanka Chopra did for her dead father. IMO this was the final straw for him from his growing number of critics here and he deleted his account.

He probably still comments here from an anonymous account but this is one of the great mysteries of /r/India. If anyone has more info on this, please comment. 

Also, it looks like I'm an /r/India veteran now. Damn.  I am going to message him on FB asking for an AMA. :) 1. Identify topic most vocal section of social media passionate about
2. Go with the bandwagon
3. Publicity. Good try Abhay Deol! [removed] AMA with him will be great. Good idea. Upvoting for visibility  One man does virtue signalling - and we MUST speak to him. Have you guys never heard of a public relations campaign?  What's Abhay Deol's opinion on stalking women ? People over here conveniently forget that he acted in a movie where the male protagonist stalks the heroine in order to woo her. Anyone remember Raanjhanaa ? Can someone ask him on my behalf how many movies he's acted in where he hasn't used any fairness-inducing agent? Get arjun rampal too for that matter",2017-04-16 15:15:02

Why did you decide to take up social work after spending your entire life working in the corporate sector? What flipped the switch?
2. Of all the social causes you could have taken up, why HIV prevention among sex workers?
3. Considering how taboo sex is in Indian culture, how were the reactions of your family and friends when you decided to work with sex workers? Hi. Congratulations on the success of Avahan!

My question is - 
Most of the problems plaguing the country at this point, be it education/public health/climate are systemic in nature. Successfully solving these problems, that too with a consulting toolkit can be a very hard task. For those of us who‚Äôre young, inexperienced and want to carry out such projects without deep knowledge of how tangled they are, what suggestions would you offer? 

Also, other than HIV, what according to you is the other big problems that we all should be working toward? Signing off for now!
Thanks for all those questions, and I'm on twitter at alexander_ashok.
If you have more questions ...well read the book :)

Bye Here is a recent [article](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/dec/13/the-untold-story-of-how-india-sex-workers-prevented-an-aids-epidemic-ashok-alexander-a-stranger-truth) in the Guardian about the journey what leadership havr you seen come up due to your efforts? My book is not so much about HIV and many of the  questions are ‚Ä¶
Its about the power of communities of the most marginalized women to solve huge problems..there's a revolution hidden in that

Its also about a personal journey, the adventure within us, waiting to be had...

its about another India, shocking and also inspiring we never see..

i'd welcome questions on those lines too... I‚Äôve heard from my friends who‚Äôre at MBBs that it‚Äôs not a cakewalk, you must have worked really hard to be there in the first place and to survive and grow as well. How challenging is it for a person like you to run an NGO like The Antara Foundation and work at the grassroots level in a sector like healthcare? What were the difficulties faced and what was/is the motivation to keep going? Hi Ashok, /u/struggle_r asked the following questions -- 

> Hi Ashok! First of all, a big Thank You. People like you who tirelessly work towards betterment of downtrodden and society at large are the real (unsung) heroes.
>     
> 1. What are your thoughts around BMGF hiring consulting cos for ""projects""?
>     
> 2. If you were given an opportunity to address one problem in Indian society, what would that be? Despite progress and change in social attitudes towards HIV/AIDS, there is yet a lot of stigma that surrounds this health issue. Based on your Avahan experience, what solution would you offer to break this taboo?  What's your view on the recent Trafficking Bill being introduced? Is there any truth in reports claiming that it might end up [targeting sex workers?](https://qz.com/india/1499242/indias-proposed-anti-trafficking-law-may-hurt-sex-workers/) Hi, thanks for taking out the time for doing this.

How would you rate the current situation that we as a country (and the healthcare sector) are at when it comes to tackling the societal aspect of the disease and the taboos associated with it? I believe there is a tremendous amount of work that PSM (preventive and social medicine) can do to make things even better especially when it comes to reaching out to the sex workers and providing them with better support.

Also are there any CSR projects that are looking into this? Hi Ashok, welcome to reddit! What is your experience working with public servants? Do they cooperate? Do they hinder progress? Did you have to work closely with governments?  Many people are not aware about PEP, how do you create awareness about that ? What are your thoughts on legalization of prostitution in our country? Do you think it would help tackle the situations regarding the welfare of sex workers ? [removed] [removed] You did this under the aegis of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

Note this is just an announcement, the actual AMA will be posted at the earlier date and time. Please direct your questions to that thread. 
",root_su," I wonder what they have to say about this comment by Arnab G:

>As for the Wire, please refer to the above and check the nationality of its editor.
 The good news is that it can't get any worse than Arnab's AMA. Can someone please ask these questions for me? I won't be free during the AMA.

1. Are you aware of the heavy tilt towards opinion/analysis pieces in The Wire's overall content mix? Do you plan to fix it, say with more reportage, or are you comfortable with staying in the analysis space?
2. Does The Wire plan to become financially self-sustaining at any point? How?
3. Why should someone read The Wire over Scroll or Firstpost or HuffPo or any of the others? Is there some differentiator you are aspiring towards? (I say aspiring because it isn't obvious to me that there is one at this point.)
4. For Siddharth V: I heard there was cheering and clapping in the hallways when you were sacked at The Hindu. What went wrong? Ohh wow, this is superb. Good job mods. Yes. Yes. Yes. I hope they try to answer all the quality questions unlike Arnab G.  This good, please bring Ranga uncle some time. Oh these are the founders of the wire. Now I understood  visible bias in their stories.  Dear mods, can you put a limit on the number of questions asked by a person. 
It just defeats the purpose of an AMA as it is for a short duration and you have people asking 5-7 questions in a single post.  Will they answer how their website is peddling fake news like this one: http://www.opindia.com/2017/05/how-fake-news-about-rss-linked-org-promising-fair-babies-was-invented-by-media/ Atleast We will get answers now.
And they will trigger so many people.

Nice work, mods! Finally some real journalists for AMA!

Edit: And please no toothpaste me namak ya gau-mutr like questions this time.BC Arnab ne apne AMA wahi ek question sahi answer kiya tha. What do you have to say about you being called Urban Naxalites? When you walk through the garden, you betta watch yo back! Shit Such a great chance for a AMA and I will be stuck in a bus after giving my MHCET.  Wasn't violation of r/india by Arnab enough? /s This will legitimately give this sub a boner. Expect rank hypocrisy and a complete reversal in attitude from the Arnab AMA. 

These two journos are as biased and intellectually mediocre as Arnab, but because their bias is hard left and virulently anti-BJP/RSS/'Brahminical hegemony'(The kind of nonsense terms The Wire was spewing after BJP won the UP elections defying their predictions) it matches the majority of posters here and therefore these two will be automatically regarded as the role models of 'neutral' Indian journalism. loved the show. Some one should ask M K Venu regarding his UP election analysis and predictions isn't SV from The Hindu group ? Let's please separate the government from the nation. Just because the Wire criticises the government does not mean they're criticising the ""nation"". Secondly, even if they decide to criticise the nation, they have every right to. That's what freedom is about. I've been reading the Wire since they launched and rather than criticise, they're doing some stellar journalism and touching upon areas such as science much better than literally every mainstream newspaper in India does. Looking forward to this AMA and it'll definitely be better than that exasperating farrago of ducking, weaving and dodging that Arnab's AMA was.

Do we have pilots here? Especially anyone in airlines like KLM, Emirates, Etihad etc.

I have a bunch of questions pertaining to career switch. I'm a software developer with a lot of interest in becoming a pilot, and a ~~stockholm~~ imposter syndrome. I just feel I'm not that of a good programmer.


1. I have a -3D eye prescription (after lasik but) correctable using glasses. Would I still qualify?
2. I'm 29 so by the time I complete training + 2000 hours I might be 31 or 32. Is it too late already?
3. Is it easier to find a job internationally? I make about ‚Ç¨7000 a month but with a job in Emirates or likes of it, I might make about ‚Ç¨8000 or more with the cost of an abnormal work schedule?
4. Also, is it worth it financially? I think I might spend ‚Ç¨100k to receive a slight bump on my salary.
5. How is the work life balance? I know pilots work in shifts but on an average do they work more than 40 hours a week or less?",AntiNationalDesi, An Indian origin pilot did an AMA here couple of years ago. Please do a search. Out of curiosity do you get 7000 net per month? Where do you work?,2018-06-16 05:25:07

We have an AMA scheduled with SM Hoax Slayer. It is a social media platform which works to dispel hoax and fake news, especially those that are extensively spread over Social Media like Facebook, Whatsapp and the like.

 It has over 55000 followers on facebook and has been prominently featured in various newspapers who have also quoted it as a source to dispel fake stories. The founder has also delivered a talk at TEDx Surat on the topic of fake news and the need for critical thinking and common sense when it comes to believing what you read or see on the internet.

Trying to be a smartass here: They will try to break you down in your training, change your individuality/past history and reshape you into what they want from a Civil Servant. Basically you will lose your individual mentality and become reshaped into the collective mentality of Civil Servants. My advise: PLEASE do not let them do that to you. Please continue having the mentality of an aam admi/common citizen rather than a person of authority. We really need civil servants who have the perspective just that of an ordinary common citizen.  r/india now has someone on the inside Congos , now don't loot the country man which i doubt you won't as most of you are anyways super corrupt .

AMA,'Sacred Games' AMA with Vikramditya Motwane and Varun Grover,292,92lsbe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/92lsbe/sacred_games_ama_with_vikramditya_motwane_and/,530,"We are:

Sacred Games show-runner + director Vikramaditya Motwane (Earlier, Director of Udaan, Lootera, Trapped, and Bhavesh Joshi)

and Sacred Games writer Varun Grover (earlier writer of 'Masaan' and lyricist of 'Gangs of Wasseypur', 'Ankhon Dekhi', Dum Laga Ke Haisha' etc)

We are here to answer questions about our recent Netflix series 'Sacred Games' - the first Netflix original from India.

Note: No questions regarding speculations about future seasons will be entertained.

UPDATE: Hi this is Varun Grover. Am stepping away for now. Will come back to answer some more later tomorrow. It was great fun. Thanks for your enthusiasm and love.

UPDATE 2: Vikram Motwane has also logged out. ""THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit."" ",vidushak," Thank you Varun and Vikramaditya for taking out the time to do this. It was a lot of fun interacting with you guys.

The AMA is over for now, Varun might drop in and reply to a few more questions later. Could there be a separate Netflix special of Katekar * No questions.
* Just came here to read and say thank you to both of you for such an amazing show. What happened to the guys who were locked by Anjali Mathur? XD Kukoo being discovered in the men's washroom. why would she not go the female washroom (and successfully hide her secret)? 
was it just for the audience (exposition)? What was so special about Sacred Games that you decided, yes, this is the one on which we'll make a TV series?  Sartaj is so morally upright - In the book he does take the occasional bribe / Hafta & the series doesn't  show that, Some petty corruption by policewalas is generally accepted without any judgement even in real life too, So why paint him so White?  THANKS GUYS!! this was great. Will do it again sometime. Thank you reddit.  Hey u/vmotwane , a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? When and will the OST of the show be out on music platforms?  hello all. great to be here!!! Max Mueller said that **""Mythology is a disease of language.""** That human beings have a habit of creating ideas/things and worshiping them as real things (reification).

Is there no way to counter the power of these tribal tendencies? Are we stuck between religious symbols  on one hand and patriotic/nationalistic symbols on the other?

What do you think about Yuval Noah Harari's hypothesis in Sapiens that myths are necessary for large number of humans to co-operate? Sartaj = Sacred, Gaitonde = Games? To Vikram, thank you for udaan. it's beautiful. I have seen it many times and actually showed it to my parents. they have now become your fans as well. :) The actor who was most likely to burst out laughing during a take? in first episode gaitonde's eyes are closed when he shots himself and they are open when sartaj looks at him again.....just tell me is this thing intentionally done for the story or is it just a creative touch to depict his background voice...2 din se sapne me bhi yehi doubt aa raha hai...just clear kardo The scene where Isa's men hit Gaitonde's home and he has to defend had a similar vibe to the scene in Gangs of Wasseypur. Was that intentional? Can you tell us the story of how Jitendra Joshi got casted as Katekar. Hello!

1. Why Zoya's characters look much younger than she actually should be acc. to the timeline of this series? Even Gaitonde, that marathi lady and also Sartaj's mother should've looked a decade older than they did in the 2018 storyline.

2. Why the present arc was set in 2018 instead of last decade?

3. What's next? Can we expect any announcement regarding any upcoming webseries soon? Have you ever seen pirated version of Netflix shows? Varun, the show had some extremely creative cuss words. Who comes up with them? How much of those are improvised? Bunty as a character hardly had any redeeming quality to him unlike Gaitonde and yet he managed to be quite charismatic and a treat to watch. How did you guys pull that off?  Varun what went into changing the timeline of the book to present day? Mumbai has changed so much since the book was written and so has technology what kind of impact did it have to the story in your opinion? Is Gaitonde Arun Gawli? * Why did you guys decide on historic episode names rather than going for standard ones ?

* Also, bit unrelated, but when can we expect Bhavesh Joshi sequel ?

* If not Nawazuddin, who do you think would've done the same amount of justice to Gaitonde's role as him ? What benchmark did you set to evaluate Sacred Games post season 1? Since it is a completely different medium for the both of you how do you judge how successful season 1 was? Any other book that you've read/know of that you would want to see adapted into an Indian web series, regardless of whether you're a part of it.  What's the most legitimate criticism are you working towards improving in future seasons? I love the portrayal of women in the series. There are hardly any movies or TV series which show such wide roles of women in a story. We have a mother, a whore, a girlfriend, a god mother, a lover, a goddess, a RAW officer, a divorcee, an actress, a wife, a sister. Each playing an important role in their life or of the men attached to them. I believe the book has to be credited for it. Why do you think we don't see this more often in Bollywood or even Hollywood Cinema ?  [deleted] Hi Sirs !
Congratulations on your success! God speed!

Q. Since both of you have worked in making of a movie, how was it different from making a Netflix series ?

Q.How much did the fact, that there is no CBFC to crap over your work, help you in expressing your artistic ideas ? Varun: Are you a full time writer now ? Given the success of SG. Or when is your next stand up tour planned for ?  Who came up with the idea of casting saif ali khan Did you give the actors any tips about their characters before the shoot? Did you advise them to read the book or put their own spin on the origin material? Please tell us a bit about the global response/feedback that Netflix would have received and may have given you specifically about the language. Because I have a feeling that the English audio and subtitles were not upto the mark. Even the folks in North India seems to have had issues understanding the Mumbaiya Hindi used. Could we get both of your views on that please. This is something I was thinking of when I watched the show. How did you expect the general public to react to the various sex scenes and nudity ghat show contained? Did you think you might have to answer to some random FIRS which are filed in the different parts of the country. Also - did you not consider the censor board threat?  Varun bhai, woh sab chhodo, ye batao ki Lucknow kab aa rahe ho? Hey Varun, which particular actor surprised you the most with their performance in terms of taking your writing to the next level just with their performance? A character that either of you wish didn't have to die so soon purely because their future arc could have been really interesting to explore? Hi, when Zoya reads the news of Gaitonde's death on Twitter, the tweet below the news tweet is a real tweet from November 2013 but story's timeline is June, 2018. So is that a random minor error or a reference to something? (Link to the tweet - https://twitter.com/naveen/status/403280901498368001?s=19) Malcolm is one of the most intriguing characters in the show, What made you cast Luke Kenny as Malcolm? (He was awesome)  
 Hi Varun/Vikram,

I liked Sacred Games a lot and cannot wait for the next season. My questions are:

* What were a few things in your vision that you could not pull off in Season 1? 
* What were some of the the constraints you faced while making SG S1?
* Are you working on any other projects with Netflix? (would love to see this partnership continue)

Regards

FAN  Hey! Hey!

First things first, kudos for the excellent work! Loved it!

Question: Radhika Apte says: get the IFS list. Gets someone named Sharma. Then says on the phone **""Sharma matlab Trivedi"" How?!**

Nameplate outside Trivedi's residence and everywhere else says Trivedi. Then why and how is Sharma is on the list. Why Sharma == Trivedi? The AMA is verified How is working with Netflix? What was the conversation in Writer's Room about Katekar's Death? Did you ever consider not killing him? How Killing him helps the Story? Couldn't you have used a lot more of him in future episodes? When will the music from Scared Games going to get released?(especially the intro music)

Do you think the story has enough fuel to make it through 4 seasons?

BTW I loved Trapped and thought it was more haunting then most of the horror movies in Bollywood. Also can you ask Anurag to release the remixed song ""Mere pairon main"" used in Mukkabaaz since it was pretty  dope. Hello Vikram and Varun,
I loved the show. Was your creative process for the show different from directing/writing a feature film? Which one do you prefer?  Hey Varun & Vikram, Hope you had lot of fun making Sacred Games. The background music was amazing & I have some doubts, problems with show but one basic question I have is this : Can you please tell me the reason why Sartaj was not killed immediately after he was caught by Mourad's men. What's the logic behind keeping Sartaj alive and Mourad torturing him? 

 Why is trivedi referred as sharma If babaji's bodyguards only rescues gaitonde how does matthu survive those men? (As he is in the opening scene) Hi! I liked Sacred Games, especially how every element had a lot of thought behind it. 
the 

There is this one thing which was baffling: how realistic was the portrayal that Gaitonde didn't know Kukkoo was a transgender, even after having sex for months? Did you expect the whole ""Rajiv Gandhi"" backlash? How come Trivedi and gaitonde were wearing the same kurta I still got goosebumps while watching chasing scene of Udaan, Thanks for that movie. Saif in his recent interview with Rajeev told that you MIGHT not direct the season 2 ? Why the fuck ? 

If Netflix brings in David Fincher/James Watkins and asks you to step down from director of SG season 2  ? Would you do it ?

Wouls you trade it for one episode of Black Mirror ?

P.S please don't do it for the world. We love you. Any recent Hollywood film you loved? As I have not read the book, is the story long enough to cover the four seasons planned?

For me this series was right up to the level of Breaking Bad and am really excited for season 2. Hey varun ,which genre you feel you have not explored and would like to do it the future? How can one pitch a show to Netflix? Kudos on the awesome series guys. Here r my questions ;

Did u expect this level of positive reception?

What's the timeframe you're targeting for the release of second season?  Hey, so when can we expect the ""Desh Sankat Me Hai"" promos for S2? 
 Vikram: I've been watching your movies for quite some time, from Udaan, to Lootera to Sacred Games. But frankly I had no picture to the name. Have you started coming out more and giving interviews a lot more than earlier ? Or is it just the success of the show that has pulled you out of your closet ?  Who exactly was Subhadra?
Kantabai's daughter? Hey guys, it's great to see so many characters and actors getting their due appreciation. Although I think Kanta Bai is an interesting character who deserves a better arc. Wish to see more of her in the upcoming seasons. 
 I really loved the design and references to mythology that you guys have on the show and the title/titlecards, Whose idea was to incorporate these elements in the show? They added a great new dimension which we rarely see in Indian shows. Did you think of casting Nana Patekar in the role of Gaitonde? Personally I felt Nawazuddin's 'physique' didn't match his 'stature'. IMHO. The character of Anjali Mathur is said to have been quite different from the book. Why was the decision to make it a ""feminist"" kinda character made? Amidst characters with very region-specific characterisations, Radhika Apte's character had no notion of religion or upbringing in a specific geography, etc. (e.g. Sartaj being a Sardar, Gaitonde being a Hindu from Maharashtra) Was that an intentional characterisation of her, given that she was a RAW agent? Her role somehow seemed unchanged from Lust Stories to Sacred Games. For Varun \[@vidushak\] - Who do you rely on to proofread your writings, to find gaps if any, to suggest improvements? Hi, could you please tell us about the casting, how were the actors decided and were there any compromised done? Saif Ali Khan did a great job imo. What made Phantom venture into the horror genre and produce Ghoul on Netflix? Vikram, as a creator, how much of an impact did you think the background score have on the final product? Top 5 foreign movies(non-English) you've watched? To VG: did you write any sequence that had to be altered on screen because of volume/intensity of cuss words?  What's with the colour palate/tone of the film? Was it your choice or its dictated by Netflix?  Hi Vikram and Varun Grover, I haven't read the book but I think the character arc of Sartaj Singh is very similar to a real life filmmaker. Sartaj witnesses that Parulkar killed Junaid even though he wasn't armed etc. Sartaj gets angry and walks out of the hearing, since can't see injustice happening etc. But much later we see Sartaj becomes part of the system and gives the statement in favour of Parulkar. Thus he empowers Parulkar. Probably Parulkar was aware that nothing will happen to him and everyone will favour him and hence committed the crime (no matter how honest any of his colleagues are). This is very similar to filmmaker who came to know that his partner(a filmmaker) was involved in sexual harrasment, got angry, wanted to set things right but eventually favored his colleague and let him continue work, thus becoming part of the patriarchy system and ended up empowering his colleague. Curious to know if the arc was inspired by this real story?  Will we get OSTs on digital platforms for the series? Smart thinking on having Divine for Kaam 25, he is fire. Hi Vikram,
I want to know if that glass wall in Gaitonde's hiding place was inspired from the glass wall of Jimmy's office in Better Call Saul? (link- https://imgur.com/96ii4pj)  Hey Vikram, any of your favourite scenes that didn't make the final cut? Can you share anything about them? I love Vince Gilligan‚Äôs Breaking Bad and Better call Saul (I heard Mr. Motwane does too). Specially love how these two use some simple, recurring personal conflicts as the core without needing to add new conflicts every episode or season.

With the nuclear coming in I‚Äôm afraid season 2 might get even more over plotted. I hope Im wrong (I should read the book for the answer?) Any adjustments you guys plan to bring to the writing? I‚Äôd be super curious to know. When do we expect the Second Season ? 
Any tip from Netfilx side ? 
 1. How exactly are we hearing Gaitonde‚Äôs narrator voice after he has killed himself? Is all this exposition happening in Sartaj‚Äôs imagination? Or did Gaitonde have so much time on that phone call to tell him about all of this?
2. Really appreciated the fact that everybody spoke in their native languages. But I felt that principle was broken by having Gaitonde speak so little Marathi. Was this deliberate? If so, why? Hey. Who was the most fun person on the set?

Sacred Games is a masterpiece. I loved the show and would like to see more of Sartaj soon. Hello Varun, Vikram! 
Here are my questions for the both of you

1. I admire your writing for its consistency and nuanced attention to detail, but I connect the most with the emotional depth and honesty.
My question is how do you choose where to draw the line in terms of emotional honesty, or at what point do you find it to be counterproductive, as far as character growth is concerned? 

2. Has there been anything that you've pitched and Netflix has protested? Or do you have full creative control over the show? Greetings! Thanks for doing this!   


For Vikram - Favourite memory working with Anurag Kashyap?  


For Varun - Which movie has inspired you?   


Again,thanks for doing this and absolutely loved Sacred Games! Cheers!  Some dialogues seemed directly derived from the stories behind the episode titles - was that a consciously done or is it just coincidence?Example: [np.reddit.com/r/sacred\_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation\_correlating\_episode\_titles\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/sacred_games/comments/8xo7z6/appreciation_correlating_episode_titles_to/) What did inspire the fake encounter sub-plot? On one hand we see you guys launching so many talented actors (especially women) here with such a strong cinema and brilliant story, and on the other hand Bollywood couldn't even manage or better spoiled a good story (sairat) just to launch some dumb ass star kids. Your take on this. Of course I am talking about your opinion on Nepotism in Bollywood.  Hello to both the lovers of the art. My question is for both of you -

Do you had many of the parallels/references, that are coming out now about particular scenes, in your mind right from the beginning? The best one I saw was Gaitonde the young kid saying - ""Apun ko naya dharam mangta tha"" to Buddha going out in search of truth, and *founding* buddhism.

 Hey guys, loved the series.

Mainstream Bollywood still seems to live in a dream world of rich kids facing limp conflicts. Rural India is shown as clean, colorful with its own set of 'cliche' issues. Any body who has traveled into even urban rural areas knows how dirty and grimy it is.The romanticization of shitty things in India ('The Spirit of Mumbai!!!') has gone too far. Our people always attend movies where everything is rosy and the fucked up things in our country are shown as memes unto themselves. Movies in a lot of ways define culture and mainstream Bollywood seems to not understand this. They think entertainment is innocent. Any thoughts regarding this?

In the endeavor of articulating our present state, how  were you able to pull off the veneer and not fall into the trap of glossing over the 'dirt' in our society, but actually baring open for all to see the 'real' side of India. Are you also writing or creating keeping in mind the dire need to articulate our society and get people to finally see the gaping holes in a rapidly decaying culture?

Apologies if this comes off as rambling, but would love a  conversation around this. Subhadra in one of the episodes speaks about the Ganpati festival and what it means to the people celebrating it. It made so much sense and Rajshri, I believe took it to next level. Wanted to know whose idea it was? It was a brilliant monologue! Hey Varun,

No questions, just a big thank you for writing Masaan. It is my favourite movie of all time, and I've lost count of how many times I've watched it now.

Thank you! @Varun - Whens the next aisi taisi democracy show happening?

@ Vikramaditya Motwane - thank you for Udaan and Lootera. that's all.  Hello Vikram and Varun.

I love how mythology is used in the show. Which chracter from Indian Mythology so you find the most interesting and why? In retrospect, what things would you change about Season 1? This is to both of you. (Don't say nothing) Vikram, a lot of the outdoor night scenes used had a lot of obviously yellow lighting. Apart from the obvious street lighting aesthetic was that a deliberate creative choice to set a particular tone? While I loved Sacred Games, I found it disappointing that every time a female character gained any importance, she was killed off. Can we not have that future seasons? What was the overall budget of SG ? How does it compare to a typical Bollywood movie ? Hey, also I was wondering. In writing for the show, where did you look for inspiration? What films, stories, serials if any helped shape your idea for telling these stories?   Why are you not directing season 2?
Why did Ganesh kill chota badariya? Hi Vikram, Varun! Here are the questions:


1.
Many artists keep to themselves and their team so that their creative process is not diluted. You on the other hand are pretty much active on social media and also end up acknowledging reviews, fans, criticism. Does the response help you change your process or would you rather stick to your conviction?

2.
Hey Varun, since you are back in the stand up, do we expect a special from you? 
Also who are your favorite upcoming stand up comics from India? I loved the series and it's many layered narratives . When can we expect the next season ? Hi Varun & Vikram, Excellent job with the script and direction. I wanted to know Who wrote the dialogues for the part Anurag directed?  1. Can you talk about your inspirations for the visual look of the series? I feel Sacred Games really embraced the dingy, 3rd world tube light lighting prevalent in India. 

2. Does the director take HDR into consideration while planing the shots with DP? Your favorite TV show and movie? Hi Varun,

Will we any comments on recent Indian political history in the show?
May be between the period 1995-2015? I was wondering why Gaitonde's Hindi would have a North Indian accent as opposed to having a strong Marathi slant given his background and upbringing. Was it considered? Which is your favourite TV Show other than Sacred Games? Hi everyone, Vikramaditya Motwane and Anurag Kashyap aside, who would be your individual choices for directing the two segments? And can a director affect a tv series significantly given they have tight scripts to follow? Bhagwan mein vishwas karte ho? 

How different or similar is your personal concept of god to the one portrayed in the series?  

 What precautions do you take while writing for the present Indian audience?  

Great work guys it was a liberating experience to have prolonged engagement with realistically portrayed fleshed out characters. Never understood how people get so emotionally involved with a sports team they have no connection with untill I saw the quality product you have delivered and felt a little vicarious pride to be part of the context. Sad to say havent felt this patriotic in recent years.  Was there an option to cast anyone else apart from saif Ali khan as the main lead ? hello , 
 why are you not directing season 2 ? 
Any other book you would like to adapt ?
And why was the relationship with parulkar changed from the book ?
Why was chota badariya killed?

 Hello Vikram, since Varun Grover's razor-sharp satirical commentary on religious fanaticism is exceptionally well, will we see him directing a few episodes in next season?  If Gaitonde is dead, how is he narrating his story?
Edit: A word Have either of you been following fan theories that have going around? How was the experience of making the show with the knowledge that there is no CBFC involved? Did you have any 'quality control' from Netflix side? 1. what guidelines does netflix pass to directors for a series?
1. 
1. what are the ""must haves"" from netflix in the show or each episode? Hi. Big fan of you both. Any chance you would collaborate on a comedy caper (Series or movie)? Almost all the best TV series or even movies are inspired from best selling novels. Does that mean if you want to be a movie script writer, you should probably learn to be book writer ?

Varun defies this statement but is it true in general ?  Off-topic..

What are your fav places to relax and enjoy the vibe? What about script screenplay set design etc?  Favourite Mumbai snack ?  Which disease is Sartaj suffering from? I am really shocked to see Radhika Apte dead in the very 7th episode .. Don't you think her character should be little bit longer ? 
Varun & Vikram i want both's perspective on it  Will you be including Aadil or Mary in the next season? How has the international response been to the show ? I mean do you have some statistics like % of international viewers from Netflix ? top film mate cheers keep it up Varun What level of improvisation happened compared to the script? And comparing the two directors. Hi question goes to both of you, Gaitonde is dead in the first episode then how is he narrating the story? When you guys have specially shown the build up of phone conversation between the two characters. I think you could have find an other way out also Why did Gaitonde kill his mother? What did he actually think of his father? Shit! I missed it! why saif ali khan as a lead ? are you going to reveal sartaj and megha's back story anytime soon? Is there any similarity between the character of Gaitonde and real life Don Chhota Rajan?

Isa = Dawood...? Spin off sartaj singh?  Varun, considering how you've always been an advocate of a gender equal society and been a feminist in general, and taking into account how big an impact hit movies and shows have on its watchers, do you think the use of expletives involving women could have been avoided? Did Netflix impose any sort of restrictions on Sacred Games at a writing/production stage like Amazon Prime Video does? What‚Äôs the funniest meme  you have seen about the series? What is the most practical, sensible advice would you have for aspiring writers with no experience in film in this changing media landscape? Hey Varun, a personal question. 

**Who is your favourite character?** And what makes him/her your favourite? There is a character Aadil in the book, which was missing from Season 1 , will that will character come in upcoming season?
And what should we all expect that will come in season 2 .. which will help us fulfill our hunger for season 2 till it comes ? Loved the show, especially the way it was written. It was great to see  the characters speak the way a regular person in their situation would.  But do you ever feel that the ever so creative Indian *gaalis* overshadow the content sometimes?¬†   Hi Sir, Congratulations on the success of Sacred Games. Will both of you also collaborate on Udaan2? When can we expect it to hit theatres?  Was Saif Ali Khan your first choice for Sartaj? I also heard that Saif was the only actor in the whole cast who has read the book? Do you think reading the book gives the advantage to portray the character? Hey guys, I asked Varun the same question last time, so I will spare him this time around.

So Vikram, what's your writing process like, what kind of hours you put when working on a script, how much inspiration you take from your daily surroundings and conversations and what's the greatest screenplay ever written according to you.

Also no niceties for you guys! *Screams katekars name*
 
Nah, just kidding, you guys are awesome, making our movie industry save grace, keep up the great work. How were you guys able to keep up with both the Gaitonde's and Sartaj's narrative together? Was it already decided at the writing stage or was edited later as per the requirement of the episode? Are you guys planning to release **sacred games** Soundtrack?  A lot of hardwork has gone into the making of the show. How much time did it take from Script writing to promotions in total to launch the show on Netflix?

  


Goodluck for season 2. Take your time and make sure it at least as good as the first season or even better. :) What's your response to the courts verdict about you needing to be careful. Will this affect the quality of the show in any way. Hey guys,

Did you all have full creative independence regarding the story and all the scenes shot or were there any restrictions that Netflix put on you or something that you guys thought this was too far.

Btw enjoyed the show and can't wait for the next season.

Edit: The slow creeping shots that setup most of the scenes were amazing, are those ode to your fav scenes in any movies? if yes then what all? Would love to work with this creative team. We are at dire need to change the television content currently broadcasting all over Zee, star, Galaxy and universe.The success of Sacred Games be the bedrock of the new age of Indian Televised Entertainment!
This script is pretty worked on and the scenes are beautifully portrayed. Kudos to the team for the venemous show #sacredgames #IndiaTVRevolution What would you advice amateur screenplay writers who want to make a name for themselves in the future? When will Netflix anounced season 2 or more accurately why hasn't Netflix anounced season 2 ? After the response you've received for the show , how mature do you think Indian audience has gotten over the years? And do you think at this pace, sacred games will be just an average show in the time to come?  Why did gaitonde ended up buying a rolce royce instead of that red car  If someone got a good script how to pitch it to you guys? were you satisfied with the line of dialogue delivered by gaitonde after cuckoo's death where he says ""main bhagwan ke bhi upar h""?

that looked bit odd to me. How's Nawazuddin Siddiqui with nudity Vikram your favourite Black Mirror episode.?? Sorry but the hindi translation seemed a bit off for some crucial moments.

Like when Sartaj or Katekar says ‡§Ü‡§à ‡§ù‡§µ‡§≤‡•Ä, hindi captions are ‡§π‡•á ‡§≠‡§ó‡§µ‡§æ‡§®. These don't carry the weight of the expression. Do you mind working on this? Found the last episode confusing. It didn't really clear anything for me. I failed to understand so much in season finale. Hopefully next season will clear what's going on. Hey guys, great work on Sacred Games. Thanks for the AMA!

I have a different sorta question - as someone who consumes a lot of Indian movies and series, we've all fantasied about writing a better story/screenplay than some of the crap we see. I know it's much harder to actually write a good story than to dream about it, but what would your advise be to someone who wants to write an original story/screenplay? How should one get it ""out there"" once they are done? Is the best course of action to write a small story and shoot a budge short film? Or just submit stories to the studios directly? This is assuming that a full-time course like AIB First Draft, etc aren't viable right now.  Any of your regular (favourite) food or drink joints where I can find you ? üòõ I am currently reading the book after watching the TV series. I found that a lot of storylines have been changed. For example Cuckoo is a very minor character in the book, Sartaj is not so honest among others. What was going in your mind when you started writing for the show? What motivated you to make some changes? One or two examples will be very helpful!! I just loved the show. Can't wait for the next season. So here are my questions - 

1. Was Saif your first choice for Sartaj Singh? 

2. Did you expect the Bofors line to become  such a big controversy? How did you find Rahul Gandhi's response?

3. Why did you choose Netflix over other online streaming platforms? How was the experience? 

 How much liberty were you given by Vikram Chandra in visualising his book? Did you need approvals from him?  The main villian's every dialogue was very cringy, was it supposed to be so or you guys couldn't find someone else. Hey Vikram, will Bhavesh Joshi Superhero end up saving the city from nuclear attack? You two have been in the industry for a long time now and might have watched many an artist such as yourself still struggling to 'make it' (doesn't necessarily mean creating something as tight and amazing as SG on a scale as large as Netflix, but I hope you get the idea). Is there anything that you did different from these people and would like to share it with young people who are looking forward to entering the industry and beginning their journey as artists?  The fact that Gaitonde killed his mother has left me bewildered. Why did he kill his mother?  What did he actually thought of his father?  for me the best actors were parulkar katekar cuckoo nawajuddin. Why is there no dubbing to other Indian languages? Do add Tamil Varun, who wrote the Marathi dialogues? Some of those puns were really good. I think Saif Ali Khan aka Satraj plays a very little role and its kind of biased to see his name appear first in the name of the actors. Nawazuddin Siddiqui's name should have appeared first. Saif was awesome as a sardarji, can we expect sequel? Great work on the show! Can't wait for season 2.
How can more ""bold"" films and TV shows be brought into mainstream media?  How should aspiring screenwriters, who think they can write a web-series like Sacred Games go about it? Who should they approach? Is Trivedi dead or alive Udaan is one of my fav movies of all time, watched it when i was in college, emotionally attached to it.. thanks for it.

will you release the sacred games OST? How could gaitonde crush the heads of both his mother and the man at the same time Hey, Varun and Vikramaditya! Congratulations on the series. I enjoyed it, but it was more wonderful for me to see how much my parents and grandparents and so many of their friends enjoyed it too. 

What has the response felt like for you so far? Do you also find the show appealing so much to unexpected demographics because of the very specific picture of Mumbai it paints?  Is babaji planning a nuclear attack so that he could predict it and proclaime himself as a godman Where some of the soundtrack in Sacred games similar to soundtracks of Game of Thrones or am I the only one feeling so? @Varun - Kamra, Rathee or you - who will ""called out"" by the BJP first? (cue your youtube comment banter!)

PS - Stellar work guys - have rewatched it twice already! Q1: I feel the character of Sarjat is very lame. He is very mediocre. Doesn't react on time when it is much needed and always ends up in a goofed up situation. Why is it made like that?

Q2: How many seasons can we expect for Sacred Games? I am looking forward to the next one after the cliff hanger by the last episode. When can we expect second season? Is this verified by the mods of r/india or anything? Q1. Did the liberation from censorship actually overwhelm you? like a small kid in a fair?
Q2. What sort of treatment from Indian media were you expecting after the release? Vikram will you be completely involved in the second season? Also have you guys already planned on how many seasons this show will go on for. Huge fan of the show. Congratulations to the whole team.  Hey varun and vikram big fan of the show.


1.My question is will you be loyal to the books written by the author for future seasons or take it another direction entirely? 

2.Are there any plans to bring more such content on netflix from your team specifically in the near future?

3.Were there any  stars you approached before going for saif ali khan for the role of Sartaj?

Thanks for doing this AMA ,you guys deserve all the praise you are getting for this amazing show,kudos! I am curating an Online Treasure Hunt themed on Sacred Games. Would you like to check out the hunt and possibly collaborate to make the levels even more intriguing? What are the pros and cons of working on a series as compared to working on a movie project. What do you prefer and why? When will be season 2 in production? Hey Vikram, Congratulations on the whole series. I loved it. Watched it  twice and would soon go for a third round. Have so many questions but chose 5-6 of them for here. 

How did you decide to switch between the two timelines ? Or was it specified pretty nicely in the book ? 

P.S Posting other questions in further comments.  What's your favorite English TV show of all time?  A question for both of you,

Which books are you reading now ? Was it liberating for you guys? Because you didn't have to deal censorship and all. It felt realistic with the gaalis and the episodes with cuckoo and her sexuality. I really feel this is a benchmark for the coming Indian TV shows or movies. Hi Vikramaditya, I have been following your career for a while and have seen some of your work (Udaan, Lootera and Sacred Games). A common theme has been that emerges is the internal conflict that all your protagonists seem to face (Eg. Ranveer in Lootera, Saif in SG, Rajat in Udaan). Do you do this intentionally to provide layers to these characters or would you say its a fair representation of how humans really are? Looking forward to seeing more of your work! 

And Varun, your Padmaavat stand up piece on youtube has become my go to video when i feel stressed. Thank you for that!  Varun, what was it like adapting from an existing book? How was it different? Did it feel constrained at times? How did you pick the elements you wanted to add/ delete? For the underworld bits, did you take from existing writing on Bombay's underworld? 

 Dear r/vidushak,

You're the best and I've been a fan since much before GoW, Masaan, DLKH etc.

Your clarity of thought is just astounding and I love how you're never ready to take a stand and never late to apologize or learn if you're wrong.

Since I have to ask a question, I'll ask what your favorite Twitter handles are? (Sorry it's just the first question that came to my mind) /u/vidushak, what do you enjoy more, working on your stand up routines or working on movies/shows like Massan, Sacred Games? 

Saw you a couple of times in Mumbai doing stand-up a few years ago, its always fun to watch you :) Some general questions on writing.

Q1. When you people write something original, do you first write in form of a story and then adapt it to a screenplay, or directly a screenplay?

Q2. When you start writing, what is the thing you already have in your mind?? The total conflict? the story gist? Or just like you start and try building the characters and situations with a blank mind?

Q3. What is the difference in approach in writing an adapted screenplay (Sacred Games,  Lootera) to a completely original and fresh one (Masaan, Trapped)?


Thank you. First of Vikram and Varun, great great job you guys. SG has reached cult status. Which new actor has impressed you the most?  Varun ,when did you start writing and what things helped you at the Beginning? How does the budget compare to say an Indian production? Hello everyone .. my question is from Varun ji .. how you're feeling after the great success of the Sacred Games its kind of Indian GoT ! 
How is your experience to co-write the story of not so successful Novel do you expected this much success of serial during writing it ? for u/vmotwane,

After watching the final cut, did you feel that there was something that you could have directed better or with your own perspective in anurag's story arc ? First of all thank you for taking a much needed step of creating a tv series which has all the elements of what a large audience always wanted.

I have two questions here.

First, what is the reception to the show in the industry. Do you think the reception of the show with the audience would help move the money to this kind of content or is this genre still too niche for the industry to swivel towards it.

Second, how is it working with another director. Were there parts where you (question for Vikramaditya) and Anurag Kashyap where  had difference in opinion and how do you come to conclusion to it.

Lastly, thank you again for making this show. I hope to see the third baap real soon. Congratulations on picking up a worthy material and giving Indian audiences something new. But having read the book I think the treatment could have been better and I would like to get your opinion on this. 

I feel a lack of connect with the characters, of course the major characters of Gaitonde and Sartaj have their backgrounds told so we understand their motives somewhat but what about Jojo, Mathur, Kanta bai and of course Parulkar sahab excellent actors all btw. I guess if we could have had a concept like in the show orange is the new black where all such characters had a side track running along with the main track. Taking audiences through their past through which we could understand and relate. 

Also a request I don‚Äôt think KD will come in the show but please please put him in one episode as a flashback or something, that guy has a potential for a tangent show all by himself.  Is the home minister trying to defend the attack or he is cooperating with the attackers What's your take on nepotism ruling bollywood? Why are you contributing to nepotism by employing someone who has a series of flops? Will a non-star parivaar actor get a chance after so many flops? 

https://www.timesnownews.com/entertainment/box-office/article/5-years-7-flops-%E2%80%93-will-kaalakaandi-salvage-saif-ali-khans-sinking-career-graph/187623

The only choice for an unconnected non-star parivaar was Netflix / Webisodes /Youtube and independent directors. Now that you have also shut the door on such hopeful actors. Sir HD link milega with 100+ seeders ? üòÇ [deleted] [deleted]",2018-07-29 02:01:30

hmmm
 [deleted] I actually interviewed here in the past. Wasn't a good experience but won't blame it totally on them. 
I think in this business model, only flaw is that the user gets the cashback 2-3 months after the transaction(which is still not sure, like 40% of the times, it gets denied) 
It's a good model but sadly it'll never be scalable to a large audience.   So, reddit is promoting a bunch of highly educated scammers. Nice. FUCK. She doesn't have a wikipedia page. > Swati Bhargava is the Co-founder of CashKaro.com - India‚Äôs largest Cashback & Coupons site

Pretty sure coupondunia and mydala are bigger The comments tell me this AMA gon be gooood. This is weak From the comments, it looks like the AMA will be a shitshow and as such I totally expect it to either get canceled or poorly answered. 

I rarely see AMAs on r/india, so to see an AMA like this one surprises me. Mods need to give more details how they chose this to be hosted. Is this a promotion? Does copying an idea count as being called an Entrepreneur?
And no innovation or difference!
Ola maybe a copy of uber but they have some of their own ideas and method.of operation!
But cashkaro!
Seriously! A good potential thread for women of randia to discuss starting a company.

However.

There is an error in my logic.

Do follow me on twitter - [https://twitter.com/haripyt](https://twitter.com/haripyt) and we can continue the convo there as well! ",hari_ganapathy," a stupid question:

how is your service better/different from thomas cook/SOTC/Balmer&Laurie ? How many times were you close to bankruptcy? When you are bootstrapped how do you decide salary for founders? Saw your website and really liked the interface. tried planning a Euro trip and my questions are based on that relative experience:

1. Am I right in saying that your website does not sell pre -packaged travel packages rather it gives the user an option to select from within the pre-selected vendor options to ""customise"" their tour? So essentially you are a marketplace of vendors with a travel layer on top to facilitate bookings?
2. Your website helps customise an itinerary but optimising the itinerary is still missing anything you are doing to fix that?
3. I tried creating an account but your website seems content to let me plan without creating an account which is good but created an itinerary and wanted to save it by logging in and couldn't do that?
4. If i directly get in touch with your travel experts to help me create an itinerary will they charge me for that..sorry didn't find that info anywhere? 1. What was your toughest customer service experience?


2. What about backpacking options when visiting a country? For example, exploring areas that are not touristy or somewhat secluded.


3. What are your views on legalizing marijuana in India? Would it change tourism sector in any way and would it change your list of offerings?

4. Let's say a tourist is caught for some illegal activity or a tourist loses their passport. How do you handle such unforeseen circumstances? I am very impressed with the website so I decided to see how it works and looked for Newzeland as an option. And next day onwards I am being called by your representative. I received already 3 calls 1 sms and 1 email.  Hello,
As someone who has used this service, I have had a mixed experience. It's a really nice concept to choose the activities and opt out of the things which doesn't seem to interest the individual.
We have had hiccups during the trip planning and the trip. These could have been better - especially the communication with the overseas partners as well as the visa agents and the ones from PYT who was managing our trip (this was resolved after escalations and the agent was changed) 

Also someone was supposed to get back to me regarding an issue but then forgot to, as this was post the vacation. I would have had a better opinion if the person followed through on this than leaving it.

Anyways, my first international vacation was through you guys and I will always remember the good and the bad. 

Suggestion - Improve the collection of preset activities 
 What is the motivation behind this project? Also, how did you get your first paying customers? [deleted] [deleted] Do you consider [Please.com](https://Please.com) as your competitors? Any job openings?  Are you hiring for Digital Marketing? Did the AMA finish? [removed] What are the payment options? Do you support National travel? Are you planning to in future? One thing that bugs me about travel agencies in general is that none of them are upfront about where they get their margins from. If an agent tells me, up front, that this is the itemized bill for your itinerary, plus this is my x% profit, I'd gladly pay up - if I can verify that the items in the bill match whatever I see on [booking.com](https://booking.com) or [hotels.com](https://hotels.com) or wherever.

OTOH if an agent doesn't reveal this, I have no visibility on how much (and where) the travel agent is making his money, leading to the suspicion that I am being ripped off at every point. And if I have to constantly double-check his rates, I might as well do the same thing myself.

I and my family of 4 have made four international trips (two in Asia, two in Western Europe) over the last 9 years, and for the last European vacation we did all the research/online booking/visas ourselves. It was an exhasting/time consuming process, and I would have gladly paid extra for a trustworthy agent. Hi Hari, I am Om. How do you do? Just checked the site and did some planning for trips that i have already done and your costs are pretty decent to be honest. 

Only thing that i would like to ask is how do you handle situation where someone faces some issue with the hotel , where its your clients word against the hotel? And how will u arrange for a hotel in middle of night if the client does not wnat to stay and wants to change the hotel becuase of some valid reason. 

This is most important becuase even  single ruined night will ruin the next few days of tge trip and also your repeat business. Hi Hari, congratulations on accomplishing this huge milestone. I didn't know you guys were THAT old! :-)  
My questions:

* Can you regale a story/anecdote/incident (from a customer's perspective) on how smooth the said PYT customer experience is?
* How has your perspective on personalization and customer experience changed from day 0 till today?
* What plans for the future? What should PYT customers should be excited about? Hey. This is the first time I've heard about the website. Had a look and it looks quite neat. 

How much of your traffic pick from the available packages and how much is custom plans?

What's an upcoming destination request that you get the most in the last year? My question would be at what point after founding the company did you observe a huge influx of customers and also what you think caused that influx ? How far you can provide customized experience in travel?  You will be able to find a very less common interest between an adventure traveller and a honeymooner. The thing that I'm not able to understand is, the interests & expectations of a traveller varies based on their purpose of travel.  [deleted]",2018-11-29 00:55:29

1. There seems to be complete radio silence on the Nag program ever since Ajai reported [target acquisition issues](http://ajaishukla.blogspot.com/2012/07/indian-army-and-drdo-co-operate-to.html) in 2012. Is the missile ever going into production, or is it effectively dead?

2. Some news outlets report that the MiG-29K has been a rather poor performer, and that the Navy isn't very happy with it. They say the avionics don't perform as well as advertised, the structure was found to be too weak for repeated carrier landings, and then there was also the CAG report that pointed to atrocious serviceability levels. What's your take? Is this all true or exaggerated?

-- Shiv From /u/seb-aur-santare:

How would you deal with Kashmir if given the chance? What do you think are the big changes in Indian defence policy since NDA? Hello Shiv.  Thanks for doing this AMA.  Why would you feel you are qualified to write about defence? Do you have a defence background?  what is the reason for  really  large import inventory  for defence equipment ? are indian  defence manufacturing totally bust ? 

recently their was chatter about ammunition selection? any takes from your side. Why is there so much resistance to induct Tejas and Arjun? Are yardsticks being shifted constantly or are there are genuine problems in the two platforms?  1. what do you think are some crucial defence programs under development for India's future?

2. do you think India already has the capability for MIRV, but is kept under rug? if no, how far are we from having it? if yes, why is it kept a secret?

3. how successful do you  think India's Anti Ballistic Missile program is? will it be successful in real situations? What are your views on Aadhaar with regards to security on the digital frontier?  Via /u/chipsnmilk

>* Thank him for covering the an32 Missing incident when noone else did. One of the pilot was a friend.

>* Ask him about Dhruv or ALH control/design issues, is hal covering them up?
 Can we carry a taser in India for self defense ? I've been following your career Shiv. You have done amazingly!

How is the experience like to be lobbyist, deal broker for Defence companies? Shiv, what are your personal views regarding the recent incident where a person was tied to the Army Jeep in J&K ? Does the defence correspondent Shiv has different views than the person Shiv ? What are your views on India asking for ToT for virtually everything these days? Do you think that India will become a push over in geo-political arena gradually because almost all big powers will be able to bargain with us by throwing ToT cookie? Which sector of our defence capabilities do you consider to be weak?  Hey Shiv,

I noticed that recently during the Delhi ByPolls India Today was more focused on AAP losing than BJP winning (with literally running banners of AAP losing) why do you think that is?

What do you think that Indian News Channels need to do be more truthful rather than neutral in a debate? 
 How to create big Defence Industry in India? also Aerospace Industry of our own?

Surely we cant depend on Importing stuff, should we have special Institutions and Research projects, if no scientists in India why not pay more for foreign scientists to come to India until we develop our Industry.

Should Indians or at least some, have some kind of minimum training like Israelis? 

 Hi Shiv,
What do you make of the Navy's decision to give the NLCA a pass? In your opinion, could the navy have been supportive by placing a limited order and not rejecting the jet completely? Your personal choice between Saab Gripen E or F 16 Block 70 fighter for the Indian Air Force?  Ever since Trump suggested a wall along the Mexican border, his opponents have suggested that there are better ways to improve border security by technological innovations like using drones, etc. 

We share a very hostile border with Pakistan and China, with terrible terrain for soldiers to be deployed. How is our defense handling this? Are there plans to invest in drones for border security? 

Have the Indian defense contractors been reliable in the past?  Hi Shiv, thanks for doing AMA. I closely follow you and all the best for new inning in Livefist.

My question is about India's nuclear counter strategy. I know that our nukes are not always on standby mode, like those of USA's minutemen missiles & erst while USSR or current Russia. We keep nukes separated from launch vehicles. Both are guarded by different departments.

Now my question is, what if in an surprise enemy attack on nation's capital during,say Republic day celebrations, when our entire Civil & Military leadership is present there and is wiped out in one strike, who will than authorize nuclear counter attack?
Do we have any concept like ""Designated Survivor"", in which USA appoints a low ranking cabinet official during their annual State of the Union address when entire Civil-Military leadership gather under one roof so if any thing catastrophic happens on Capital Hill, that designated survivor can command and control entire nation.

Do we have any plan for this scenario?

Thanks. Hi Shiv my defense question is, when do you think India will be able to project it's military like the US, China & Russia does?

Also do you think we should be more involved in international affairs since Sri Lanka intervention left us with sour memories, should it keep us a spectator on an international level? In 2015 Government had ordered setting up Joint Cyber and Special Forces command. What are our Cyber Warfare capabilities and whether Government is still interested in setting up joint cyber command??
 http://pib.nic.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=158187
The above report mentions about something called Stealth Wing Testbed (SWiFT) being developed by DRDO. What is this thing??

1. What are the factors delaying the Strategic Partnership in defense policy and do U expect it to be resolved within NDA 2?

2. Where do our Special Forces fit in the overall mindset of our strategic planners? Can we see increasing role and a SFC soon?

3. With increasing importance of Indian Ocean in India's security matrix and plans for increased amphibious assets, do we have any expeditionary forces in plan like the Marine Corps of the US?

4. Gripen or F-16? :P Your favourite TV series? What is your reading of the situation in Kshmir? Where do you source your Indian defense news from? I understand you are the source for most civilians. But if you had to point a layman to keep track of Indian defense news, which sites or blogs would you point him to?  Hi there, Your tweets are high energy!

**LAST EDIT: Hi again! I feel like this has wound down, so I'm going to be off. Here's my last message:**

Thank you so much for making this AMA so much fun! I learned so much about India and I can relate to you all so much! I wish we could all get along better. We are literal kin, far back and deep down. I would love to come to India some day and meet people as lovely and hilarious and curious as you lot! And I'd love it if you guys came down to my country, too!

Finally, I'll leave you all with a quote from A Song of Ice and Fire which reminds me about the partition, and what a tragedy it was, and how we can all strive to do better, and love each other as the brothers and sisters we really are:

>‚ÄúIt all goes back and back,"" Tyrion thought, ""to our mothers and fathers and theirs before them. We are puppets dancing on the strings of those who came before us, and one day our own children will take up our strings and dance in our steads.‚Äù

Let's not be puppets. Let's love and share and break the cycle that has been handed down to us.

Namaste <3",WhereIsLordBeric," Do you place a newspaper as a separator between the wood and your clothes before filling your wardrobe/closet with clothes.

 In India, our parents like to compare  their children with the infamous ""sharma ji ka ladka"". Does this also happen with you too? I don't really have a question, but I just want to appreciate how you've handled this ama so far. Polite replies to curt questions and humbly shutting off the people looking to stir things up. Cheers! I bet it‚Äôs a dude baiting for karma.  Hi! 


Could you recommend some Pakistani/Mughlai dishes that I may not have heard of before(as in, ones which are local-pakistani-in origin)?


Also, would you ever want to visit India? 


 How is life in Pakistan? How do your family see the fact that you're 27 and unmarried? They make a big fuss about this in India apparently. Is inbreeding truly common in pakistan (marry 1st or 2nd cousin)? Or it‚Äôs just the west trying to dmg the image of the pakistani people. * Have you ever been on a motorcycle?

* Have you been outside of Pakistan or do you plan to ( for travel etc ), to where?

* What's the popular smartphone brand in Pakistan?

* Do you follow muslim dress code? like wearing hijab and all
 Have you seen 'The Office' - US?  Was your family native Pakistani or they migrated from India. Mine migrated from peshawar.  I wanted to ask why do Pakistanis use 'ay' at the end, instead of 'e' or 'ein'? I had a Pakistani friend a looong time back, and type ""miltay hay"" instead of ""milte hain"". ""Baate karein"" to ""baatay karay"". Koi ladki patwa do aap :( What's the difference between you and average Pakistani woman? What are the things about Pakistan you love the most?

What about Pakistan do you dislike the most?

Favourite book? Do you guys have ""Karachi Biscuits""? What‚Äôs the dating scene like in Pakistan  I just came back from office and reading this, interesting conversation. Thanks for this. 

Have you seen TV series Mad Man, if you haven't, you must.

I am insanely fasinated by Pakistan, wo kehte hain na: Jis Lahore nahi vekhya, wo janmya hi nai. Ravi to chenab puchdaaaaa, ki haal ae satluj Da üò¢ Keeping music and making football aside What else Pakistan does better than everybody else?  1) please recommend some Pakistani books/movies/songs.

2) how much history do they teach in school ? Do they teach about Mughals ? Indian freedom fighters? Would you ever eat bacon?  What were the expectations you had to live up to when growing up (studies, relationships, etc.)? What's your favorite -

1) Food

2) Song

3) Movie

4) Travel destination Welcome to Randia!

My Q is: What were/are you guys taught above Pakistan history and origin in History class in school. IIRC We (Indians) were/are taught about:
1. Ancient India: Birth of religions, Aryans and Vedic culture
2. Medieval India:  Maurya Empire, Delhi Sultanates, Mughals, Kingdoms in South India , etc
3. Modern India: Ideologies and contribution of many freedom fighters in independence of India ( Pakistan) from British India , Independence Movements, etc

History was quite extensive (and boring) for us. Since before 1947 you guys were technically Indians, so are you guys taught about only last 70 years or only about Muslim Movements or about today's India history.

I would really love to hear the answer of these questions from you.

Edit: She didn't answer my question yet but she answered a similar question here https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8w1kbb/_/e1sbo70 This is gold! Hey it was a very funny and wholesome thread. Thanks for doing the Ama here. You live in Pakistan or a foreign land ? And Hindi/Urdu bolni aati hai ? Have a few questions !

* Where in Pakistan you live ?
* Are you guys modern like Indians are ? Full gadgets freaks, sipping cappuccino in Starbucks slowly while reading on Kindle and reply to boyfriend's text on iPhone 10 ?
* Why ladies don't generally wear jeans or dresses etc ?
* Who is that famous chaiwala that won a modelling contract ? Can you complete the following?
Afridi chya aai chi **** How is the current political climate there? [deleted] [deleted] Sadly, the country is going to shit with the current govt. India isn‚Äôt what it used to be. If the current govt comes back to power, it would go from bad to worse.

It was great reading ALL of your answers. Thank you for the AMA. I really do hope this is not a fake account!

My question:
1. how often do the youth talk about politics? 2. What‚Äôs the Kashmir issue like to the general public? So you have read A Song of Ice and Fire. How would you rank the books in the series from most favourite to least favourite?

For me it is;

1. A storm of swords

2. A game of thrones

3. A dance of dragons

4. A clash of kings

5. A feast for crows.

 Damn a girl on reddit India and I miss out. Outta luck offline and online. Seriously I'm so sad about this irrational hatred seeded by politics between India and Pakistan. Like we're literally the same people.


Anyway, questions!

How is Pakistan for women? Many people have this impression that it's a really shit place for women.


How far do popular Islamic conservatism and sexism pervade up there? This may sound stupid, but how far are women pressured to wear burqas?


Does the average Pakistani dislike or appreciate India? Does this average person care that much about the whole Kashmir thing?


Do you consider yourself to be in the 1%? Can you talk a little about the middle class in Pakistan?


Can you talk a bit about the political situation in Pakistan completely honestly?


Since you like books, could you recommend some books for me to read? 


How far is the internet used in Pakistan? Is it widespread or elite-only?


How tf do your singers have such amazing voices. Atif Aslam is a legend.


Where do you encounter the most misogyny? Online or irl?


Is gaming a popular pastime in Pakistan as it is here? Do you game? If so, what do you play?


Is the 'Girls' School/Boys' School' thing prevalent in Pakistan as it is here to some extent?


What are some other tiny charming differences between our cultures? :D &nbsp;




Thank you for doing this ama, I've always wanted something like this! :) Not sounding creepy even though it is a creepy question but why are Pakistani women so cute ? Really dude I wonder how those cute girls ended there üò≠ What did you have for lunch today? What you think of India? Do you make your own food? Do you live with your parents?  Fuck I am late for this AMA. Can you answer these questions /u/WhereIsLordBeric 

1. Have you ever tried Ding Dong bubble gum? How were they? Their TV ad is one of the dankest thing I remember- featuring a cat who was dragged to *jungle* court by 2 lionesses because she stole their *ding dong* bubble gum.
  
2.  Are Square Cut chips similar to Lays potato chips? Their animated ad was pretty neat- a Pakistani cricket player hitting a sixer by using the *square cut* move.

3. Telefun sim card- how popular was it? Did you use it? Their animated ad was so shoddy in quality that the entire music+helpline number is still etched in my mind!
4. Ask me why and how do I know about all the stuff I mentioned above :D

Last but not the least- can I  join your Stardew Valley group?

 Have you seen any bollywood movies? If yes, which one did you like? How is life like for working women in metro cities of Pakistan? 


I loved watching zindagi Gulzar hai and hamsafar. And you guys have the best traditional fashion game! Noone does salwar kameez like you guys! :) I love your food, music, and art. 

Where do you live in Pakistan and how is life at your place? One Indian city you could live in  for the rest of your life. Can you help me get a Pakistani visa? I'm so curious about your country, only visiting it can end my curiousity. Do you like the wheel.of time series also? Are you sort of liberal or conservative? Hoping you are just an aam admi like me, what's the general perception in Pakistan about Indians?

 Furthermore, the hate based propaganda in either country stinks, what do you say? What's the one thing you feel that Pakistani people do really well that people of other nations can learn from? [deleted] If you had to recommend three pakistani movies, what would those be? God, I used to play this coke studio song to death on repeat a couple of years ago

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-S5U2GXKBSo) 1) Famous veg foods available over there ?

2) Do people also have  'log Kya Kahenge' mentality ? It runs deep in Indians and specially target towards women.

3) What do you think of women following religion considering most of religion are patriarchal in nature and always been used to control women ?

4) Do LGBT people organize Pride Parade in Pakistan ?

5) Is being atheist acceptable in Pakistani society or not ?

6) Are you from Sindh ?

I really love Karachi literature festival. They have awesome talks.    Where do you guys go on weekend trips. We Mumbai people go to Lonavala (google it), is there a similar place around Pakistani cities ? My sister is a BIG fan pakistani tv shows . She thinks they are whole lot better than indian daily soaps. Do you watch any? Is the culture totally different between two different regions (Urdu vs Punjabi speaking) like we have here, North and South India? Do you guys have OTP(one-time-password) there? I had a convo with a Pakistani gal 1-2 years back, she was clueless about it. Are you familiar with girlsatdhabas? What do you think of their initiative?  1. What's your beauty routine?
2. Do you have long hair? If so, do you henna it?
3. Epilators or wax? Not every Indian hate Pakistan or Pakistanis. What's about you guys/girls? Do most of you hate us like the media portrays?  Have you heard of or read Ibn-e-Safi?

As a kid I used to read his spy-thrillers (translated in Hindi) and loved them. Hi There,
Greetings, 

Could you refer some books referring the history of Pakistan. I already know the from the Indian Perspective and i feel a lot of people/Facts have been omitted.

Just one example i know of are the Ali Brothers who have been mentioned of significant importance for the Islamic community in Gandhi Book ""My Experiments with the truth during the Freedom Movement""

Would love to know how its been stated from Pakistan perspective.


Peace Take care.

Would love to visit and explore Pakistan one day(before i die). What kind of clothes do you wear 

A.  At work

B. At home 

C.  While out for shopping.   Are people there also told ""go back to India"", if they say something 'anti-national'? Do you think winds of winter will ever release? [deleted] Dude you just became popular üòÇ What are some pakistani songs that you love to hear? (Don't forget to share ghazals) (Political) How has the perception of India amongst your age group and or peers changed in the past few years?  Are didi apki shaadi ho gayi ? Waha pe Mobile data ke plans kaise hai ? Yaha pe ab bahut sasta ho gya hai saare pakistani eese kiyu baat krte hein In case you're still answering:

1. How do you guys generally hang out with friends, partners, colleagues?

2. Sorry for the naivety (or if this is offensive), do you have bars? or just coffee or hukka joints?

3. ~~I saw 'Khuda Key Liye' and absolutely loved it. Any other stuff would you recommend?~~

4. Whats your take on Indian music? Is Bollywood as popular there as we think it is?

5. Do you know much about Indian film-stars? If yes, what would your kill, marry, hookup choices be?

Edit: saw the AMA chain, got answer to 3, unless you have a non-Punjabi film in place of Zinda Bhaag to recommend. what is the stance of women in Pak army? Does the Pakistan Punjab suffer from the same pesticide and farmer debt/suicide issue that occurs on the Indian side? Also, in that region do most people consider themselves as Pakistani or Punjabi if asked about their nationality? Is Urdu more widely spoken or Punjabi? pakistan may life kaise hai A Pakistani woman on reddit wow even my super nerdy friends don't use Reddit I am an Indian living in India, AMA about Pakistan. Why can't pakistani's cook vegetables without meat, why does it have to Aloo Gosht, Dal Gosht, Palak Gosht, Aravi Gosht, Tinda Gosht ? How do I lose my virginity? [deleted] [deleted] Which side of Pakistan are you from?

What's the reason and extent forb the hate Punjabis and Pashtuns have against each other?

P.S ; You're welcome to post on /r/IndiansGoneWild. We won't hold your nationality against you What do you look for in a guy ? What do Pakistanis think of South Indians? [removed] [removed]",2018-07-05 02:47:08

I am Tathagata Satpathy, elected Member of Parliament and Chief Whip of Biju Janata Dal in Lok Sabha. This is the 4th time I am serving as an MP (12th, 14th, 15th & 16th Lok Sabha). I am a journalist by profession and I am the editor of two newspapers, Dharitri (Oriya) and Orissa POST (English).

[AMA Proof image]( http://imgur.com/rrdJgI9)

At the outset, I would like to tell you why I am doing this AMA. This young man /u/kumbhakaran (*I wonder why but he prefers not to be named*) who works with me and helps me with my legislative work requested me to do this. I agreed. 

After hearing about this AMA format of interaction, I thought it would be a good way to know what people think of the present situation in India. Your questions might be a link to finding solutions to issues that are uppermost in the minds of people of a certain creed. 

Being selfish, I would like to use these inputs sometime in Parliament. I am not sure how this could help improve the overall situation (or solve problems) but Reddit could prove to be an alternative communication channel for me. I am not on Twitter or Facebook. I like the anonymity that Reddit offers. Therefore I have dared to do this AMA here.

My policy team, /u/kumbhakaran and /u/ZainabHameed, will be helping me with this AMA. They will also participate and respond.

**BIG DISCLAIMER: The views expressed in this AMA should definitely not be attributed to those of my party and leadership. I am answering these questions as a citizen of India. All views expressed here are personal. Same goes for my staff.**

So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india community. 

*I will start answering questions at 7 pm (IST).*

EDIT (20:01 IST): Thank you Redditors for participating in my AMA and a special thank you to the moderators. If some of you still have queries, please do post them. I will try to answer them sometime during this week. Don't be surprised if you find me as a regular Redditor after this. Amen!

EDIT (19:53 IST, March 20, 2015): I got some brilliant points from Redditors regarding the plight of the farming sector. Yesterday, I had allotted the time of the BJD to a colleague who unfortunately, did not use them. I spoke today (limited party time) and used some of the points in the House. /u/kumbhakaran has uploaded the video already! After a not so busy week in parliament, let me try answering a few more questions.
",tathagatasatpathy," Hello.
It's good to see an Indian MP doing something like an AMA.
I would like to ask you what your personal opinion is about SC/ST reservations in political, professional and educational institutions. 
Do you think they still have any relevance, or has the time for them passed, and they are just being misused now? Do you think parties should reveal all data related to their funding? Thank you for this AMA, sir.

1. I read your [insightful article](http://tathagatasatpathy.com/web/Epidemic.aspx) about the spread of Jaundice in Orissa. There has been much research that uses mobile phone cameras to detect Jaundice, and many apps for doing this have been developed in western countries (predominantly for detecting Jaundice in infants). Some of us would like to work with the health ministry to develop these for India. How can we reach out to them?
1. Do you think that the short-term social ills that can arise from deregulation (like agitation among farmers and tribals) are worth it for the potential long-term benefits? To this end, what are your views on the Land Acquisition Bill?
1. The GDP of Mumbai is more than the GDP of the entire state of Orissa. Orissa has much untapped economic potential (tourism, food processing and manufacturing). Yet, governments in the state have not focused on significant pro-growth reforms - regardless of political affiliation. Why do you think that is the case?

Again, thank you very much for doing this AMA. I hope your example is followed by more legislators in the country. Hi, I am from your constituency. I live in Caltex square area. 

I wanted to ask that [last year the government announced a special job fair](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bhubaneswar/Students-in-a-fix-over-deferred-dates-for-job-fair-many-cancel-reservations/articleshow/42330062.cms) for unemployed technical and management graduates. 100 INR was collected from each interested student. About 3 lakh students registered as of final count. But, the job fair never took place. Can you tell us what happened to the money?
 What is your party's take on Cannabis decriminalization?  How do you balance editing 2 newspapers and being an MP? How different is the 16th Lok Sabha when compared to 14th and 15th? Better or worse in terms of efficiency of getting bills passed, the general behavior and attitude? Hello Sir,
An article on front page of New Indian express says despite spending crores the state continues to be in the grip of dreaded malaria. Odisha tops the country in incidence of malaria (36% of the whole country). Odisha is also third in terms of malaria deaths. How is the state government going to tackle this problem?

BJD had walked out of the Lok Sabha when  Land Acquisition Bill was passed. Specific to Odisha what are the issues BJD finds in the bill ?

Naveen Patnaik had written to PM to re-examine coal block earmarking process. Again specific to Odisha what issues BJD finds in the coal auction process ? Hello Mr.Sathpathy it is great to have you with us. 

I will come straight to the point. So here are my questions:-

Q1 Last November you spoke about Black Money and said ""Governance and Government do not change according to the political party"" Is this also applicable to your party i.e. BJD which is in the Government in Odisha?

Q2 In 2014 General Elections Narendra Modi's juggernaut swept almost the entire country but not Odisha. Their BJD won 20 out of 21 LS seats. How did your party manage that? 

Q3. When you were speaking on Land Acquisition act you said "" Nation wants to know"". A MP behind you was quick to point out the journalist with whom this phrase is associated. How often does such funny incidents happen in the house?

Q4 What will be your advice for young people like me who want to come into politics? 

Q5 and last question When are we going to see a BJP-BJD alliance again? :P >So go ahead and Ask Me Anything! This is only the beginning of my dialogue with the /r/india[6] community. 

Glad to hear that Sir. This is a special opportunity for many of us (one that we might not get later on, so I know that I wish to juice as much info/views i can get out of you).

----

You've been the representative for Dhenkanal for the last 11 years.

* 2014: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2009: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal
* 2004: Tathagata Satapathy, Biju Janata Dal

**1)** What according to you have you done in the past 11 years for your constituency? And what have you done for the rest? (Please provide sources if u can)

----

**2)** In India atleast, LS RS proceedings tend to be a noisy situation where many politicians engage in hooliganism. Most practically scream at the top of their lungs, disregarding everything anybody has to say. There are many other incidences that just sounds pathetic. IMO (In my opinion) and I'm pretty sure many agree with me on this, It feels pretty sad to see something like this happening. I assume its supposed to show that the politicians are fighting hard for the people they represent, but to many (even if they support our own beliefs) it just looks like the politicians are shutting down every other other views. LS and RS are places where each of the points are supposed to be thoroughly vetted and debated. Screaming helps no one (IMO). Similar to parties walking out. I know its part of tactics where a certain group wants show protest, but not want to disturb political deals. Why can't they have a separate flag that just say they should not be counted while still listening to all sides of the story and participating in the debate instead of walking out on every thing? **What are your views about this?**

----

**3)** What are the challenges that you have faced (not political parties) that have impeded you in your efforts?

----

**4)** If you could create a law that would be implemented (that isn't already), what would that be?

----

**5)** How long do you think will it take for debates raging online to have a VERY sizeable impact in real life politics.

----

**6)** What are your views on the bad Maoist situation in Orissa? Do you feel sections of the proper Indian Military (not CRPF), and Air force needs to be brought in to deal with the Maoist problems?

----

**7)** How would you rate the practices taken by the Orissa government to boost Industries and Industrial growth?

----

**8)** Who do you think acts like an Idiot the most in the LS (in terms of impeding the processes of the LS)

----

**9)** How do you think that being the editor of your own newspaper has helped you in your personal and political endeavours.

----

**10)** Call out some of the bad practices of BJD, or acts that you don't like/support.

----
**11)** Personal question: I've identified myself as a gamer (computer gamer) when i was younger. I still do (but not professionally now due to familial pressure). We see tournaments such as the DOTA2 international which gives out prize money of about (67 crores ->in comparison IPL prize pool was about 25 crores), and many other such for a large number of games. The chances of earning good amounts of money in playing computer & console games on a competitive level is far higher than in most other sports, with a very large audience. And even in case we can't make it to the big league, streaming pays a lot of money. Yet everyone from the government at best does not do much to stop them and at worst erects barrier after barrier to stop people from playing. This is in addition to the bad rep that gaming already has. Many other countries have started organizations to help its citizens in their ordeals - (Especially in terms of procurement of visa etc) Korea, malaysia, China, Canada, America (in the process of creating one). Why hasn't our government even recognized it as a sport?

----

**12)** India is considered as one of the most trigger happy countries in terms of censorship. What are your opinions about that and also in terms of privacy concerns being raised.

***Please answer what you can. Thanks. And Please don't skip the entire thing if you don't want to answer a few of them*** 1) What is the cause of widespread poverty in Odisha even when it is fairly rich in natural resources ?

2) What were other reasons behind BJD-BJP split apart from what was shown in news ?

3) How do you manage to win in a large state like Odisha ? Family name or actual ground work. If latter, any examples ?

4) Are there any people in BJD who want to expand outside Odisha or wish a new BJD-BJP alliance or with any other party ? What is party's official stand ?

5) Compared to rest of CMs, ~~Biju~~ Naveen keeps a low profile and we rarely hear anything about Odisha apart from natural calamities. Reason ?  Thank you so much for doing this AMA, sir.

1) What are the major challenges you see in front of your state right now?

2) How do you rate the current central government? What are the things you like/dislike/want them to do? Specifically, please comment on your stand over the controversial land acquisition act.

Edit: [Your Wikipedia page](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tathagata_Satapathy) says you've spoken against religious conversions. What, in your view, can be done to stop the constant flow of money into the country for missionary work?  Hello, thank you for this AMA, Sir.

Odisha, being part of the ""Red Corridor"" has faced a lot of **Naxalite-Maoist insurgencies** lately.

 What are the reasons that lead people to join them? What are the challenges in dealing with them? And should the Central Government pay *more* attention to this situation than before? And, in your opinion, how should this be dealt with? Thank you so much for doing this AMA, sir.

What are your views on Right to education act with respect to its  quality control and minority exemption aspect? I think this is interesting because of your relative disconnect from the whole NDA-UPA war: what is the BJD's main ideological contentions against the opposition in Orissa? Thanks for doing this AMA. I think it is a great initiative.

Who are your friends in the parliament, MPs that you enjoy having a conversation with? Thank you for doing this AMA. We, at reddit, are very excited about this AMA because you are the first politician to do an AMA on reddit.

1. Whenever someone dies in natural disaster, or accident and mishap, and gets a lot of media attention, Shri Naveen Pattanaik, announces a hefty sum for the victim or their family. This is something he does a lot. My question is, how is it justified? There are a lot of other people whose story don't get media attention and suffer a lot and get no government aid. How is it justified to spend hard working tax-payers money for some victims personally rather than building roads, street lights, water, etc that benefits the whole community? Being a resident of Orissa, I want to know.

2. What is your opinion on net neutrality? Hello sir, welcome to Reddit.

I read your paper, Dharitri. I like the cartoons very much. Please give my regards to the cartoonist. Also, please consider translating the cartoons into English and publishing them in your English paper. I bet they will be popular.

Some cartoons for my fellow Redditors:

**Source:** [Dharitri](http://www.dharitri.com/) (in Odia) Thank you for this AMA sir. 

What do you think of the RTI act and the issue of political parties coming under it? AAP and LSP both voluntarily disclose sources of funds and have accepted RTI for political parties. Both issues are separate but are also linked by transparency.  Sir, congratulations on being the first elected representative from India to do AMA. Lots of respect! Sincerely wish you all the good luck. 

My question is- does being an MP interfere with your editorial responsibilities? Or vice-versa? How do you sort your time?   Sir, Namaskar!! Thank you for doing this AmA!!

1. My first question is perhaps one of my most important ones. But it needs a bit of a backstory... I divided them into points:
  *  All across the world, there are  [makerspaces, and hackerspaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace), which breed innovation in the local community. These ""spaces"" are built with one single purpose *Community participation and Building stuff!!* And they are open to everyone! Even you could visit [one of these spaces](http://www.hackerspaces.org/) and they will welcome you and allow you to build stuff with their equipments. Sometimes new and successful companies are made in those places(Makerbot, etc.). 
  * I see many ministers from Odisha telling that, the state can be a ""Manufacturing hub"" but when it comes to walking the plank, they only focus on the software aspect of things. Infosys, Wipro, etc.
  * Also, the whole mentality of people family, neighbours, shopkeepers is being more or less dismissive about those students/kids who want to build something based on their subject. And the only time they build something is if it is a competition. This drives up prices in the competitions/projects seasons and shopkeepers take full advantage of this.
   * Yes, India is the land of jugaad! And yes, we have IITs who produce entrepreneurs but *How can ministers/people expect MOST students who have little or no knowledge and experience of actually building/making things to come forward and start a manufacturing company?*  
 
 **What do you think can be done to change this thinking about MAKING/BUILDING(and move away from rote based method of learning) and encourage hackerspaces in India(and especially in our state)?**


2. As a engineering student, I see a certain lack of standards in India. One does not simply walk into a hardware store and ask""Bhai, give me Pozidrive screws with XYZ pitch"" and expect them to understand. But this is not just in hardware. Even there's a lack of Environmental standards and you might have heard about ""Car Safety Tests"" being brought in just now, only after there was a growing public anger about Road Safety. I think it's because of not including R&D in all spheres of policymaking. **Why do you think there's a certain lack of standards in India? What can be done about it?**

3. When I was a kid I could watch many cartoons and from different countries and in many languages. These days they are full of mythology and really crappy animation techniques. All due respect to Indian mythology, but why should you prevent kids from watching cartoons from different countries in their formative years. It's not  that they won't like Indian mythology in the future. Over the years, my respect for Indian mythology has grown and I believed they should be shown as cartoons. But no like this.... to drive TRPs and just for the sake of it. **What do you think about kids' cartoons being inundated with Indian mythology just for the sake of putting mythology in front of them?** 

4.  Given the state of driving abilities of people in India. **What is the state and central government doing to train drivers to drive safely? What measures can we adopt to prevent drivers from absconding after a hit-and-run case?** I read somewhere, *Driving in India is like playing a video game, except it's more stressful and when there's a 'Game Over'. It really is GAME OVER, for you.*

5. **What do you think about the current Internet speeds in India? Also what are your views on Government bans and Net Neutrality?**


I hope you answer my questions...

""And Mr. Satpathy, welcome to Reddit"" I learn everyday and I'm glad I was today introduced to a man who is a well deserving political leader motivated to serve the people he represents. I wish you the very best in all your endeavours!

I have no speficic questions for you, unfortunately. 

Please accept my congratulations for being holistic, humble and not the typical 'stereotype of a neta'. India has a lot of netas, I have a small running list of good ones and might I say with humility that you are on it and I'm likely to stalk you and your success going forward :)

Love from Bangalore. My background is Pakistani, I now proudly call Canada my home. But seeing an Indian MP engage in this way is all sorts of epic, and the frankness of this discussion is something to be admired. I hope politicians from all around the world engage more with their constituents in a variety of ways the way Mr. Satpathy has done so. And I definitely think that Pakistani politicians have a lot to learn from their Indian counterpart. Thank you for doing this. My questions.

**1)** The centre announced that the funds from the coal block allocations would go to the states. The media reported that Odisha would also be benefited. How much do you think will the auction of coal blocks in Odisha fetch?

**2)** How does your government plan to use these funds?

**3)** From a completely objective and non-political perspective, what do you think are the problems Odisha faces now?

**4)** How long do you think will it take for Odisha to rank among the top states on parameters such as HDI,literacy rate etc.?

**5)** We've seen that various states such as J&K, Chattisgarh and UP are taking steps to encourage tourism. Why doesn't your government do so too? Why do we not see any ads on Odisha? Hey /u/kumbhakaran, thumbs up for talking /u/tathagatasatpathy into doing this :) Tathagat, you're a sport! Hope you have fun with this and decide to do it again. Here goes:

What do you think about junking the use of the salutation ""Hon'ble"" when referring to MPs. Will be refreshing after 60+ years of disgusting sycophancy, don't you think?

What's your favourite rock album? Hi Sir. Thank you for doing this: it's such a great initiative. My questions are:

1. In the light of AAP sweeping polls in the recent past, and the many controversies that have started surrounding it after it came on power, what is your take on this whole AAP phenomenon? Do you think Kejriwal's view of politics is viable in today's political scenario?

and 2.What are the issues that we as a country need to focus on right now?

Thanks once again for doing this. I hope it encourages more politicians to have open discussions with their electorates.  I want to know only two things:

What internet speed do you get at your home?

Can you help India get 50Mbps average speed by 2017?

If so, please do, as fast internet means fast access to info. and lead to increase in productivity Hello, sir.
I want to ask you what your take is on the women's safety situation.
Do you think the government is doing enough to remedy the situation? 
How is the scenario in Odisha? Is the state government taking any initiatives there? It is not satisfactory in respect of supply of piped drinking water to rural villagers of Odisha. Odisha Government is not providing electricity charges and honorarium to the pump operators of the rural water supply as per recent RWSS notification. What steps you have taken being an MP to facilitate the people of Odisha to provide free piped water supply to the villagers of Odisha? How many months of the year is /u/kumbhakaran asleep? Do you have anyone else to work with you when he is asleep?
 Ok, this is officially the coolest AMA here till date. Hands down. Came here being a cynic, but there is hope in politics! Mr Satpathy, 

I have been a fan of your mother and in my opinion her sidelining by state leaders sowed the seed of downfall of Congress. What are your thoughts on that ? 

*  How do you feel the role of opposition in democracy. 

*  In Odisha there has been next to no opposition for the last decade. Is it making BJD administration complacent ?
* Navin Pattnaik Has tremendous goodwill both inside and outside state and is almost the most recognised campaigner for the party. Does the party have a backup plan in case he decides to or has to stepdown? 
 Congratulations on being one of the first states to pass the Lokayukta bill. Have you seen any noticeable improvements after the bill?

Orissa is closer to the BIMARU states in terms of economic performance. What are your short term and long term plans to transform Orissa into one of the better performing states in the country? A question.

Your party had been with the NDA for over 15 years. Then broke away before the 2009 elections. Then for some reason Naveen Patnaik was nomcomittal about NDA/UPA in the run up to 2014 elections and finally said he was disturbed by the idea of Modi as PM.

Finally Modi won anyway, and since then your party has been sending mixed signals, from the CM visiting the PM with all his MPs in tow for support last year to more recently your party blocking legislation and disrupting the Parliament.

Beyond political interests, what exactly is your goal here? [deleted] Why is your state one of the most backward in the country? 1. Do you have a research staff to write your speeches? Do all MPs have a team? How can one be a part of it?

2. Do MPs actually spend time reading and researching the bills before going to Parliament?

TIA. Why did you join politics? My questions would be a little unorthodox (for lack of a better word):

1. Are you proud to be an Indian (in the 21^st century)? If so, why? 

1. Are you a religious person? Do you believe in God? Would you describe yourself as a strictly *logical* person?

1. How would you rate Indian economy today in comparison to rest of the BRICS nations? And why?

1. Do you think more about the state, or the constituency you represent or *the Nation* as a whole? Please explain why?

1. Do you think you are a truly neutral person w.r.t your party? Do you think true neutrality exists?

1. On Mar 2^nd, 2015 - BJD sought *President's intervention* and dubbed Modi government 'anti-people', how do you explain this? What was the *overriding* need to denounce the duly elected government of India like this? Do you think attaching such *sensationalist* labels on *our* central government helps your cause?

1. Naveen Patnaik recently asked BJD MPs to **oppose** Modi government. 

 Do you really **think**, at a time, when we, as a nation, are in dire need of crucial reforms, social change and *rapid* economic development, resisting the *central government* at *every* step of the way is *conducive* for our nation?

1. If you feel discriminated against, there are various forums to take the matter up and make it known but to *dogmatically* oppose the government, is it the *most healthy* way to go about solving the problem?

1. How much would you say nepotism is *prevalent* in your party? 

1. Is there any `law` against `noise pollution` in Odisha? Speaking from my recent experience in Bhubaneshwar, the Police-officers, *even* after several noise complaints, don't take any serious action against *irresponsible* all night *public* use of Microphones and Loudspeakers which continues for consecutive nights in festive seasons. Why aren't `Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000` enforced in Odisha? What is your take on NetNeturality are you going to support it.
http://savetheinternet.in What do your fellow party members feel about this AMA? Do you think it could backfire?  Thank you for your participation.

1) Who are your favorite political cartoonists in Orissa? 

2) Does Orissa need a metro?

3) What steps have been taken to prevent oil spills like the one in 2009?

4) How are the Kosli people being helped - do you have a feeling that Orissa has only stolen from them?
 Hello sir. Orissa has been one of the biggest beneficiary of recent coal auctions how does the state plan to spend that money.  Orissa is a major beneficiary in the recent coal allocations. State share in central taxes pool has also gone up by 10%

Does your government have a plan to spend this extra money? Do you see this additional money contributing to a tangible improvement in Infrastructure or Social indicators in state? What do you do to unwind from work and stress? [deleted] Mr. Satpathy, do you have children? If yes, do they study in government schools or private ones?

What about the children of other politicians'/ministers' children?

PS: I'm from Bihar, and every minister's child studies in some posh school or the other. What's your opinion on Section 153A & 295A of IPC, 144 of CrPC and 66A of IT Act? All of them killing our freedoms. Pardon me but I have another question. I'm a BJP supporter but I've always had admiration for Naveen Patnaik. I appreciate that rather than jumping the secular/communal bandwagon based on how many seats the BJP has(like other parties) he has remained equidistant to both BJP and Congress and even kept out of initiatives like the Janata Parivar's caste based alliance.

Do you think Naveen Patnaik would be a good PM. Has he ever expressed such ambitions to your knowledge? Sir what's your stand on crypto-currency? I have heard you mentioning bitcoin but it was not clear whether you support or oppose it.  Thanks for doing Mr.Satpathy! I already enjoyed reading all your responses. Can you share with us a couple of stories? Your biggest achievement since you got elected, however big or small that is.And your biggest disappointment in political career.Finally, what do you think we need to do to get rid of the inertia in politics and elect individuals who are more interested in dialogue with the citizens, like you seem to be! Hi sir,
You told that you are happy that  after 9 and a 1/2 years Vedanta and posco could not acquire land as our chief minister's eye on ground and heart with the people. and again you are not anti development. Then how do you think that we can use our minerals and get benefited from it ? Dear Mr Satpathy , 

Firstly i must congratulate you for taking this bold step. It is a much needed change in the mindset of politicians. 

Now coming to my questions : 

1- As an industrialist my self , i get a strong feeling that the policies and the policy makers simply do not want the Primary revenue generating industries of Orissa i.e. Steel , Mining , Power etc to grow. The same can be seen in the current position of all these industries where they are just merely surviving to live another day. What do you have to say about the anti indutry sentiments in the state ? 

2- The Orissa Govt. has big plans for infrastructural growth (Roads, Rural Electrification, water supplies, providing huge subsidies etc.) , now all the plans are welcomed by the citizens of Orissa. My only concern is how do you plan to fund all these schemes when the major revenue generating industries have been forced to shut down  and your tax collections in the form of Sales Tax , Royalties etc have hit an all time low?

3- And lastly , when will the great leaders at Bhubaneshwar realise that all the projects have to be equally distributed all over Orissa for a fair growth of the state and it is not just Bhubaneshwar City that needs all the Medical Colleges / Road Projects / Engineering Colleges / Airports / State of the Art Bus Stands etc to name a few. 

(I hope while answering you'll truly reflect and come out with an extensive plan to elevate the poor living standard of Odisha.)          Hello, /u/tathagatasatpathy[1]  . India already produces a lot of food to sustain the population and also export at the same time. Our problem is storage and distribution. Steel or concrete grain silos are probably the best and easiest way to store grains until distribution, gunny sacks promote moisture, which in turn attracts fungi and bacteria which spoils the grains or rodents which finish off the grains.

Grain silos are such an simple answer to a huge problem the Govt. is facing in terms of storage, yet why hasn't there been any initiative to switch from gunny bags? Thank you mr Tathagata Satpathy, for doing this ama, I wanted to ask other than the lamp fellowship,is there anyway a pleb or a noob can get an oppurtunity to  intern under a MP, the lamp fellowship is a  good program but are there any short term internships that MP can provide?








Also do you watch house of cards, how murky is our system



edit:


also 1 more question, your views on subramanium swamy? any plans to make orissa into some kind of hub aiming to make life of orissa better? Thanks for the AMA, Sir.

What are your views for bringing political parties under RTI ? 1-Are you in favour of banning things like beef or porn?

2-Do you think Porn must be legalized? yes/no?why?

3-What is your opinion on caste based reservation? Should it be removed yes/no? why?

4-Will you support UCC?

5-What is your opinion on LGBT rights?

6-Do you think that AYUSH must be banned till they go under same scrutiny as Evidence based medicine undergoes?

7- How much are you in favour of keeping religion separate from state(govt)?

8-Free speech. Do you think that right to offend must come in free speech clause?
 Evening Mr. Satpathy, 

I hope you will understand that this is a place with polarizing political views. And things will go to the boiling point very quickly. People bitch about other parties all the time and you won't be an exception. In that vein, let's get started. Shall we?

1) Land ordinance - I watched your speech. Nice; perhaps you should try to assert yourself more in critical junctures. Anyway, in this subreddit, there is a feeling that *oh 4x compensation, farmers should accept, industrialization is the only mean to get India out of poverty and all*. I don't fully subscribe with this view. Industrialization is very important, if 19 million boys and girls enter the labour force every year, you - as policymakers - should and must try to provide jobs. 

**Can you please explain to the urban folks like us why this land ordinance is one of the gravest pieces of legislatures ever?** In your speech you said about entities - not enterprises - getting land. If I draw a hyperbole, I fear that Mukesh Ambani will create an one man subsidiary and get the land. You also touched the point of SIA or Social Impact Assessment. What about that? You didn't touch the point of entities not needing to give back the land after 5 years, as that was present in earlier land bill. 

2) Now that I and you despise this land ordinance, but at the same time, want jobs to grow and economy to grow - not by fueled by IMF money - what other modes of industrialization do we have? I would want to draw your attention here - http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2z3qkx/r_adani_might_be_the_worst_company_ever/cpfgd82

Assuming that poster is not a blind Modi fan - hell think that that poster is someone you work with -  how you would dissuade his fear?

3) A good number of participants here live in gated communities, read Times of India and argue in Internet. As P. Sainath had said in one of his lectures - 'what kind of society we are building?' - reference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q6m5NgrCJs

What can we do to help create a more equitable society?

4) On a longer note, do you think media will be Murdocized and Indian media would be Ambanized - as the great Vinod Mehta described? Why the hell, you guys are not pushing for the bill that prevents cross ownership of media? You are even a reporter - thoughts?

5)  Why don't you push for a legislation that prevents the bullshit, fairness cream advertisements which have no scientific backing and causes gullible Indians to fall into the 'fair complexion' trap? 

6) Please push for an amendment of the IT act. If you push that, you will be a hall of fame hero in this area of Internet. 

7) Lots of other questions. But kya apke toothpaste ke namak hain? Aur kya apka masudo pe dard hain?

Sorry I had to ask all those :) Stay good Sir, stay good.  Hello Sir, Kemiti Achhanti?

a. Why does the parliament keeps increasing MPs salary by voting for themselves. There is never an opposition to these bills unlike Janlokpal or womens reservation bill. Do you think its justified?

b. How is the quality of those super duper ultra cheap samosas in the parliament canteen?

c. Isn't supporting Naveen Patnaik after Biju Patnaik just another dynastic political scenario?   
  
Today Naveen Patnaik may be one of the better CMs around, but back when Biju Patnaik's successor was being searched for, and Naveen was a novice, what political qualifications were considered to establish that Naveen was the right person for the job?

Thank you in advance!
 Hello sir, thanks a lot for doing this AMA.

I'd like to know your opinion about perks offered to the members of parliament. I looked at a few online sources and found out that Indian MPs enjoy many allowances and perks, some of them are-

> - Daily allowance of Rs. 2,000 for attending parliament.

> - Nearly 50,000 units of free electricity every year.

> - Three phone line with 170,000 free local calls every year.

> - Free business class air tickets for official tour + travelling allowance depending upon the country visited.

> - Complete maintenance of MP's resident is done by government.

All those different perks and allowances add up to a total of nearly **35 lakhs**. Do you think it is justified to offer so many perks and allowances to MPs while most of the country still suffers from poverty? Don't you think some of the allowances should be reconsidered and brought down to a realistic amount? Or at least there should be a government body which ensures that these funds are actually used to serve people and not for personal use? What are your views on 3-D printing tech (reprap 3-D printers), Raspberry Pi and other open technologies?

Don't you think it would be amazing if our kids learn these technologies from the very beginning?

How many MPs are aware of the amazing implications of these technologies and are doing something to promote them? Why aren't we embracing more open tech in our schools/government instead of signing huge contracts with Microsoft? This is  the best AMA yet,  thankyou mods Hello sir, it is good to see someone take such an initiative!
How is your relationship with Naveen Patnaik? 
Is he a good leader according to your political sensibilities? Thank you for the AMA sir, I read about your reply in 2006 on reservation system of backward classes and must say it was really a great opinion raising some very valid points.
What are your views about the Land acquisition act? Which is your favorite book and which are you reading now? Sir, it is a well known fact that a state that gets a good representation in the national cabinet (key ministerial posts, etc) gets more incentives. Now given that your party once had an alliance with BJP at state level, and now that BJP is in power at the centre, would it have been better if BJD had joined NDA so as to improve the conditions of Odisha? (I want to cite a comment made by a forum memeber here regarding Odisha being the ""Andaman of mainland""). 

Thank you. Mr Sathpathy,

Thank you for doing this AMA. 

1. Can you tell us what plans and suggestions you endorse for creating jobs in odisha and nationwide ?

2. Since your party is primarily a regional one, can you tell us why people from other regions should bother about it ?

3. What do you feel are the top 5 issues which are amenable to government/political intervention ? i.e. What do you feel the top priorities should be ?

4. What are the best avenues you recommend for reducing corruption and increasing probity and transparency in public life ? How best to increase realistic idealism ?

 Sir
I know you fought against reservations.
Q1: What are doing further fighting against the bill
Q2: Do you think reservations are relevant today. If yes or no why?
Q3: Even if you are for the reservation or against it, it has to be removed eventually. How do you propose to do that and most important does anyone in indian politics have courage enough to do it
Thanks The views of children (defined as citizens below the age of 18) are not adequately represented in our present form of government. Nor are they allowed to participate as much as would have been practically possible. I myself (17yo) have felt left out a lot of times in the past few years. I wish to help the world around me, and start early too. But I am unable to do that. 

What are your views on this, and would you like to do something for this problem? If so, how?

What is your opinion on lowering the age of majority?

I appreciate it that you've taken time out of your schedule to answer our questions today. Thank you! The Law Commission submitted its latest report a couple of days ago & one of its major recommendations was an audit of the accounts of political parties by CAG mandated auditors. What is your party's stand on greater transparency in political funding?  Sir
there are further Q's
1. As someone said there is natural wealth in Odisha which has not yet been utilized.
2. There is tremendous scope for tourism (like Goa Kerala Maharashtra MP etc) which has not been utilised.
3. Why are people in odisha so uneducated.
4. Tsunamis are frequent. Why not go for one time solution like wave breakers and mangroves. which is easily achieved and save crores of property every year.
5. Why CRZ regulations are flauted in Odisha
6. There are several redevelopment projects proposed by BDA, why not for other areas of Odisha
7. There is a lot of scope to develop the economy of Odisha, what is hampering it Which politician do you admire the most? Hello sir. I first want to congratulate your government on passing the [Anti-Witchhunt Law](http://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/odisha-assembly-passes-anti-witch-hunting-bill-113120501161_1.html). It took a lot of legal battles from my fellow rationalists in Odisha to draw the attention to the issue.

Second, I believe that Odia people are a very peaceful people, who believe in live and let live. There are not many religious fundamentalist movements in the state. I was disappointed to see the rises in attacks on Valentine's Day in [Bhubaneswar](http://www.business-standard.com/article/news-ians/moral-policing-mars-valentine-s-day-celebrations-in-odisha-115021401058_1.html) and smaller cities like Rourkela. Please, check these fundamentalists. They tarnish a region's image and discourage investors.

Thirdly, what is your take on the [IIM site issue](http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-odisha-state-government-recommends-iim-at-sambalpur-2065535)? I think Bhubaneswar is only site that is fulfilling that criteria set by the Centre. The state BJP is intentionally raking up the issue. They don't actually have the people's interest in mind. Although, if centre makes the requirement lower, I think the IIM should be allowed in western Odisha. Bhubaneswar already has 30+ colleges and IIT, IIIT, AIIMS etc. Sir, do you think we can ever completely rid our government of corruption?  What is your opinion on the use of Eminent Domain? I think it should be used for roads, highways, railways, ports. And even there, only where it's the only option available. I am absolutely against use of Eminent Domain for factories, industries, schools and what not. What is your opinion?  

I enjoyed watching your speech on the mining bill.

 Hello Mr. Sathpathy, I am sorry I am not quite aware of your party's views on the recent land acquisition bill. 

A related question would be, a lot of villagers and tribals have been protesting against the BJD government backed land acquisition
by POSCO for quite some time now. How do you plan to arrive at a quick solution without compromising these villagers' daily livelihood? What actions are needed in Orissa to meet the growing demand for specialised skills which will be required by industries in coming years?

Does the govt have any programme in place? Does it need any support in terms of expertise in manufacturing automation.  Who has been your ideal? Did it change over time since childhood?

And let it be an honest answer, and not a ""nice sounding answer"" that make you look better (Everyone knows what that answer is, the great you_know_who). 

Speaking for myself, I'd much rather accept an unexpected answer than the typical and dishonest answer. 



 How do you deal with working within a party structure? 

There are elements within every political party that are not entirely clean. However in India, politicians rarely speak out against fellow party-members or assert an individual agenda in terms of legislation. So this raises a natural question about a politician's integrity i.e. even if you are personally clean yourself, keeping quiet about certain corrupt elements/adopting stands against personal beliefs for the good of the party creates an obvious contradiction. Do you grapple with such questions? Or do you think it is not a concern at all and everyone you know in your party is honest and doing a good job? Hello Mr. Satpathy,

   1. Don't You think the media today has become very biased with most of the press and news channels being overtly or covertly associated with political parties and them acting as mouthpieces, more so in the case of press? What do you think can be made to make the media and press more unbiased and accountable?

 2. There have been observations of the quality of discussions in the Parliament deteriorating over the last few years, what in your opinion needs to be done to make them more fruitful?

  3. With so many disruptions in both the houses, don't you think this will give the government all the more reason to promulgate ordinances there by subverting the Parliament? 

  4. How do you think the MPs disrupting the houses can be made accountable for the disruptions? 

  5. Shouldn't there be a guideline on the minimum amount of time for discussions and debates with a provision to extend the sessions in case of loss of hours to adjournment. What's your take on ministers with pending criminal cases not allowed to contest elections?  Sir i would like to know what is your take on India's international policies. How is the internal democracy in the BJD? How are the voices of dissent addressed? I had visited Orissa years ago, as a tourist, and loved it. Living in metro India we often forget how beautiful the people outside the big cities are. Konark & Puri were a truly memorable experience. I love your state and its food (some of the best prawns I've ever had)

I think people of Orissa don't get their due in the national dialogue which is driven by Delhi / Maha / UP / Bihar / Bengal / TN / Punjab. 

The current government seems to be making a deeper push for federalism. What are your thoughts on this? Hi, this has been one great AMA.On a tangent your name is unique, tathagata is generally a mahayana buddhist name for enlightened fellow in 'suchness', any story regarding how you got this name? You are one cool ass politician Sir, you being a journalist yourself, what is your opinion on freedom of speech in the country, especially on the internet (with respect to Section 66A of the Information Technology Act)? What do you think about internet censorship and spying. Do we have an NSA equivalent here in India. I will be very suprised if our government is not collecting data of its citizens, considering Modi and Shah ji are not some kind of monks to stay away from these dirty tricks to have power grabs. What is your take on the impact of [Dharma Port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhamra_Port) construction which would impact one of the largest breeding grounds  of [Olive Ridley turtles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olive_ridley_sea_turtle#Nesting_grounds) ?
I understand that infrastructure development is an important aspect for a developing nation, but does it have to come at a price of destroying/ risking creatures that don't have a vote of their own ?
Or does a creature need to be majestic like the Indian tiger to get any attention/ sympathy from the masses ? OK. Any way who is this /u/kumbhakaran ?

http://www.reddit.com/u/kumbhakaran Hi, just wanted to know why its so difficult to make pothole free roads. Shri Tathagata any chance Bhubaneswar will get a high speed internet service that actually is broadband and really works availability and presence wise?

Thanks for your time. Dear Sir, 

I am a fan of your speeches in Parl. Your body language and choice of words are representative of the young and aware Indian generation and this coupled with you grey hair is a lethal combination which can yield thorough results. Although I comment superficially here, I would like to know your views on the nexus between mafia in general and politicians. Do you think the absence of multi party politics having first past the post electoral system will lead to the receding of mafia waves in this country? Do you think having a two party system is feasible in India and will drastically limit the scope of corruption in at least the higher echelons if not at the grassroot level? How and till when we might achieve this? Whats the state of private lobbying in India ? Do you support legislation to curb this cancer ? I appreciate you initiation. Hopefully, we see more politicians coming here and connecting directly with people. This instills a trust in you and BJD. 
Cheers Please request Jay Panda to do an AMA.  Which has more impact on Indian democracy money or religion (caste,) Do you think media in India projecting negative image of India? _/\_Hello  Tathagata Sir _/\_ /u/tathagatasatpathy can U post d link of video 2006 which u talked about
 N.B-For a pudding of the proof, please watch the 2006 video
AND hat-off 2 all ur  well-thought responses  (@_@)
 the first politician(4m ODISHA) to hold an AMA ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. What do you think the main reason for Odisha not producing national level leaders like it used to?. We had Harekrushna Mahtab, Biju Pattnaik who had their place in national politics,but now-a-days we don't find Politicians like them. What problems do you think is easily solvable but still nobody gives a shit?!? aaaaand why cant you try to solve them one by one (with with some help ofc)  Peace !!  Hi sir,
Your party always tells about step motherly behaviour of Central govt. what about your same steps towards other district of your state like kalahandi.
 Hi sir,
I watched your recently uploaded video which contained very meaningful points.
And my point here is like the way central govt is inviting all including nris to invest in India in make in India project.
Same way they or any state govt should invite people to invest in agriculter and they should allow leasing of agricultural land to them.as far as my knowledge Orrisa allow leasing of agricultural land by only some specific categories such as defense personnel or widows. If you can include nri also, then we can invest. Hello! What do you think about ban on India's daughter documentary? 

Edit: what do you think are the greatest challenges for Orissa in the next couple of decades?  Hello sir,

1) What do you like about the present central government?

   2) What do you think about the devolution of powers to the states that is currently happening  (through NITI ayog and various other means)

 3) What do you dislike about the present central government? What is Orissa government doing to fight corruption? Thank you Mr. Satpathy for doing this AMA,nice to see an Odia MP on R/India

Q1.) Will it be wrong to call you a political opportunist given the fact that the two of your Newspapers never play an active role in reporting the involvement of state govt. in the Chit fund scams?


Q2.)If you are the chief whip of BJD in LS,what is the BJD stance on Koshal State formation.(Also give us your personal opinion on the matter)?


Q3.) When will your paper be called ""ODISHA Post"" from the existing ""Orissa post"" :/


The state has changed its name,please to do the needful.
  your views on 5saalkejriwal? Mr. Satpathy, this is for you. Will you fight 100 duck size gau maata ji or 1 gau mata ji size duck? Please answer. This is a very important question given that Gau Mata ji is a very sacred animal and females are disposable. Thanks! 1. On a scale of 1 to 10, if Congis are the most 'secular' at 10, where does BJD stand? 

2. Also, your personal views on secularism as held and practiced by the Congis. Hi Sir.

What's your idea on to tackle the rising number of rapes from your state? Edited.",2015-03-16 02:00:44

",AlphaXor," I've seen this increase in all my subscribed subreddits. Perhaps reddit's popularity is increasing among people more?

 I don't want it to happen, though. Now a days every sub is just turning a bit towards facebook, whatsapp-ish conversations. 
 Reddit announced two days ago it will count logged out users in active users. Same effect across all subreddits.

1. Gaurakshaks

2. Kulcha warriors

3. Journos from Buzzfeed, Scoopwhoop Usually it's some news coverage that causes that kind of jump. Reddit mostly gets negative coverage. I wonder what those damn redditors did now! Was it the eventual shut-down of r/TheDonald? Was it on the news somewhere? Summer vacations? My guess would be the AMAs we've had recently. They have been popularized and advertised on the person's twitter handle and in turn have attracted people to reddit.  Modi sock puppet/s!

Please thank /u/Kunalb11 (Kunal Shah, founder of Freecharge) and /u/wordswithmagic for setting up this AMA.",r_india_mod," Can we please put the pitchforks aside and actually ask straightforward tough questions? This is the need of the hour. The world would be watching this.  Can we please go with some alternatives as a community so it helps drive home the point? It was wrong for FB to call this program 'Internet', its not Internet. It was wrong that they said 'some internet is better than no internet'. It was wrong that it was exclusive for 'signed up' participants only. We got past that already. Its not about NetNeutrality anymore. 


1. Assuming the platform is open to all, Zero rating in principle is not wrong. What we allow to be zero rated is what matters. We can have support forums, dev communities, documentation/help/faqs and such pages zero rated. Not the main marketing site of the product or the core business website. For a SaaS, its easy to make that call, all logged in pages goes off the zero-rating. For a hosted/in-premises technology solution, it means marketing website is off zero-rating. Facebook's main website will never make that cut. Whatsapp will never make that cut. So does wikipedia. Govt services that are informational will be allowed but service based ones will NOT be allowed.

2. Second option for FB to get the next billion users online is to buy raw bandwidth for them so they can waste/use it any which way they please. They can target specific parts of India, like rural areas and be benevolent about it. Lets not try to fool people with 'it is expensive'. People who have dealt with ISPs for bandwidth know exactly what they mean. 


Going with one-track-mind of 'all zero rating is wrong or bad' OR its against NeutralNet will not help us get faster to Internet for all - with the right price attached.  Dear Mr. Daniels, I've highlighted my questions below *in italics*. 

**Question 1:** *How much money has been put into marketing your internet.org platform?* In-app notifications, polls, windows and sponsored FB posts count as marketing. *How much of it was dedicated to the actual product development?* If Facebook stands to make no profit from this venture, why has the company made the said investment in marketing and development? 

**Question 2:** If (big if) the motive was 100% charity, *what other ways were considered as worthy of charity?* Example: Microsoft's former CEO launched the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation to deal with issues in the developing world. Why would Zuck and other stakeholders not just do the same? Do you really think a farmer in Maharashtra can benefit more from joining Facebook groups than having access to high-yielding crop, equipment, and infrastructure? 

**Question 3:** *What are your plans for making sure that the next billion internet users don't fall prey to the same mistakes that the first billion did?* Are there landing pages dedicated to educating them against common internet frauds and time-wasters? What's to say that they won't just end up sending a bunch of frandsheep requests to women and killing each other over online arguments? We both know that's happened many times in the past, and the fact that you're planning to introduce a largely un-initiated audience to this platform greatly increases such risks. *By how much has Facebook beefed up its moderation team to deal with foreseeable cases of severe online harassment?*

**Question 4:** Please take a few minutes to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAQWsTFF0BM) and respond to concerns raised therein. Looking forward to *your side of the story on why VOIP was omitted*. Please feel free to *respond to other critical points* mentioned in that video too.


**Feedback:** Your marketing for internet.org has been atrocious. Calling people who do not subscribe to your world view 'lobbyists' is akin to vilifying everyone who disagrees with you. That's how children argue! The whole over-aggressive, dare I say immature, marketing push has raised more eyebrows than eyeballs. 

I appreciate your attention. Please take the time to do an AMA for more than an hour. This is a complicated and critical conversation, arbitrary limitations on communication will harm both our POVs. After all, having more and better communication is the point of the Internet (.org or otherwise). 

I look forward to an extended, insightful conversation with you and the Reddit India community.

Thanks again! Is there any mechanism by which the mods can restrict this AMA to only those members whose handles are at least a week old? Knowing Facebook and the crap they pull, they are not above brigading the thread. Maybe we should ""accidentally"" call some international net neutrality activists in this AMA? Oh boy. Dayum! Now thats unexpected. Throwing himself (and his PR team) into randians' natural environment.... They've got courage at the very least. :/ May I bring my gandassa please?  This is a huge one. We all need to ask the right questions, and not indulge in shitpostery. Expecting new accounts to pop out of nowhere for the AMA. Won't be surprised if most questions go unanswered Time to post some serious tough questions. If they are able to get this AMA right (even by applying sneaky tactics, like creating fake accounts and posting questions themselves), this would be big news, and they will go all their way to declare how Free Basics was challenged but it stood its way by not opposing Net Neutrality. This must not happen.

Get ready Randians, this is our chance to question the wrong, and prove the people that we can produce more than just dank memes.

Divyashakti aapke sath rahe. A lot of questions have already been posited; and it seems Facebook has some form of prepared response for all these questions.

I think there is a way to clear up the confusion. If I could post my question on this AMA, this is what I would ask - ""*Would Facebook let the users decide what count as Free Basics?*""

They could have gone with 1 month of open free internet for everyone, then the users would have to pick, say, 40 apps that they can access for free from that point on.

This helps connect people too, without letting Facebook gain much from it. That is, if connecting people is their only motto. Is fb letting users to define and customize the websites/platforms included in free basics?
What shuld be included in free basics should be chosen by users not facebook. If fb decides what are free basics then its not ‚Ä™#‚Äéfreebasics‚Ä¨, its ‚Ä™#‚ÄéfreeBusiness‚Ä¨! 
 >Chris has a BSE in Mechanical Engineering from Duke University and an MBA from Duke University - The Fuqua School of Business. 

Chris, heads up. Most comments on Randia are going to sound like the name of your business school. Merry Christmas.  only 1 hour? at least make it 2 pls, it's weekend. Prepare your questions. Holy shit. This is going to be epic. I just hope he goes beyond the usual rehearsed PR response and gives some real answers. Don't downvote me for this, but one of the points 'Free Basics' claims in the newspaper ad is that anybody can join the app and there are over 800 developers who have joined their program already because of this. This takes the tooth out of the claim that Free Basics is hurting new startups from sprouting up. And I am sure, this is the line Chris Daniels is going to use tomorrow to support net neutrality & Free Basics.

What's the truth behind this claim from Facebook? Can someone answer this? 

 > The Fuqua School of Business

Thought you were trolling there for a minute Thanks /u/kunal and /u/wordswithmagic Suggested questions. Excuse overlaps with others.

1. Why not come clean with your business plan re Free Basics? No one begrudges anyone making money. Making fools, is another matter.
2. If your platform really is open to all, then why is it that only Reliance that has signed up so far? What's cooking?
3. Who is @MikeAtFacebook and why should we take an anonymous person claiming to be a VP of some sort on Twitter seriously? Why should we even entertain him? Is he a policy guy?
4. What do you think would have been the fate of Facebook had there been a Free Basics sort of thing going at the time. Elaborate with hypothesis.
5. Lastly, why is the entire Free Basics campaign so patronising? Be careful people! Facebook is bound to pull some shady shit, including vote manipulation. Genuinely curious to know his response here.   Whoaaa, okay I've set a reminder. This is epic!  This is really good, everyone will be able to get a look at both sides of the argument which will help them make an informed decision.  You say there won't be any ads  and that it would be available for free for any developers. I find it extremely hard to believe this would continue forever.
You have every right to  later change your policy, put ads on free basic websites, and pull out your competitors from free basic.
As, simple as that!

Open internet is crucial, specially for a developing economy like India. 
 FUCK YES!! THANK YOU!!! 

This was desperately needed.  [Those looking to understand the Net Neutrality concerns around Free Basics can look at this post and ask questions from it.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3l9y7t/net_neutrality_supporters_are_not_depriving_the/)  Why not collaborate with Google which is a leader in this sector? Hi Chris, please answer any or as many you can.

Do you feel Facebook is misusing it's position by all the advertisements and putting links in people's notifications for supporting their own cause? If an independent company who pays for ads on Facebook wants to do the same, would it allow that? If No - Why doesn't Facebook hold itself to the same standards? If Yes - Really? You'd allow organisations to put notifications in our stream for ad revenue?

Do you think if Facebook was launched in a world with MySpace offering zero rating, would Facebook be as successful as it is today?

What's your opinion on writing government policy which allows zero rating from different providers? Do you see the Internet as we know being segregated into different network groups for the next 1 billion people you want to connect, is this how you envision the future? so is this going to held in /r/india or /r/IAmA  ? Bet he is going to pick and choose questions and give 'pre-approved' answers. Throw in some senti stuff life Digital India, job and education opportunity for next billion and the likes. BC who is downvoting this? Hey Reddit community!  Thanks for having me, and for participating during what for many is a holiday weekend.  This is the first AMA I‚Äôve done, so bear with me a bit.  At Facebook, we have a saying that feedback is a gift, and Free Basics has been on the receiving end of many gifts this year. :)  We‚Äôve made a bunch of changes to the program to do our best to earnestly address the feedback, but we haven't communicated everything we‚Äôve done well so a lot of misconceptions are still out there.  I‚Äôm thankful for the opportunity to be able to answer questions and am happy to keep the dialogue going. This is going to be interesting! I'm pretty skeptic on how this will turn out to be. http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gifv [removed] Guys I know we love logic and mature reasoning in randia, but please be mindful of the fact that logic and reason is not what Facebook is using to promote this. They're simply saying its awesome and it will solve a billion people's problems. So can we also just fucking bully them out of here?

 http://thelogicalindian.com/story-feed/awareness/watch-save-the-internet-once-again-aib-explains-facebooks-free-basics/

So, is it his what FREE BASICS is about? I already knew Something's really fishy on its Name; Now I came to know ! What's the reply you have for this !!! Instead of making websites modify their pages to make them light, submit it and agree to FB's terms of use, why doesn't FB use code to modify any webpage that a user requests to make it light? This will be truly Internet for the poor, right? If connecting and educating people is the main moto of Internet.org, why don't it provides free access to online courseware such as Mit's ocw, edX, coursera?  I wouldn't be participating in this AMA if I was using Free Basics. Just saying. How can the people of India trust internet.org as an open platform? If a facebook competitor wants to use the same services can it? If yes how can we trust you given the fact that Facebook do not allow posting links to tsu.co a social media networking site that pays users for posting content. I have strong gut feeling that this guy is going to be nailed hard, very hard! [removed] Bruce Willis is going to be doing an AMA? Cool!

Besides my work as an actor, TV host & singer (and an ex-Dentist), I am into adventure & a whole lot of traveling.

Thank you for the questions, specially because most of them were not the same, old ones. Love & Luck and may the Almighty bless us all. Ciao! [deleted] Hi Chang! Which has been your favourite reality show so far?

 What was the toughest stunt you did on Khatron Ke Khiladi? 

Assuming that the show has completed shooting by now, who won? :P

PS: Kinda surprised you haven't landed a toothpaste ad yet, lol.

PPS: Any plans for Bigg Boss?  Do you have to be a sadist to be a dentist? [deleted] Hey Man, i really liked your performance in Badmash Company. 

Just wanted to say you did a great job.

If we ever made a Indian Star Trek i would like to see you as Captain Sulu ;) Hi, what is with the title Chang and dentistry? My hometown seems to have a dentist with this name ... Oh wait... Where are you from? Dha.... are you from? Who is your favorite mortal kombat character?  Do you still keep in touch with your fellow Indian Idol contestants? What are they up to these days? Hey Chang! First of all I have been a big fan of your work from Indian Idol days, I had even kept a record of every song you sang in the competition. My favourite was ""Meri saanson main basa hain tera hi ek naam"". The question that i had was, you have a couple of singles out, so when are you planning on a complete album and secondly are there any plans of solo gigs and concerts?  Does Aditya Chopra exist? People say he is a myth. 
Have you traced your roots back in China?  Do you like shocking people with your Hindi?

I am sure lot of people would have been amazed over your command on the hindi language.   Sorry to sound like an annoying aunt but,

Shaadi kab kar rahe ho bhaiya? Do you miss that non celeb life ? ;) [deleted] What do I do for my bad breath ? Do people simply consider you to be someone from NE? Or has anyone asked you if you are from China?


What project/s are you working on now? [deleted] Ass or tits?  Kya aapke toothpaste mein namak hain?  Hi Chang! Thank you for doing this AMA


I have a very simple question : do you like video games? If so what are your favourites?  [deleted] How much scripted is Indian Idol? Can't help but ask - are you bisexual? How was it working with  Chris  Gayle ?  

Also what do you think about casting couch ? Have you been asked to sleep with someone to land a project  for yourself ?

Hope you don't  find my question crude,  that's how I  structure  my  sentence ! 

Thank you and good luck [deleted] What are your favorite books? 

And can we have a look at some of your own cartoons. 

Thanks. [deleted] How many languages do you know ? And you are cool bro ! Hi Chang, 

Despite a performance in Badmash Company that was appreciated, why is that you have not appeared in more films after that? How do you explain the 5 year gap between Badmash Company and Byomkesh Bakshy? 

Have you shied away from playback signing or have music producers not approached you?

Given that you completed your schooling in Dehradun (my hometown) could you tell me one thing that you absolutely love about the place and the one thing that you hate?

And given your love of adventure sports, did you try rifer rafting in Rishikesh?  which gal from bollywood u find hot? [removed] do u watch the oscars? what did u think of neil patrick harris's hosting.. i personally found these oscars one of the most boring.. i luvd the ones hosted by billy crystal.. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Is there a list of banned words for television that you consider should not be on that list? How hard was it to actually get a break in the big bad world of acting post Indian Idol?
Also do you think Indian Idol is more of a popularity contest than a talent contest?
Cheers mate Hi Chang! Thanks for doing this AMA. 
What's one question you'd hoped nobody would ask you?  Hey Chang. Just stopping by to say hello.  Assuming you worked with Neeraj Kabi, how method is he being for Byomkesh Bakshy? :P Thanks for doing this!

What kind of cinema do you aspire to be in?

Would you be open to doing a small indie feature? Or would you rather work with big producers in commercial films? Have you ever traced your lineage to find out when you guys came over from China and what prompted the move? Any luck in finding your first crush? That was a mushy post in your blog but i liked it.


Suggest a decent tooth-pest for daily use. I use sensodyne. Far better AMA than the ones by filmi types Hi Chang, nice  to see you doing an AMA. My sisters used to watch the Indian Idol and they were your fans. They thought it was cute to watch a North-east  guy sing Hindi songs flawlessly. But I felt its unfair for the rest of the Northeast, because only the ones who speak/sing in Hindi have the chance to come to national television. What are your thoughts? Chang bhai u like indo Chinese food or Chinese Chinese... üòÇ üòÇ  [removed] SAAAAAAR THNKU 4 AMA! DO YOU VIST /r/BAKCHODI???????

What do you regret about your college life? Or just life? Are you as patriotic as Zing from Badmaash Company ? Okay I m really enjoying this, the way you are answering everyone's questions ,must appreciate üòä Hi chang, good to see you here., only one question.. how was your life before indian idol and after indian idol.

All the best for your new movie and thank you for the AMA.., Ah, was too late for the AMA :( But will enjoy reading the responses! Nice ! Multi tasking guy :) Hi Chang! Excited to hear you're featuring in the upcoming Byomkesh Bakshy movie. I hope you've a super evil role. 

What do you think? Would you prefer to play villainous characters? TIA. Hiii Chang ! If you have to choose one Singing/dancing/Acting/anchoring/writing/being a dentist ? :P Sup chang chang how do u rate the different reality shows these days from the good old indian idol days.. do these shows really help the careers of the participants / winners? >I am a closet cartoonist

Ooh, tell us more, favourite cartoonist?


And what do you think about the current state of Indian animation?  Let's get to the tough questions.

Faced any off-hand, uneasy comments while growing up? Kids can be cruel, you know. It's a much easy, globalized world now, but things would be different a decade or two ago? [deleted] Do you play any musical instruments? How did you develop interest in music?

EDIT: Also, the Chinese New Year which began last week is being celebrated. Do you celebrate it in India? If so, how? Hey man! Saw KKK for the first time last week, loved it. Then noticed you were in it too. Have fun!

Questions: We often hear about attacks on folks from North-East/Asian features & all sorts of discrimination. What's the worst you've faced? Any discrimination within the industry? What do you have to say about singers turning actors in Bollywood? Is it safe to assume that even though someone doesn't have that acting calibre but only because he/ she is famous, should torture audiences by making movies.
PS: My whole point is towards likes of Himesh. I like your acting! In what movie we will see you next? As a singer or an actor?  Hello Mei, I liked your work in that zombie movie Go Goa Gone.. If you were offered a role as lead actor and you had to choose the lead actress, which INDIAN actress would you choose? What came first? Chicken or egg? Dammit! Missed the AMA! Just wanted to say you're a good singer. which cast do you belong to? (kaun gotra se ho bhayya?)  SAAAAAAR THNKU 4 AMA! DO YOU VIST /r/BAKCHODI ???????
 I don't see my questions being posted here err..!  And I have no more queries , cuz most of them are already answered ;) just wanted to say you are one of the finest guys I've known , hoping I get to meet you someday :* Man, i wish i was chinese indian. Would have helped to have understood my ex-girlfriend when she was angry :-)
 Been your fan since the day I saw you on Indian Idol auditions ! Just knew you'll make it big :D Also Chang! I am a web developer by profession and would like to build you a website, if you don't mind. Don't worry it will be for free :) And you are going quite well on KKK , tbh was not expecting you to be on this Show ;)  A'ite Mr. Chang so this is something that I've been meaning to ask. Being Indian of Chinese descent, what sort of women do you find attractive?  Don't give me the generic answer - because I am Indian and I have some broad tastes ... and I've seen and learned that the culture in which you grow up influences that taste.

Thanks. Once upon a time I respected you.. ",2015-02-24 23:46:36

Talking of machine learning, a month ago I stumbled upon a [post](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47he5m/reading_irctc_captchas_with_95_accuracy_using/) on /r/india where OP was able to read captchas using deep learning.

*From op's github repo:*
> I have used around 10000 samples to acheive 95% accuracy (test set 1000 samples). 

What does 10k sample mean? Did he manually solve all the captchas and recorded them as training data? Or it means something else?

AMA,"Corruption, nepotism, Kashmir: Democracy Indian style? | Conflict Zone-shashi tharoor interview",47,62m13m,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IgQqHlzHH7Q,29,,aap_ka_baap," I wish Indian media and people had guts to ask these tough questions. Someone should have at AMA This is the kind of interview you can take when you actually take time to read through source material and do your own research instead of reading 5 newspaper headlines and speaking for hours on it. Poor guy. Unlike the AMA, he did not have the option of bypassing the tough questions by ignoring them or just saying read my book. Is it just me or has Tharoor been on a media blitz lately? He was removed as Congress spokesperson 2 years ago but I see more of him than all official Congress spokespeople put together. Damn I love this dude, No Indian media will ever have this guts to question the losers and winners like this. 

I fucking loved this. When I asked some of these same questions in the AMA 

>Hi, Shashi a pleasure to have you here and your book an era of darkness was fantastic and very educational about our past.
My questions are

>1. How can you as an educated and qualified person not actually stand up with congress nepotism? Why don't you lead the Congress party?.


>1. Why is it every congress ministers actually want Rahul Gandhi to lead the party? how come someone like you who is more experienced does nothing about the sad condition of congress?


>1. Do you think Congress can ever regain power with the party structure as of now?
Thank you.

His answer was 

>We have a settled leadership in the Congress and the post isn't up for grabs! See https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170318/jsp/nation/story_141318.jsp#.WNdcB_l96Ul Shashi Tharoor's weekly post : Revenge of the British edition",2017-04-01 05:25:32
AMA,How did you guys discover Reddit?,8,6hk01v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6hk01v/how_did_you_guys_discover_reddit/,34,I'm new here and was curious. ,pichlesaathdin," From the ashes of Digg !  [deleted] In 2011, I came upon science subreddit and askscience subreddit while googling for something. There was no quora back then (thankfully). So I liked browsing through the questions and answers on these subreddits. It's the only place I can actually have any sort of real discussion, especially now, anonymity is crucial. > I'm new here

Please go back (atleast from r/india) otherwise you will be submerged in negativity about india and hate your existence. Digg refugee /r/pcmasterrace brought me to Reddit. Then, /r/steam and /r/unixporn From thoughtcatalog.com Erotic fiction.
 When I was working in Sales and Marketting, I was still in training period, had a laptop and nothing to do. Exhausted Digg one day, wondered where else people would go, Reddit came up, came here and noticed it was full of Atheists (back when I was being an angry asshole atheists and used to preach), liked the company and stayed.  By Hollywood celebrities AMA. 


They share thier AMA verification on Twitter, Things changed after that.   2015, that Messi goal against Bayern. was searching porn streaming site redtube on chrome address bar, a faulty click brought me here. :( I saw a roast thread and wanted to join in on the fun thus my username PCMR and Steam trading.  I don't remember. Geez it was so long back. Everyone here inadvertently makes me feel old and world-weary. Oh to be 18 again! My ex introduced me to it. Was searching for movie recommendations. Found r/movies and watched a shit tons of good flicks. 

Thought there might be a sub for India too, came here, became way too negative to talk to any real human, so struck here for now. i stumbled upon the brilliant AMA done by Arnub Goswami where he was torn apart by the fellow redditors (atleast imo)..decided to join then & there!

Diagnosed with Blood clot in my brain and many isochemtric foci that restricts blood and oxygen flow in my brain. Already had tumour. Doctor says that if you take tension anymore (which I am taking, because of my relationships and mental health issues), you will either get a stroke or partial/full memory loss.

Dont know how much time is left, as I have completely lost it - faith, believe system and hope and most importantly my comprehension ability.

I have done pretty good in my life till now and was one of the 1.5 lpm guy! 

Wanted to do few things before I completely dissappear - first online and then offline. Ask me anything. Roast if you want. 

EDIT: Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!

Get well soon ‚ù§Ô∏è [deleted] we're all going where you are, any last words/advice you'd like to give the to us who are slowly dying?  If you come to Delhi, meet me please! I'd love to have a cup of coffee and try to understand how you are dealing with this. My problems are nothing compared to yours.  Rula diya bhai. 

Wishing you the best. üòò

Do update us when you have  conquered all this, which you are definitely going to do! 

Good luck. 
 Hugs. I am so sorry!

What were some best moments in your life?

Also, when was your first diagnosis?  bro , knowing when you will die is a gift which not many will have in their life. So make amends and don't forget to live RIGHT NOW. This reminds me of munnabhai mbbs movie actor jimmy shergil.

Anyway. Stay strong. Have fun. Sorry to break it to you but it's 1.6 lpm, not 1.5 lpm. hi, i hope you have people around you to help you deal with all the bad stuff,

I keep joking around about how i wanna kill myself, posts like these open up my eyes to how surreal death would actually be.

dont really have a question specifically, but if something, what has been the best advise someone ever gave u?

you have my best wishes Hang in there tight buddy! All the best.

* Do you have a bucket list?

* When was your disease diagnosed?

* What happened to your relationship? (Sorry if it is too personal; you can skip it)

* How did you diagnose it? Were there any symptoms?

* Apart from the risk of stroke and mental issues (which I suppose is because of the grim situation), does the disease debilitate your functioning?

I understand this is a tough situation, but boy you are a fighter. This very AMA is a testimony to that.. Not a lot of people can do it. This community will be here for you when you need it. 420 Blazeit.

Anyways, what do you want to do for the rest of the days. Also any regrets? Bhai, this is the time to touch as many lives as possible.


You have already said you have been called dick & arrogant, try to live peacefully & inspire folks around you with a positive outlook.


Even to have one *(additional)* person look up to you makes a lot of change. With nothing to fear, you can reach your true potential. Start distributing good memories around man. I'm so happy to read that you have no regrets. In the current juncture of my life, I'd probably die with a ton. This is inspiring me to do shit and not waste time.
&nbsp;

I hope you can beat it but if you can't then I hope it is a painless & peaceful exit. Keep fighting! When are you planning to see Avengers: Infinity war?

Stay strong bro What suggestion/advise would u give to a 17 year old? *One day we will die, snoopy*.

*True,but on all the other days we will not*.

https://in.pinterest.com/pin/208221182750317976/ What's plan of action now? Can I/we help you get any of bucket list wish fulfilled? Best of luck mate. 

What were the symptoms and how did it get diagnosed?  Ok. Knew a guy who had a brain tumor. The doc. gave him max one month to live. Not wanting to disappoint his parents, he got married against advise of all friends. It's been 10 years since. He has two kids, and still working as of this day....   


The brain not receiving oxygen is a serious issue. But I would say don't lose hope or give up easily. Ultimately, you are the best judge, however, having a positive attitude will give you the best shot at life.

Good luck. What's the main cause for this disease??

What medical test should be taken to diagnose this? Kuch Ni hoyega tujhe Don't have any questions. But just want to wish you the best. Sending you a virtual hug bro!

Get well soon :) I found this post 

This is my cousin Gareth. He lost his leg to cancer 3 years ago and now has 15 lung tumours and is terminally ill at age 26. Last week he completed the London Marathon.  [The link is at the bottom of the post]

I‚Äôm not suggesting you to go for marathons but at this time you could do things you wouldn‚Äôt dream of.

As it was mentioned in Dark Knight Rises, ‚ÄúHow can you move faster than possible, fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit: the fear of death.‚Äù

This is your race against time. This is the right moment to challenge life.

One last thing. You run, you fly, you fall, you crash but you dare not stop up till the end of your time.

 Sigh....first of all if what you have mentioned is all true, then it's really sad that an asset like you might be leaving us in the near future. My deepest condolences. 

This world is weird in the sense that those who want to die cannot die, those who deserve to die, don't die..but those who really want to live and are willing to contribute to this world regardless of whether for themselves, for their families, their kin, or for humanity as a whole, often end up getting the short end of the stick. From what you have told us about yourself, you also seem to be such a guy. If there is any supernatural entity overseeing this world, then I curse such a megalomaniacal but irresponsible and impotent being for playing such games with us. It really pisses me off how almost no theist ever curses and blames this guy. Thankfully, I gave up on such an entity long time ago, and am happy being an atheist now. When there is no sense of security of being protected by such an almighty being, there is no disappointment at times of peril and grief too. When there is no hope, how can there be any hopelessness and fear at the moment of crisis?? How can there be any sense of betrayal from such an indifferent entity at such times?? There will only be peace of mind knowing that atleast you didn't waste your precious time in life by praying to such an apathetic and egotistical entity. Since you have already given up on him, I hope that your last moments shall also not be filled with such a sense of disappointment and betrayal. 

Though, if possible, try your best to overcome it and get well. But if not, please live your remaining moments to their fullest. Have no regrets. If you are still a virgin (hope not)...get some snu-snu.üòé If there is some cuisine you might want to try, go for it. Don't worry about the lynchers even if it's beef. You can always visit North East or mallu-nation. If there is any place you would like to visit, don't stop yourself. If there is a drink/weed you would like to drink/smoke, don't hold yourself back. Please consult the doctor before you try to pull any stunt though. But, basically live the rest of your life for yourself. BE SELFISH. 

Sorry for the long post, but that's pretty much what I wanted to say. I just got a bit emotional reading your story. 
Also looking at your report, it seems like you were diagnosed with cholesterol which might be the cause and precursor (just pseudo-sciencing here). That serves as a warning for me to get into shape too...Have been gaining some 'tond' recently. üò∞ Blame these: üçùüçïüçîüçü. Kudos to your spirit.Hats off to your attitude.At the outset,I wish to extend strength and a bearhug from my side.I hope and I sincerely do,that you find peace with your existence and with all the going arounds of this world,things that we all have little control over and yet besiege our mental spaces because hell who doesn't want a better world.

Stumbling upon this AMA,trying to grasp what you might be feeling now, this makes me look upon my life like Carl Sagan would have looked upon the pale blue dot of Earth from space,small,petty,filled of meaningless trivial rants,and yet to understand how I could make a teeny difference in the right direction for the good of people around me and myself.

You my brother(I hope I don't come across as pretentious,because well we don't know each other)
are an inspiration.Your mere act of admittance of your current situation and the fact that you would want to give back to the society,to kids,(I read your other comments),is testament to your awesomeness.

I wish upon you these lines from Dinkar,

Just kidding!

Hey man, all the best for what the future holds for you. Hope this phase passes soon and you come back stronger than you ever were. Don't count yourself out yet. 

As they say, It ain't over till it's over! You got this! I really like your spirit and hope you live the most before cycle of birth and death takes you along.

\- What are top things you would do if born again? First of all, my condolences. What do you plan to do now? Have you already quit your job? I'm sorry to hear that man. I really hope your recover soon! How did your family reacted to it? And is 26 too old to pursue my masters in Europe(My dream)? Get well soon brother!  I thought long and hard about what to write, but I'm at a loss for words. So here - *hugs*. Sending you lots of good vibes telepathically :) what advice would you give to someone who has failed, or feels like he's failed in every aspect of life Sales Job Hai kya,?  Have you seen Randy Pausch's Last lecture video?  Try giving something to others. It can make you feel better.
Teach others what you know. Especially where it can make a difference in their lives.  bro.. girlfriend hai toh break up karo. go travel. everyone you know will bum you out. dont spend all your money, just incase you survive.

.. and most importantly batao kya chahiye.. russian, israeli ya desi? randia will fund this.

better yet.. go to thailand or something. get aids or die trying Here I am slaving away, losing body and mind. There you, positive attitude against all odds. If you are inNumbai, PM. As someone who has lost brothers and sisters at a young age, please make sure your family is mentally prepared.  Serious: people say meditation helps to calm the mind down. Have you tried it? If yes, did it have an impact? Really want to know? Much love from Bengaluru‚ô•Ô∏è. You're a fighter even if you shed tears, remember that. Spend each moment on your terms. See you on the other side, though I hope you don't cross over for a long, long time. Overall, be Brilliant and beautiful in whatever you do.
Question(s):
 Any tips for an 18 year old inexperienced twat like myself who's about to go to college? 

What were your fondest moments and who do you want to spend most of your time with now that you have this sense of finite time left?  Big hugs ‚ô•Ô∏è things will be okay brother, please PM if you're in Bangalore or Bombay, would love to meet you over a cup of coffee üôÇ Too late to the ama but OP, I think I have an interesting idea. Go to malls, meet random people and have interesting conversations with them. You can have a placard/tshirt describing your condition and your desire to have interesting conversation.  Once you are comfortable with this, start a youtube channel so that everyone can cherish your memories.

May be good fun. Since you were a 1.5 lpm guy, i guess you must have some savings. What are you gonna do with it?

Also, how hopeful are you in our country's future? Do meditation. Try yoga. Shirshasana/sarvangasana improves blood flow to brain. But consult doctor if you can do it. Daru piyega? i.e. if you're in Bangalore I am currently a neurology resident. You can PM me if you have any questions regarding the diagnosis.  Ek sawaal hai \- how was your lifestyle \- good or bad. If bad, where do you think you screwed up? It can be a good wake up call for a lot of 1.5 lpm guys here. And here I was like - 
""Ki aisa mere saath kyun hota hai"".?

Kudos man to you and your courage. :)

I lost a friend not a close one to cancer and I regret meeting him for the last time, due to some misunderstandings between me and him. I have flashbacks of it.

Just one thing I want to say, Go out and meet every person you know and wish to see for the one last time. These experiences can change people life's for Good.

Enjoy your life and Go out there and Kill it.
Aur haan, Tension na le. You will be fine.

Any regrets you have in your life?  [deleted] hey, good to see you holding up.
now that you are here in this point of your life, what do you think about yourself, as a human being? do you think what we are doing on our little earth, matters in this vast, unlimited, expanding universe? 

As a single individual human, merely being a worthless cog of the Human Engine, in which others are spearheading us into our evolution, and still we don't know anything about the cause of our existence, or where we are headed, or does it matter at all, I many times find myself lost in these thoughts. What do you think actually matters? Driving on the Highway the society built for us, or making our own path?

What do you think about the faiths and religions you did/did not followed?  Is it incurable? To accept your own end is as brave as it can get. 

Who knows, maybe you find something else on the other side. 

Hope you have the best time you can in what remains!  Hey man, no questions, just wanted to say all the best! You will come out of this. And if things go South, please don't delete your account. [deleted] Please stay and fight till the end friend.  Hopefully you will be back after a miracle.  Bro, Try yoga, Baba Ramadev ne bola hai Yoga se sab accha hoga.
And If you want chill pill? PING ME! Don't really have anything to ask but good luck with your recovery and keep in mind, miracles can and do happen!  Virtual hug to you. Keep fighting till end. Hey OP , you may not like it but could you make  a series of videos how you perceive life-death-future you or anything you wanna share . Upload it on youtube May i ask when you realized there was a problem and you need a diagnosis? Can we take precautions with checkups in some way? Aur God bless you bhai. I don't want to annoy you with my questions. I will gift you this [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7lyYoi2dpE), This is the song which I listen when I am most stressed and drained out.

Theek ho jao bhai, zindagi lambi hai! My cousin died because of blood cancer. He went on and said sorry to all those people who he hurt or said something in past. They all forgive him for the things he has done. He died very peacefully with no regrets about his life.  How many real life friends do you have? How are they helping out these days have you considered donating your organs? you look like the prime candidate for donation, all organs intact, no infectious diseases, and in prime of youth How are you man? Hope you got some good news. Where's your medical proof that you are diagnosed with all that?  You seem really in hurry, even I had to type this message at 1000 w/m. To avoid the chance to roast him the last time. 

.

.

.

.

A guy who will be deep roasted in few days is asking for a roast. 


PS: How was that?? I need feedback if you there....... [deleted] Since you're aware of your situation, are you doing drugs? I guess it would be easier for you to get into it.  Aw shucks man, thats really sad to hear. How does complete detachment from everything around you feel?
 Sorry to hear about you- I hope you can fulfill all your dreams !!
I would suggest make some YouTube videos to teach further so the knowledge never dies !! 
 What are your favourite movies, books, shows, songs etc? We'd love to know! 

Also, hopefully they help you cope with it better. Reading your comments, it feels like you have very few regrets (I may be wrong) and that's something not a lot of us can achieve. Good on you for living the way you wanted to! 

Hopefully your time here has been fun and continues to be. Cheers!

* Just read that you're going back to your hometown to spread some education! There is no greater joy than giving back, and you're one of the very few who will achieve it! So that's really great on you man! Did you had a good time? Hang in there bud and if possible stay strong for your loved ones.I had a friend who knew his time was coming soon and it was heart wrenching.


 Pilani dude?  of all the things i have seen on this subreddit even this site,this make me sad. all i hope is u get well soon.i am not a religious person but reading this i said help him god. How old are you? Are you married? Fuck tension. Let's grab a beer.  Stay Strong Bro ! Totally at loss of words. Feel better today!! Kinda feel happy for you in a wierd way. Knowing I'm stuck in never ending cylce of 8-5 college plus wards plus never ending studies plus bleak prospect of pg entrance plus childhood issues. 

Sorry man. I don't mean bad on you. Have a good afterlife.  Hey sorry for your condition. I want to know how you got the job at UN? Through contacts or are you from a really good university? How old are you? How is your family taking it? Dear /u/aadhaatom
It's not over until it's over. You need to believe that this can pass and you need to fight. And fight harder than you ever have. Tell death to fuck off. If you have to go down, go down fighting! have you thought about saving your sperm? Isn't Megavac an option? I am so sorry bruh, _hugs_ üò≠ Adopt a puppy,go to an orphanage and spend time with the kids,go to an old age home and spend time with grannies.Do sewa at a nearby gurudwara/church/mosque/temple (including cleaning shoes if required)...And finally,get laid. I'm so sory, OP. I hope you get well soon, hopefully :). How are your parents dealing with this? What is your biggest regret? Not losing hope. Not having it either (right now) Take care Bhai. My best wishes with you and your family. This is terrible. Hugs and hang in there!

Make a blog or vlog of you teaching kids if you can, you‚Äôll leave behind some crazy amazing motivation for a lot of folks. And keep posting here, I‚Äôd be happy to see you pop in every month :) if your doctors are absolutely certain there is no way out, do a complete fast from food for 30-40 days with just minimal water intake. There are magical powers in fasting. I can guarantee you will be cured.  Just a suggestion for increasing you lifespan a few more decades.......get a death mask done. Search it up if you don‚Äôt know......im 16 and have decided to do it whenever the time comes. Hopefully you dont need it this time though. And best of luck. Dont want to offend.

But facing the reality

Do you have the urge to travel your heart out? So sad. How old are you? Are getting cremated or buried? Did you choose your coffin or urn? What was that like?  Kudos for dealing with it in this way. I hope you get to live longer. Desire to live and trust in medical can go a long way. And regardless, I hope you enjoy the rest of your life. :) 

Would you like to recommend any movies, games or apps that you absolutely love ? 
Or perhaps you could also share your music playlist ? 

Thanks. You are a strong man.  You still have to be optimistic bro. Just believe in yourself at least ? First of all, kudos on answering so many questions. 
Secondly, best of luck on your endeavors. You are someone who must have a different perspective on a lot of things now. What's something very few of us know about life that you have learnt because of your condition? I  mean you are dying and I might die a little bit late but I'm dying a little bit everyday anyway. Do you see the importance of doing what you want to do over doing what other people want you to do? Would you advise me to take the leap of faith and chose the career that I love or should I stick to the safer option that would get me good salary and  wheatish woman from shaadi.com? You're braver than I can ever aspire to be. Hang in there. Big hugs xx.  I'm trying to imagine myself in your position. I would say, you should think of the things you felt you always missed, and try to make your peace with those things.

If you think you'll miss your family, spend time with them. 

If you feel you want an apple design award, see the inner motivation/desire. Why do you want that award? Recognition? It represents Professional Success for you? 

Let me tell you, the best design is what comes naturally to you. No white guy/Jony Ive/Tim Cook living a 1000 miles away, who doesn't know your life/where you come from, can judge your work. Just draw/paint/design for yourself, remove the need for external validation, because that validation is just a show. Apple isn't the world authority on design. Be satisfied and happy with your own designs :)

What topic do you want to shoot the film on? Do you want to reach out to people? This AMA was pretty successful in that aspect :) Put up some videos on youtube, don't sweat it :)

I would definitely spend time with family, teach kids etc. I think your life would be more successful than mine will ever be, if you manage to make your peace with things :)

 How much time is left? Are you going to die soon? Or memory loss? What changes are you experiencing? 
Where exactly are you now?
 Did you abstain from meat? 


or eat it in very few quantities?  Was the 9 to 5 worth it? Have u made a will? How about a living will in the eventuality that u end up a vegetable, god forbid. Would u opt for euthanasia? 

Have u quit ur job? Did u vent out at anyone who u ever felt frustrated with?  Since nobody has asked, what's on your bucket list?
 Try brahmi . It's a cerebral vasodilator. And smoke weed for the tension :)
 I eat meat. Quite often nowadays.  Yes of course!  I will pray for you. Stay happy my friend. Thank you for all your questions, comments and wishes. What a great community this is. I felt so relaxed talking to each one of you. Read most of them (except some long ones) and tried answering them. I wish you all well and hope you and I both do good. See you somewhere soon. Sayonara!  Dost, Ek help kar do hum sab ki. Tell us what all of us are collectively doing wrong and what actually matters. Youtube pe video daal do. Aap shayad aane wale time main bahut logo ko sahi raasta dikha sakte ho. I read most of your replies and I have an impression that you believe that your work defines who you are. Help the world brother. Show us the path. Aur agar Bangalore main ho to milo jaldi se. Sorry brother to hear that, any to do list or any path/goal ? Hey man, hope everything thing will be fine. 
Just make the most of whatever time you have left with you. Travel alone for sometime to your dream destination, spend time with people you love and tell them you love them. Live a happy life 
Hugs A warm hug to you bro!  I'm sure you'll get well soon. Kindly PM. Will love to meet you over a cup of coffee :D  Hope you are doing fine. There is no activity on your account Dude, don't panic. Try to get better first, talk to your family about this. Don't lose hope as yet. You can survive this if you take precautions and are in good care.  Visit a good doctor and start treatment. I'd suggest meanwhile join a vipassana mediation course nearby.

Also is that a bad time to visit? Petrol ka kitna bhaav chal raha hai udhar? Thank you for doing this. I hope to visit Nepal someday.  Few years back I read you guys adopted a new constitution. How has that worked out? Is there any good Nepali porn out there? I visited Lantang region before the Earthquake . It was the most remarkable trips of my life.

Some of the villages then didn't have electricity back then in 2015 but I hope Nepal electrifies all it's villages soon India and Nepal has 2 main meta dynamic. 

One is that of the Indian State/Govt, which basically is hated, disliked, not trusted, etc by Nepalis(state and the people). 

But at people to people level things are more pleasant. This is why the relationship works because the people links are too strong.  


Nepal needs development. And personally I am of the view that settings artificial barriers to it is futile. Development at all costs. Period. Like on a war footing. No compromises. Just get it done at all costs. Deal with the consequences later.   

Even if it means you live less(should not matter given they and poor places anyway has short lives, at least when they are developed they will live those short lives better). Being predominantly Hindu country,Are there many supertisions or are your people over them? Bcoz here mostly Hindu Hindi belt seems to be superstitious as fuck(poverty there could be the reason too). Nepal-India relationship was never the same after the murder of the royal family. Looks like a foreign hand. How do Chinese tourists get around? Is the language barrier significant for them? Could you share the stats by country on Nepali tourism? Is the [royal massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nepalese_royal_massacre) still talked about? Any thoughts about the theory that Dipendra didnt do it or that India was involved? How is the massacre regarded in terms of its repercussions? Has it recovered from the earthquake? Ah ! I am quite icky-picky about a communist state. I know definitions are different in East but...

A) What is the current status of communist party of Nepal ? 

B) What is general outlook towards economy ? Are they considering opening up to FDI ? 

C) Are there any discussions about climate change and it's effects ? 

D) Are people aware about debt trap ? 

E) Are Nepali aunties/uncles as nosey and irritating as Indian aunties/uncles ?  I was kind of thinking that India-Nepal relations would get better in case the Modi government falls next year. But was just reading some thread on /r/Nepal and looks like you guys hate Congress even more because they are accused of supporting the Nepali maoists. 

Is there any redemption you see in ties? Lord Buddha was born in India and Garhwal was a part of Nepal before being a part of India.


How many times you guy watch ""Gharwali Bahar waali"" in a month ?








This is what I used to say to my Nepali roommate in college  great job dude to show up and even deal with the entitled a-holes  too.

&#x200B;

Indians, as someone said, are proudest of the least to be proud of.  Nepal should definitely lead the way as it always has done. Kathmandu was global long before india even knew what flower power was. The current reality is that China has made the great leap forward and has 10,000$ per capita income, an aging population and a huge savings hoard...and anyone who partners with them will definitely benefit. For all the talk, China has always been a civilization content with itself, and not expansionist. 

&#x200B;

My dream is that Nepal shows the way and helps be the bridge between India and China ...and thus creates a global powerhouse with 1/2 the worlds population, huge shared landmass and sweet synergy in Manufacturing and Services coupled. We literally wouldnt even need the West. India provides employment opportunities to many Nepalis. they are eligible even for the highest government services in India, and are freely eligible for all sorts of private employment. do you think your government is ignoring vital Indian interests in moving so close to China despite this?

What if India revokes this special treatment to Nepali citizens suddenly? it has helped people of your country so much in the past. its almost like Indians going to US for a better life, but while US needs workforce in those fields (STEM), in case of india its just a goodwill gesture.

Basically, what's an ordinary Nepali's opinion, would you like a friendly India with special all weather friendship, or a more transactional 'what's in it for me' kind of diplomacy where you lean towards anybody who's giving you a better deal in that moment? also consider the cultural similarities between you and India, vs the other side of himalayas (and tibet).  What is the point of switching to democracy when it obviously doesn‚Äôt work? Look at the US President! A total nut job! Monarchy means one is trained from the beginning of life to take responsibility and sit in the big chair.

Kudos to the mods for keeping the discussion civil, but in the end it just felt as if she was not up to the task, which in turn made users who asked the question feel as if they were taken for a ride.",an8hu," That was so shit. Can we first set expectations with people before doing these things? Like Imran Khan knows what the reddit audience is like. It's not like Twitter where you give a few curt replies and it's done.  Rana ji writes much words many sentences only in her books. For the online peasants 4 - 5 words max per reply will do. I enjoyed Priyanka Chopra's AMA more than I did that one. That AMA was total shit . I am in future neither gng to read her book nor her stories and i am not a right-winger It has to be one of the worst AMA i have ever seen. Single line single word answers looks like the person was forced to do this.  [deleted] Not understanding the reddit crowd (which loves long, detailed answers) is one thing. She even insulted us when I asked why is she writing one-liners! I think she is a little entitled. I think it wasn't bad. 

Even not answering certain questions, giving one liners or cryptic answers or evading the subject tells a lot about the person.  Look on the bright side. The person more or less gave away too much of info about their attitude.

 Smaller unknown crowd, may or may not buy book, no mention in media, talk to peasant s? Meh, I will better talk on camera on national TV. Many views. Much talks. Wow attention. So much money.

Secondly, avoiding uncomfortable questions with lame excuses. 

Now you know which column or TV show to skip.
 I blame twitter. People have forgotten to be elaborate and expressive. A race to conciseness which carried over to the AMA maybe? Ok quick read through the answers, this was Rampart level shit
 pls ask sir Looked like she was lacking in motivation because she wasn't getting paid to this.. From what the mods said, the fail is understandable. I was more pissed about the chutyap low effort ignorant comments like she recognises only Baghdadis'court, questions about her religiosity getting up voted. Discussion was not civil at all with some of the indirect questions. I may not agree with her work but no one deserves this treatment, at least didn't expect it on reddit. [deleted] There was an AMA? Damn man I generally look forward to subreddit specific ones. Well, at least she answered two-dozen odd (may be more) questions. It was AMAGF  (ask me anything about Gujarat files)

 I think the problem is that her entire area of claimed expertise is one thing and that one thing is detailed in the book she's out to promote.

 >a great AMA session and would be reported by the content stealers like poopshoop tomorrow on their websites, 

Do you even know what you are talking about. When a notable person says something on a social media site should the media just ignore it because it's "" content stealing""?

Should no news site ever report something said on Modi's twitter because that means stealing content from twitter?

This OC circlejerking really has gotten to people's heads. It's ridiculous when you consider a lot of ""Original Content"" on /r/India is lifted from facebook or twitter without giving credit.

AMA,"AMA Announcement: Rahul Yadav, co-founde[r] and CEO at Housing.com - Tuesday, 19th May 6PM IST",236,365xqh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/365xqh/ama_announcement_rahul_yadav_cofounder_and_ceo_at/,180,"**AMA LIVE HERE**: https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/

---

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.

**Verification**: http://i.imgur.com/T9uPJow.jpg
",AwkwardDev," I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! 

I'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. 


Also, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:

1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. 

2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?

3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?

4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?

5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?

6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif I have a very genuine question for Rahul, hope it doesn't get moderated.

Rahul, what do you smoke ? how much do you pay for it ? and how many times a day do you smoke it ? You got Rahul- oh. Never mind. Awesome, 
this will gonna be awesome, but it will attract a bunch of rubbish media.  Monk who sold his ferrai? Or the monk whose driver refused to drive unless he gave away his ferrari We are so lucky to have few out of those precious ~3L working hours he is left with! After doing all these stunts.. Do you sleep well? How much do you sleep? **Do you even sleep?** Because I have seen you post on facebook early in the morning at 4 A.M. or 5 A.M.... Your situation is like *""Raaton ki neend gai, din ka chain gya.. kya hota hai ye klook[up] klook[up] klook[up]..."" ???* He is in his chappals btw in that verification pic. :D

edit- No offence meant. Calling Deepinder. This one would b an epic AMA ! I think he'll do a U-turn in the last minute, skip the AMA and flip the bird to all of us. Lets do bets...how long before MSN/ Clickbait sites pick this story up & which one will be first...winner get a puppy people get oil and frying pans ready ;). let me leave now to buy a pack of popcorn :) Going to be a nightmare for the Grammar Nazis.

How did you feel when you realised for the first time that you've only ~3L hours left?  Bhai, IST bole to stretchable time hai kya? 6 to baj gaye! Has the AMA started? How do we use this reddit AMA firstly? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?** 

Please be as candid as possible.

 Its happening here guys - http://ss.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/ When does this start??
 Tell him to get some lube.  This is going to be fun! *Marks the calendar* *Rubs hands in glee* What about Rahul Baba?  There is a lot of confusion in the ecosystem right now, everyone is there with his/her own opinion on the recent events. It is now time we actually hear one side of the story in first person. I am having my college exams and you know engineers study at last moment still I am gonna attend it. I signed up just for this one AMA. No matter what he says, there's going to be roughly equal number of people who admire him, and those that make fun of him.

Sorta, kinda like AK or NaMo. This is one to watch out for, for sure! He's the Balotelli of startups. ‚ô™ Yeh to hona hi tha ‚ô™ But...but...are we worthy? Remind me to here at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot I hope he stops behaving like his other namesake in politics. It is a great opportunity to get to know his part of the story. I just joined in reddit to participate in this AMA :)  Who would you say has inspired you the most and why? Do you consider yourself successful? Is there more to housing.com than VC money? GUYS BRING YOUR ALTS WITH THE MOST FUCKED UP USERNAMES I hope this session dosent turn into a ROast  [removed] Let the games begin! Just got a reddit handle for this  This is going to be fun....waiting :D 30 minutes to go. Let's see what unfolds!
 Let's say I were to cruise up to your local bar with my IIT D t-shirt. I sit down at the bar and order an overpriced old monk. I grab the remote from behind the bar and change the channel to Roadies. I strut over to the jukebox and play some Linkin Park and ask your old lady for a dance.

How do you feel about Digital India ? What you would be doing. If you leave Housing.com Where is the ama going on ?! what will be your next kick? r u a salman khan fan?? Did you just kept thinking to get an idea or u just got it one night in dreams?
How do you find people with same level of enthusiasm as you for an idea? Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who has done commendable jobs in their fields. IF your resignation was not a publicity stunt what was the reaction of Mr. Shailenra and other board members over your letter? Hey Rahul,
How you are able to take such big decision in very short time? can we start?
 give some tips on your digital marketing campaigns according to me they are huge i mean you are everywhere on the internet (housing.com) Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who had done commendable jobs in their fields.   Are you planning to open housing office in Seattle?
Just curious because my current home is having water pipe burst...:-) when will you enter into the sf and give a kick to us startups?
lets play a story telling video on the home page instead of static html pages
bull shit?? What does Rahul have to say about the comments comparing him to Arvind Kejriwal? Nice. Say what you want about his behavior, he has been more successful than 99% of the people on r/india. Looking forward to the AMA. This looks like 100% PR stunt... Rahul, are you Rakhi Sawant? don't rediquette tag the AMA  The best thing about this is that he is going to literally Answer Your Anything... Interesting...

Hello,

Last year I took a Term policy from ICICI Prudential. I took this policy with the intention of ""Insurance"" rather than ""Investment"".

So as per this policy: 1) I will be paying Rs. 14000~ for 30 years. The Sum Assured is Rs. 325000.

2) At the end of Premium Paying term, company will pay Sum Assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

3) If I die within Premium paying term (30 yrs), company will pay ""twice"" the Sum assured, plus revisionary and terminal bonuses if any.

4) If I die after the Premium paying term or if I turn 100, company will pay the Sum assured (without revisionary and bonuses).

Questions:

1) The Sum assured is less than the total premium I ll pay. Is it normal for a Term policy?

2) If I die during Premium paying term, are the returns sufficient in comparison to the amount I pay?

3) Points 4 and 2 seems to be confusing. Are they going to pay me twice?

Please help clarify, as this is my first policy. :)

AskIndia,"Ambassador of India takes back my newly issued OCI card, suggests a pay for and fill out new application. Please advise.",12,bdfid1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bdfid1/ambassador_of_india_takes_back_my_newly_issued/,27,"Hello /AskIndia!  First time poster, long time lurker here.

&#x200B;

Brief background: My wife is Indian and I am Canadian, and we have been so excited to finally visit her family in India this summer. I applied for the OCI 11 months ago per her request to make it happen. The application never went smooth, but that was never expected, as goes this story for most OCI applicants. We properly submitted all our documents, and each month like clockwork, we receive additional requests from the Indian Embassy for ""extra"" documents that weren't requisites on the OCI application checklist. We happily oblige to all requests with exceptional punctuality, no questions, just documents. 11 months go by since we submitted everything, and finally we get notified that my OCI card was ready for pick up at the Indian Embassy. Just come with your passport so we can take fingerprints and you can be on your way to India!

We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds) . When we finally get to the Embassy, we sit down with our consulur,  who strangely didn't greet or make eye contact for the first few minutes of our meeting.  She hands me my OCI Card, its receipt, and asks my wife to sign document a declaring that she agrees to forfeit my OCI card to the Government of India in case of my death or divorce.

However, things got strange when the consular went on her computer and said that the electronic fingerprint software wouldn't open up specifically for my OCI file.  She stands up, picks up my passport and brand new OCI card, leaves her office to meet with the Embassy's  Ambassador and only returns with my Canadian passport, not my OCI. She said the Ambassador is in a bad mood and suggests that I  fill out and pay for new application.

Excuse me, what? I've never seen or met the ambassador. What is happening?

She explains that my OCI file number could not be retrieved in the system because the application was submitted in 2018, and because it's currently 2019, there were ""crossed wires"", thus resulting in their inability to take my fingerprints and give me my OCI.  My wife and I make the suggestion of taking physical ink fingerprints at the local police station and  bringing them back to the Embassy, so they can have a hard copy. She said that the ink fingerprint option is not possible and reiterates that the best solution, as per the advice of the ambassador who wasn't in a good mood, would be to fill out and pay for a new application. Back to square one, 11 months down the drain. We are confused, just drove 7 hours at her request to pick up this card only to tell us to our face that we can't have it and we need to start again.  We politely try to press her for more information, and the best option she has for us  was for her to email a request to her OCI contacts in India to try to resolve this by issuing a new file number and a new card, but not to be optimistic.

What is going on here? Any advice would be much appreciated.

I  should also add that I am Canadian living in Europe, a qualified  professional in ""interaction design"", educated, and don't have a criminal record.",FrustratedOCIHopeful," Honestly, she and her supervisor behaved *exactly* how most of our government officers behave with residents of India. Inside India, they typically do such things to extract a bribe. I can't say for sure if she has the same expectation.

&#x200B;

One option you have - if OCI matters so much to you - is to tweet your problem directly to India's Foreign Minister, Sushma Swaraj. She is supposed to be proactive about such things, especially when it comes to matters like these where they like to project a good (but false) image of our government, and tweeting to her in front of millions of followers basically forces her hand into helping you. Also, pulling strings this way by bringing in somebody influential to get what you want is very much the Indian way, and since you wish to become a quasi-citizen of India, you might as well start learning our bad habits.

&#x200B;

I, personally, am not a big fan of kowtowing to influential people or to our government officials. I wouldn't have gone for an OCI to begin with, and if I absolutely had to for some reason, I'd try it once and drop the idea once it turned out to be too hard. You have already sunk enough costs for a card that is of little benefit. I suggest dropping the idea entirely. As a Canadian, I don't think you'll have any trouble getting multiple entry tourist visa for frequent visits. This lady sounds full of shit. Why would an ambassador concern himself/herself with OCI affairs? 

Even if she isn‚Äôt lying, it‚Äôs worth emailing the consulate/embassy politely explaining the situation and cc-ing the ambassador if you can find their email. If there are multiple consular missions in the country, try emailing them as well. Tweet a summary with some details to Sushma Swaraj , she has helped ppl in similar situations Hi, I'm sorry to hear that you had to go through this. You'd think these people would adapt to the local work culture/ethic but it seems they are pushing their work culture and ethic on the locals, which shouldn't be the case.

&#x200B;

Please tweet your issue to the minister of external affairs:  [https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref\_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor](https://twitter.com/SushmaSwaraj?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor) 

&#x200B;

make sure it's public and that her twitter is tagged in your post. She is very well known to bring visa officers in line when they refuse to carry out their duty. Do keep us posted about things you did for this issue. If it is just for a visit, apply for a regular visa. You can always visit India as a tourist. As regards your OCI card application, tweet or send a message to the External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj with your experience. probably you are lying in fine details, or it is shitpost or karma whoring.

as an official, one can certainly say that - an ambassador is too busy to deal with  ""We drive 7 hours to the Embassy, getting pumped up to an audiobook set in India (yes, we're nerds)"" r/iamverysmart individuals.  
moreover, if any of the official encounters technical problems - it is impossible for them to say ""cannot be done because of bad mood"".

I'm British and would like to learn more about Indian history, but most of the most prominent scholarship on the subject in the UK has come from non-Indian Brits, and often comes with particular biases (particularly regarding British colonialism). I'd therefore appreciate it if anyone can point me towards good written histories of the country by Indian scholars.

AskIndia,What is 'Gotra'?,42,a2nsgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a2nsgt/what_is_gotra/,33,"Hey, there's a term quite popular right now in news debate, of 'Gotra' and I don't know what it means, so can anyone tell me about it?
(Note: Actually I want to use 'AskIndia' flair also but couldn't do that as Reddit restricts flair to 1)",ab370a1d," In¬†Hindu culture, the term¬†gotra¬†(Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡•ã‡§§‡•ç‡§∞) is commonly considered to be equivalent to¬†clan. It broadly refers to people who are descendants in an unbroken male line from a common male ancestor or¬†patriline. Generally the gotra forms an¬†exogamous¬†unit, with the marriage within the same gotra being prohibited by custom, being regarded as¬†incest.[1]¬†The name of the gotra can be used as a surname, but it is different from a surname and is strictly maintained because of its importance in marriages among Hindus, especially among the higher castes.¬†PƒÅ·πáinidefines¬†gotra¬†for grammatical purposes as¬†apatyam pautraprabhrti gotram¬†(IV. 1. 162), which means ""the word¬†gotra¬†denotes the progeny (of a sage) beginning with the son's son."" When a person says ""I am Vipparla-gotra"", he means that he traces his descent from the ancient sage Vipparla by unbroken male descent.

According to the¬†Brihadaranyaka¬†Upanisad2.2.6,¬†Gautama and BharadvƒÅja, Vi≈õvƒÅmitra and Jamadagni, Vashishtha and Ka≈õhyapa and Shandilya¬†are seven sages (also known as¬†saptarishi); the progeny of these seven sages are declared to be gotras. This enumeration of seven primary gotras seems to have been known to PƒÅ·πáini. The offspring (apatya) of these seven are gotras and others than these are called¬†gotr√¢vayava.[2]

One who follows the system defined by three sages defines himself as¬†tri-a-rishaye. Similarly, for five sages, it is¬†pancha-rishaye, and for seven sages, it is¬†sapta-rishaye.

There exists another theory about gotra: sons and disciples of a sage would have the same gotra; it is believed that they possess similar thought and philosophy. People of the same gotra can be found across different castes. Each Gotra comprises¬†pravaras.

 Basically representing the ancestor.
e.g. Agrawals have 18 gotra based on the 18 son of Maharaj Agrasen.  Gotra basically tells you from which ancient sage your bloodline is descended from.

Gotra are very important to Brahmins. Other Hindu castes care lesser about it. Also you can use Gotra to tell from where a particular brahmin is from. That's how it was known Rahul Gandhi's gotra was from Kashmir.

Source: A Brahmin. There is agricultural metaphor behind gotra 'logic':

&#x200B;

*Indian farmers often draw  comparisons between agricultural and human reproductive  processes, as when they compare a fertile soil with a womb,  the seed with semen, sowing with copulation, harvesting with  the severance of birth and the happiness it brings, and  the barren lands with the post-partum period or, at times, with female widowhood. This reproductive view of agriculture is not unique to India, but is found elsewhere in human societies.*

[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The\_Seed\_and\_the\_Soil](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1933302.The_Seed_and_the_Soil)

>Men give the seed which encapsulates the potential child. A woman's body, like soil, provides the nurturant context for the foetus. This was graphically stated by another Turkish villager: If you plant wheat, you get wheat. If you plant barley, you get barley. It is the seed which determines the kind of plant which will grow, while the field nourishes the plant but does not determine the kind. The man gives the seed, and the woman is like the field (Meeker 1970: 157). The nurture that women provide-blood in the womb and milk at the breast-can be supplied by any woman. This nourishment swells the being of the seed-child and while it affects the growth and development of the child, it does not affect its essential identity; that comes from the father. Women's nurturing capacity is valued, but it must also be remarked that the substance they provide ultimately derives from men since men are thought to engender both males and females.

>The substance women contribute pertains only to this world-it is perishable and does not carry the eternal identity of a person. The child originates with the father, from his seed. This is the basis for what I call a 'monogenetic' theory of procreation.

AskIndia,"What happened to the ""spiritual country"" that India used to be?",28,ai7392,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ai7392/what_happened_to_the_spiritual_country_that_india/,17,"So I do not know whether to put this in Ask India (because it is a question) or Reddiquette (because it is a discussion in and of itself). But I wanted to discuss this with someone, *anyone.*  

So ours is (used to be?) a spiritual country. Off the top of my head, I can recall at least 4 major religions that began here: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism. Who knows, there are probably more that I don't know about. And at the core of these religions (irrespective of how the religions' followers have interpreted things) these religions are supposed to be about GOOD. About being nice, kind, compassionate, loving, forgiving.  

The prevalent view in India about the west and people from western countries is that those guys are ""materialistic"" and we are somehow more ""spiritualistic"". I couldn't disagree more.  

Rather, I see the values and virtues of simple kindness, love, nicety, acceptance, love and certain other so-called ""spiritual"" virtues on the rise far more amongst the western world than in India. It is not like people are rising up in arms against ideas such as racism, sexism and homophobia for no reason in the west. Indians, meanwhile, are still dealing with the Supreme Court ruling legaylising gay relationships. While kids in the western worlds are growing up being more accepting of kids from a different economical background than theirs, or someone who has gay/lesbian parents, or someone who has anxiety issues or what-have-you; we in India are drumming up noise about what ""ancient India"" achieved in terms of scientific advances and how ""our Indian culture"" is above all and everyone else is somehow beneath us.  

Now don't get me wrong here - I am NOT trying to say that ""the west is perfect and that all Indians are all dicks"" or anything like that. Indians (outside of the major metroes) are still some of the most kind and helpful people that I've met - so long as you don't discuss things that will piss them off e.g. religion, caste system etc. And yes, the west has a LONG way to go before they become all accepting, just look at the MAGA crowd and the whole feminist cult. But that having been said, I really wonder why we as a country are not waking up to the fact that we are becoming ""evil"" day by day (ironically, while attempting to tell the world how ""good and virtuous our *ancient civilization* is"") while the one's we have *vilified* as the ""ignorant western people"" are slowly leaving us behind; much like the tortoise in the tortoise/hare story.  

Just a little something for everyone to think about on a regular Monday morning. Cheers.  

**EDIT:** And it is surprising that while so many WhatsApp forwards talk about how India had the best *""Vimanas""* (spacecrafts) or the best *""Brahmastras""* (weapons equivalent to a nuke); nobody, like LITERALLY NOT ONE SINGLE WHATSAPP ""FORWARD"" talks about how *humility, kindness, forgiveness, acceptance etc.* were the (supposed) virtues of people from that time period. Perhaps promoting such virtues in our current world is not seen as ""cool"" enough by the people who forward these forwards? I dunno. But it fails me how having a *personal flying ship* is somehow more important than basic love and kindness towards one another.",fenocs," It all starts with the relationships we have with our families, the education we get and the amount of time we join our brethren in discussions/reflections on life.  
Having a healthy appreciation for the achievements of our ancestors and using them as an inspiration to work towards a progressive future would be a great way forward. India is a ritualistic country, has always been. Spiritual places/people do exist in himalayas, varanasi, arunachal ashrams etc. and they still in full glory. Your position is too simplistic. It‚Äôs the kind of logic one would see on a meme. 

First of all, this idea of claiming certain traits is not unique to India. America claims ‚Äòfreedom‚Äô for example. Some Japanese have tried to argue how the Japanese outlook on beauty is different than that of the rest of the world. The Germans claim ‚Äòindustriousness,‚Äô the Chinese ‚Äòstability and order‚Äô and so on. These are ideals, but not defensible under a court of law. 

Nobody should be tallying up points to prove or disprove any of these because it is a meaningless exercise, meant only to attack how a country sees itself ‚Äî and it will win you no favours, however right you may be. 

Next, you don‚Äôt factor in how much of this ‚Äòspirituality‚Äô is a direct counter to western colonialism and market imperialism. Even a casual look at Indian history does not convince me that ‚Äòspiritualism‚Äô is a major feature of most kingdoms or empires in the subcontinent. Not that the Bhakti movement, the Sufi movement, the Virasaivites etc. did not exist, but that they were quite often not the defining feature of Indian politics or active life. 

Where you see the mystical India emerge is in British writing, and later Indian writers, politicians and reformers trying to separate India from Western civilization. As late as 1810, India accounted for nearly 25% of international trade and quite a lot of global gdp. I doubt spiritualism was at play here. 

Moreover, this talk of spiritualism is also often used to silence the active role Indians have played in history. It‚Äôs far easier to think of a quiet, backward and peaceful nation of mystics slipping behind the west because they focused on ‚Äòspirituality‚Äô and not on technology. The far more complicated truth is conveniently left out. 

And finally, is it all that ‚Äòlove and kindness‚Äô  in the west that has had them bomb every country between Saudi Arabia and India? Is it love that has allowed the US president to call Africa a continent of shithole countries and ban immigration from ‚Äòmuslim countries‚Äô? 

Even regarding social liberalization, is it love that made the US push abstinence only sex education and preach against the use of condoms in Africa during the HIV crisis? Is it kindness to continuously threaten to restrict access to abortion for women? Ban Burkinis? Call migrants fleeing terror and war ‚Äòswarms‚Äô as if they were pests? In the words of the Black Eyed Peas: ‚ÄúWhere is the love?‚Äù

Your view is either myopic or bigoted, in that either you receive restricted and biased information or you are far more forgiving of ‚Äòwestern‚Äô countries than India. The truth, of course, is that India is also becoming more socially liberal. Only time will tell, once Indians are as wealthy as Americans what the social landscape in India will look like. Here‚Äôs the thing: In my lifetime I‚Äôve only seen it get better. 

I don‚Äôt even defend this characterization of India as a ‚Äòspiritual‚Äô place. India is anything but spiritual for most Indians who actually live there. It‚Äôs the foreign ‚ÄòEat-Pray-Love‚Äô crowd, doing hot yoga and sipping Yerba mate tea who see India as this mystical place. Sort of like the Beatles. And India in response capitalized on it. To me, it is a foreign import. But if that‚Äôs what India wants for the future, I think they can go for it. 

Again, I don‚Äôt think for one minute India is a better place for the average trans person than the US today, but you imply that by virtue of spiritualism and kindness and love, we should be, and that‚Äôs just wrong.  Religion existed as means to control societies. It kept people within tribal groups. Gave them a code of behaviour and roles to play. It made sure the oppressed never questioned why they were opppressed and the weak to be happy with their lot with hope for future rewards. Plus it helped explain phenomenon they did not understand. Now we understand almost everything and can come up with scientific and logical explanation for most phenomenon. We follow rule of law and secular philosophy rather than religion to dictate our morals. We don't need religion really. Now it's only a crutch for the weak minded and people who are in a bad position in life.  Spiritualism was once indeed an aspect of Indian culture. That generation is long gone. Today, spiritualism in the Indian context is more of a feelgood consolation prize (hey we might be losers, but we are ""spiritual""). In reality, we have become way more worldly and materialistic than some Western societies. Bc khaane ko paise nahi, rehne ko room nahi, peene ko daaru nahi, aur babu rao ko sukoon nahi. Aur tum sprituality ki baatan karte. Religious and materialistic are not opposites of each other like you make it sound. Religious texts and behavior is the singlemost biggest reason for people being homophobic,sexist etc. these texts outline what sexuality is right and what is not,what a girl or a boy is supposed to do and what not. If only people can think and have empathy on their own without needing random holy texts,we wouldn't have so many problems in the first place  Communal politics.  Its an irrelevant comparison as you are not taking country-specific factors into account:

1) The West is economically developed vs India and has at least 30 years of a headstart. Any society will automatically try to cure itself of its evils once your basic amenities and infra are taken care of.

2) No other country is as diverse as India - religion, language, food, culture, race, caste. You name it and India has it. Now I have nothing against diversity, but from a social perspective, it does put us at a disadvantage as politicians can continue to target specific vote banks without focusing on economic development. Consequently, when there is no economic progress, social progress is hard to achieve.

3) You might underplay the importance of gay sex legalization, but there has been a real change in mindset, at least in the urban areas. This is tangible social progress and it was unimaginable 20-30 years back. Even when you look at the USA, not every state has legalized gay marriage.

Btw, what is your definition of evil? The average middle class in India have always been like this. The spiritual India that you're talking about, existed in  ""Ramayan"" and ""Mahabharata"". I didn‚Äôt find what was the specific question though LOL, spiritual country my foot! Let me quote myself that I've written elsewhere, albeit bit edited. This was specific to issue of legalization of weed but, overall I think I got the point across.

AskIndia,European looking for opinions from Indians regarding how to make a difficult relationship work,28,968di3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/968di3/european_looking_for_opinions_from_indians/,67,"Namaste Redditors, (also posted to AskIndia but I am in need right now)

I am from Central Europe and in a 1.5year relationship with an Indian woman. Without going into too much detail, we are pretty sure that we fit very well together, but the problem is that she is from a very traditional family (arranged in-caste marriage) who she loves and is loved by.

Understandably, she does not want to 

1. Hurt her family's standings
2. Cause her family grief and pain
3. Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.

I can secure her a safe, free life (be it in India or in Europe) with a near-guarantee of a loving, supportive husband. 

I want to make this happen, but knowing that she would never hurt her family like that, meaning she will ultimately marry another guy, I feel conflicted as to whether this relationship should go on.

I would appreciate any opinions on this. Especially from people who have been in that situation or who know what other ways are there for us to be together without hurting the family and its standings.

Thank you very much for reading and commenting. ",PsychoPass1," Hate to break this to you buddy, but you are the third wheel.

The sooner you get out, the better it is for you.

I would suggest a show down as soon as it is possible. Ask her to talk to her parents and choose between you and her family asap. My guess is that she will choose the family. From what I gather her parents haven't even started pressuring her and she is already starting to break. Indian parents have a long list of arsenal at their disposal. Get your parents to meet her parents and fix the union.  [deleted] I've thought of doing this but haven't had to - Ask her to pretend to show interest in other women in front of her parents. And then eventually bring you into the picture. 

If there is anything Indian parents are more afraid of than inter caste marriage, it's homosexuality! üòÅ Take the initiative. The kind of description you've given, I think this approach might work. Your girl clearly has no spine to stand up for you. Get her dad on your side, how, use money and respect. Address him as sir, be very respectable, go as far as promising to convert to whatever religion/cast he wants. Tell him you'll give her a good life. That could work, or at least will soften him.

Now man to man, I wouldn't advice going for a girl who can't stand up to her family, you may somehow marry her today, but her family will be a cause for grief all your life, because there will always be something with them.

Don't know all the details though, good luck! Welcome to casteism,OP. Try watching Bride and Prejudice for help. Same situation, except the girl told them that this is how she will love and that she will always love/respect/etc them, but she will choose the person she marries (me). Everyone also told me to 'forget it' and 'prepare for the worst', but she came through. All you can do is support her and make her aware of the tactics/ploys which her family will employ to psychologically browbeat her into submission. And by no means should you consider yourself any less. It'll be difficult at first but afterwards, you'll laugh about it.  In my experience, the only way these types of relationships work is if the Indian involved is strong enough to stand up for him/herself to their parents, ALONE.  In other words, ultimately the fight is between her and the parents - not you.  Even if you offer her all the support in the world, if she cannot in her heart fully commit to you and is inching closer to her parents' influence, then I don't think it is worth marrying her.  Think about it.  What if down the line, when you are long married, her parents keep interfering in her life and won't stop? And if you have kids, they will insist on raising them this/that way and may continue to haggle her over it. They will emotionally blackmail (Indian parents are unfortunately masters at this) until they get their way.  Point is, if she has problems drawing clear boundaries now, it will make your life HELLISH in the future.  No matter how strong a husband you think you are, a marriage is ultimately a two person deal and 'saving' her will only lead to heartbreak and psychologically scarred children.  Sorry to put it bluntly like that but I feel it's the truth.

The responsible thing, I think, is to really have her come clean on how strongly she wants to work things out with you, versus obey her parents.  Have an honest sit-down with her and push her into really answering objectively. If she is wishy-washy, tell her that you will have to leave her- because it shows that she is unwilling to face and meet the real consequences of her actions.  I know that relationships are rarely black and white in terms of how you feel for each other, and are often very gray - but real world consequences ARE black and white, with very real specific physical/mental/emotional results - that is why you have to get firm with her.  SHE is the one who will have to fight - and if keeping the family status-quo is more important to her, she won't have the strength to do so. 

No matter what happens, DON'T let your feelings for her propel you to 'save' her and be her champion.  It's almost sure to end badly for you, her, and everybody.  It may be painful to break up, but that pain will be nothing compared to what you will save yourself if you don't.  

So good luck, and remember- let it be up to her. There‚Äôs a reason you hardly ever see Indian women with non India guys.  
You just run smack into it. 

She‚Äôs just like the majority.

(Most) Indian women simply don‚Äôt do foreign guys be it tradition, family, culture.....

Unlike any other culture marriage in India  is an utterly unique, special, watershed event. I‚Äôm sure you know this thou. Are you sure that she's with you because she loves you or is she with you because, in a way, you're 'exotic' for her? Well I would suggest that you meet up with her family in some other pretext and get a sense about them. In many cases I have seen, Indian girls are way too scared to talk to their parents like mature adults and perceive things more severely. I would also suggest that you should ask her to identify a person close to her parents whom she can trust. That person can put in a good word to make things easier.
On a lighter note: Watch Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, it's a similar situation (to some extent). Understandably, she does not want to

Hurt her family's standings
Cause her family grief and pain
Basically get shunned and exiled from her family.... 


The ball is in her court. She needs to think independently and get this sorted. 

On the other hand,  I hope she loves you truly and not just because you're from a European country or for financial independence. You need to make this very clear. 

Please think twice before you proceed. 
Some Indian women are too emotional and tend to be escapist. 

Her parents would constantly belittle her for going  against them and this might  take a toll on your relationship in the near future. I'm also a  minor victim of this. 

 grandkids have fixed some of the relationships. your mileage may vary. Well I am late here. But all the best OP!

I hope your woman has the courage to stand up for you. 

In the end the family wants a genuine guy with a decent income and stable life ( I am sorry but that's how they work in India) and if they give you the chance to talk and you can convince them, there are possibilities. 

This would be a harsh test of her character and your patience, but I hope you guys come through. Please keep us updated  Move on and break up with her . Help info : where s her family located  ? What is her caste ? If she not willing to STAND UP TO HER PARENTS!!! LET IT GO

AskIndia,Clueless American: Food Etiquette with our Indian Neighbors,53,bemcxg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bemcxg/clueless_american_food_etiquette_with_our_indian/,24,"I'd initially posted this to r/AskIndia and got some advice, but I was also directed to post this here too. My main goal is to avoid any inadvertent rudeness on our family's part. 

 

So we have some neighbors from India (we're in the U.S.) and they have a daughter around the same age as ours (preschool). The two girls have become good friends and play together several times a week. Whenever their daughter comes over to our house, she brings a snack with her, and politely declines anything we offer her while she's here (they're Catholic, and do not have any dietary restrictions from what they've told us) which is usually fruit or crackers, never junk food. Whenever our daughter goes over to their house, she ALWAYS comes back with food of some sort. Sometimes its a small snack, sometimes its something more elaborate. They've also brought us food on a couple occasions too (always delicious). We've had them over for a meal a few times, and they eat sparingly.

&#x200B;

My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. But I want to make sure we're not somehow being rude. Growing up, if I went over to a friend's house, their parents would give us snacks/drinks. Similarly, if friends came over to my house, my parents would offer food/drinks. But should we be sending our daughter over to their house with her own snack? When we cook something special, should we bring some to them? I just want to make sure we're being good/considerate friends.",JaJH," You can directly ask them if it would be ok to offer their kid some food and if it is what things need to be considered, like any allergies, etc.

Also, their not eating much might be their food preferences(might not like weatern food) or maybe they're shy ( Many Indians are shy when they are eating at someone who's not close) I don't have an answer to your question, but I just wanted to say thanks for making the effort to learn and understand a new/different culture. If everyone was like you, the world would be an amazing place! I've been living in the US for nearly two years now (Indian national), and I can see some similarities with my upbringing.

First, their kid bringing snacks to eat at your house is kind of weird, but not really.
Indians have this whole thing where they tend to refuse something that is offered to them once or twice, even if they want it. But it's way more simpler with Americans. If you're eating a bag of chips and offer some to an American, they'll take it if they want it, or refuse. But if you offer some to an Indian, they might refuse the first time. This means that they are waiting on you to offer it once again, so they know that you really meant it when you offered it, and you're not just offering it for the sake of doing so.
This explains how they send food over with your daughter, but eat sparingly when they're over for dinner at your house. They probably refuse seconds because of this.

Its definitely not something you're doing wrong. It's just the way we are wired. If they didn't like you or were offended they would interact with you or your family that much.

The next time they refuse food, just plop some on their plate regardless and see if they'll eat it or leave it on the plate (this is how Indian aunties torture you lol) >My impression is that they just don't enjoy Western food, which is completely fine. 

Quite likely. What snacks does their daughter come with? If it's a Western snack, then you can certainly bring it up with her parents. In India, it's considered quite rude to go to somebody's house and not eat at least a little of what they are offering you.

Having said that, you don't want to be pushy. The main thing is both your kids are building the friendship so just go with the flow.

The real issue is that they don't like Western food so even if you cook something special and bring it to them, they may be forced to accept it out of politeness but it would likely go to waste. They'll be more than happy to feed your child when she is over there so don't over-think it. They are probably happy their daughter has found somebody close-by she can be friends with. So, just relax and enjoy the friendship. I dont think that they dont enjoy western food.I think this is partially a cultural thing, part of being a good guest is to make sure your host isnt going to be troubled. Indians have this in common with Iranian people, it is considered polite to refuse the first couple of times, unless the host insists. If their daughter not eating the snacks you offer is troubling you, politely insist, they might usually take it after a couple of tries, or leave it out and let them help themselves. 

Eating sparingly is also considered good manners, rather than eating till fit to burst. Exchanging food and snacks is a common way of showing friendship. So taking food over to their house would be a nice gesture. I dont think you need to send your daughter with her own snack. I honestly don't know about why the neighbors daughter is bringing her own snacks and is not eating what you all offer. It is probably the things that others have said, that she prefers Indian snacks.

Regarding the neighbors eating sparingly when they're over at your place for dinner I have an alternate theory which might be true. often Indians eat dinner very late at night, maybe even after 10 p.m. if that is the case with your neighbors then if you offered them dinner at 7 p.m. they might just not be that hungry, and hence eating sparingly. You're overthinking this way too much. Cheeseburger next time plz It's a part of our culture (at least Bengali culture) to bring food when we visit any neighbour or relatives. I've seen it from a very young age and I'm used to with it. I think you are over thinking it. They won't mind.

  


I also have family in US (Houston, Texas) and they have told me that American food sucks so maybe that's why she doesn't like that. It's alright :) that moment of realisation that American food sucks really bad!",2019-04-19 04:13:12

I have never voted till now due to similar circumstances. 

Back when UPA I and II were in power, the obvious choice was BJP or its allies. But now that their true colours and agenda are out, my conscience wouldn't allow me to vote for them.

AAP is out of the question as Kejriwal has demonstrated his greed and hunger for power again and again. He keeps allying himself with all the wrong parties in order to protest against whichever the incumbent is.

I will never vote for INC until they change their top leadership and overhaul the party structure as a pro-development secular party with centrist policies.

Who do I vote for?

BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them. 

Are there any good candidate/parties that are not affiliated to the Sangh Parivar/RSS/VHP?

If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state. 

I wish to see India as an educated, liberal and inclusive country that keeps religion out of its government.


**EDIT:** *Should I flair it under Politics or AskIndia?*",concernedindianguy," Founders of Indian democracy did not create a model where you vote for a party or the PM candidate. Just because you like Modi/Raga/Kejriwal does not mean all candidates of the respective parties are good. What most people don't realize is by voting for a 'PM' candidate, they are actually destroying the spirit of democracy. 

For general elections, research local candidates all of parties. Find a candidate who is honest, hardworking and has a history of doing good work and raising issues that matter to you. If you blindly vote for a party because you support their PM candidate then you may get a local MP who is useless and will not contribute anything in development on your region. 

EDIT: Typo > BJP will win in 2019 no matter what. I just don't want my vote to go to them.





NOTA. Look at your MP candidates and vote for the best one irrespective of their party... [deleted] Simply don't vote. The current version of NOTA is a joke on us. So not voting is the better option. Doesn't matter    

#EVM ==> Every Vote for Modi NOTA. I know it is useless, but I have to register my dissatisfaction with the quality of options given to us. Ask after 2 years.  I'm voting for AAP because I want to see what that insane man does. India has survived 60 years of Congress and nearly 3 years of BJP. I'm sure it'll survive a Kejriwal.  > If this trend of right wing Nationalism continues, we'll turn into a Right Wing authoritarian Fascist pseudo-state.

u lost me here.  [deleted] For me, it's gonna be anything but BJP. They have become too arrogant. Do you have any regional parties prevalent in your state? I'm from Hyderabad so I guess I could vote for TRS. They've been doing great work.  Vote for Priyanka Gandhi if she is next PM candidate  I'll probably try AAP now I suppose. Tried INC -> Didn't work. Tried BJP -> They've done some good IMO, but as of now, they are super distracted. So the only party that is even trying is AAP, so I suppose that gets my vote.

Honestly the demographic dividend problem (and resource) is a very big one that can make or break the country's future. And nothing but a fully-focused push can achieve anything. Even then, it might be far too little , too late, but I'm always a hopeful man, so I'll still believe. But time is running very very low for things to be in place (as is India, we are already way past deadlines), but lets see what happens. [deleted] BJP , there simply isn't an alternative ! If you need to ask others who you should vote for, I think you are an uninformed voter and should refrain from voting. A better idea would be to make yourself informed and decide for yourself.

I personally will probably vote for INC, unless a better alternative comes up, but you should make your decision yourself.",2017-04-06 01:54:57
AskIndia,"r/india, what's your Entitled/Idiotic Indian Abroad story?",334,cjv92h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cjv92h/rindia_whats_your_entitledidiotic_indian_abroad/,392,"Most of us must have watched that viral video of the Indian family stealing stuff from a hotel in Bali. Not saying that this behaviour is exclusive to us, but I'm sure a lot of us have witnessed this first hand. What's the worst incident you recall first hand of Indian folks behaving badly abroad?

For me:

1. Our flight was awaiting departure at the Malaysia airport. Suddenly, the weather turned bad and it started raining very heavily on the runway. The pilot announced that there would be a delay of few minutes due to weather conditions. Hardly 2 mins later, this Indian lady - a honeymooner from her looks, gets up and starts yelling at the crew. ""Explain to me what is the issue"", ""what is the estimated time for fixing the issue"", ""Oh so our time has no value after paying so much money?""... BC pakka some IT mid level manager who kept yelling to ""fix issue asap"" at the poor crew. Her husband was of course supportive and joined her in the shouting match. Eventually, it took some co-passengers to calm them down.
2. Possibly the worst people to board a plane could be found on the Bangkok route. Groups and groups of crass middle aged men making lewd comments about the air hostess, or hell, even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny. Even more tharkis asking their co-passengers where to get the best ""maal"".
3. Seen many people throwing trash on the streets (habit from India), being obnoxious to other tourists (mocking them for their physical appearance or ethnicity) and sharing like 1 beer amongst 5 people. While in Pattaya, a HUGE number of establishments (strip clubs, bars and lounges) turn away Indians for these reasons. If they see brown guys approaching, they just tell them ""Sorry, members only"".
4. Reasonably well behaved in hard-assed Singapore. I wonder why...
5. On a flight to Dubai, after the flight took off, a Muslim guy got up and started looking for something in the overhead compartment. So, this moron sitting next to me calls the air hostess and asks her to check what he is doing. ""Bomb nikla toh?"" he said that so loudly that even the Muslim man heard it. Turns out, the Muslim man was just taking out his lunch box. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"", he said while getting back to his seat.",rushils," Any flight going to Thailand is usually trash. Always filled with a group of obnoxious uncles who are so giddy about getting laid that they literally can't stop chirping throughout the flight.

Thailand in general tends to attract some absolute shit tier tourists, regardless of nationality. Oh man. So there was a huge line in Bangkok for boarding pass and everybody was standing still in line while some impatient people of my own country literally unhinged the rope from the pole and got in between.
Everybody fucking followed and got in the middle. The airline crew had to come and maintain decorum. The white guys just stood surprised. I was at the Chicago airport and some elderly women sitting across me at the gate, loudly, in my native language (Telugu), started gossiping to each other about what I wearing (sneakers, jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie). After like a minute or two I told them in Telugu I can understand everything they're saying and to mind their own business and they had the audacity to tell me I don't know how to speak to elders. Changing a baby's diapers on an empty seat WHILE PEOPLE AROUND ARE HAVING THEIR MEALS. 

I've never seen a flight attendant so upset; he had to almost drag the mother to the washroom (where they have baby-tending facilities) >even singing antakshari at night because they thought it'd be funny.

What the actual fuck. Cutting into queueus, gets on my nerves every time ! > ""Bomb nikla toh?""

Security check-ins are just a casual formality for him. Not Abroad but an asshole Indian family from abroad spotted at Delhi airport. I landed from Leh and was super hungry and late because my previous flight landed late. This family argues on the counter while taking boarding pass asking for a free upgrade. Upon asking why sir, Have you bought an upgrade ? Their reply was ""actually we're from US"". Whenever I go to india from Tokyo to Delhi via Thailand, the difference between the two legs of the journey is huge... Had gone to Switzerland and there were a lot of Indians. On Jungfraujoch, there was this middle aged guy who shouted in the loudest voice I‚Äôve heard: ‚ÄúIS THIS VEG!?!?‚Äù Everyone looked at him but he didn‚Äôt give a shit. Since he was evidently not going to apologize, I went and did the good deed. Someone from the same group was trying to score a mini bottle of Red Label for free even though you had to pay for it. Their argument was that ‚Äúwe have bought so much food, we should get one for free.‚Äù Eventually the cashier got hella pissed and refused to serve them. 

When I read the the rules that the Swiss hotel had put up, I wasn‚Äôt surprised. That‚Äôs not racism people, a lot of travelers are just rude and entitled. This didn't happen to me, but when my SO was flying to Dubai, there was a middle-aged Indian man who was sitting next to her (with one seat gap between them). He straight up grabbed food from my SO's meal saying don't mind no? He also proceeded to fight for more free alcohol after having like some four pegs before.

I was glad there was a seat between him and my SO and she got out safely but man, you tend to meet some really creepy people on flights.

I have also seen Indian families just walk to plug points in airports and proceed to remove other peoples charging paraphernalia just like that, without asking them and then put their own chargers there. After that, they proceed to beg saying please please and then hog that port until the end of time. Why is it that as indians we hate to see other indians when we visit some place touristy? Is it just me ? When I go some place and see indians there I get upset and think oh no these fuckers are here too !! On my flight back from Heathrow to dubai(final destination India), there was an Indian lady with her son, sitting on my window seat which I had booked as soon as check ins opened. She said with such entitlement to me that you can sit on the aisle seat. Didn't find it decent to say anything or maybe I didn't have the right words at the moment, I settled into the aisle seat. After sulking within for 10 minutes, I asked her to move back to her seat.

I might have given the seat had she asked politely but the attitude!!! The antakshari point made me cringe inside out Literally, everytime I get on a flight. To or from the us to india, there are obnoxious Indians, who either block the boarding gates even for disabled passengers. While getting off the plane, they dont care if their luggage is banging others and will run over others in front of them. The worst part is when the steward / stewardess bring drinks. They try to hog drinks like its holi. 1. The 'First One Out' game that we guys play as soon as the flight has landed. We all are used to seeing this but it's fun to see the faces of foreigners new to this experience.

2. Drinking beyond limits just because it's free - another thing that we frequently see on International flights. 

3. Not seen most Indians doing this but have still seen a considerable amount breaking queue everywhere possible, be it coffeshops, grocery stores, airport lines, toilets. Was fun to see our fellow countrymen breaking queues for Tube Tickets and the Englishmen just shaking their heads or muttering to themselves since they are too polite for their own good. 

4. Have seen a full blown fight between an Indian group of 7 to 8 and a Pakistani group of nearly the same size in a UK pub. It happened because a guy from one of these groups was acting fresh with a lady from the other; don't know if these individuals were Non Residents though, police had to be involved. Ohhhhhh God there are so many .

 bunch of gujju aunties being reprimanded by an security officer at airport toilet . Apparently they had deviced an unique strategy , where woman who is using the washroom would lock the door with one leg so the next one can go inside after her without paying for each individual use . Like this 8 or more women used to go at same time . They had absolutely no shame on their face , nor do their husband . On the contrary , they seemed proud of the unique idea . I even heard one of them saying proudly ""madam , expert Che""

Why do such people  even travel Europe , Australia etc for vacation . Got on a flight from Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad in which I was on the window seat next to an elderly gentlemen on my right. He had come before me and once I sat down he started to complain about how unethical and disgraceful it was that the flight had put him next to a girl, lol. He moaned and moaned until a younger gentlemen sat in front between two men asked him to swap seats. So this is in Sydney. Everyone takes the train to get back to the suburbs in the evening. And it's also well known that the train network is complicated, and a signal issue, or a medical emergency at one station can create delays and a backlog for hours. (Trains run every 2-3 min during peak hours). 

During one such day a signal issue at a station meant that every train going in that direction was delayed for an average of 15 min. Every signal was turning green slower than it would. The train I was in was later on and was also majorly affected. We were delayed by 30 min, and the train was stopping every now and then waiting for the signals. 

The train driver kept announcing frequently that he's waiting for the signal and that's why we aren't moving. Also said Sorry for the inconvenience even though it's not his fault. When the train stood for long at a platform he'd open up the doors and say passengers are welcome to stretch out on the platform, and he'd inform when he's ready to leave.

During one such stoppages and Indian uncle got pissed. We were in the first compartment. He got down at the platform and started shouting at the driver for the delay. He said things like ""You may drive a train, I have more important things to do"", and ""its because of people like you, trains are always late"". The driver was patient and just repeated that he cannot move until he gets his signal. 

Uncle was not happy. Kept screaming, and said ""do you think I'm a fool"". An Australian gentleman told him he was a fool and asked him to shut up and defended the driver. 

&#x200B;

And then Uncle says ""My wife will scold me for coming late"". The entire compartment laughed out loud and Uncle lost his voice after that. Saale sab dusron ko dosh de rahe hain, apne girebaan mein koi nahin jhaank raha hai!

T: Everyone is blaming others, no one is introspecting to identify the mistakes they made themselves.

I will tell a story where I was the idiot/entitled one. First time I went to US, I went to my hotel to check-in. The woman at the reception was talking to another customer. There was a slight pause in their conversation and instinctively I thought this is my opening and barged in. She immediately stopped me with, ""Sorry sir, I am talking to this gentleman here"". That was the first time I realized that you are supposed to wait for your turn patiently. On the other hand, when I came back to India, it became evident that this won't always work in India because if you politely and patiently wait for your turn in India, your turn will never come. My worst experience was in Finland last year. I was there on an exchange program with my school and my friends and I were in a club. I was getting a drink at the bar and this Indian dude came up to me and started asking me shit like, ""Yaar firangi ladki ke saath baat karunga to chodegi kya?"". I told him not be a dick. Apparently he was there for a business thing and he worked for Nokia. He started asking me to set him up with some of my female friends (none of them are Indian so he thought this was his chance). I squarely told him to fuck off and not to embarrass himself. Then I stepped out for a bit to take a call while my friends were inside. While I was outside a female friend of mine came outside to tell me that apparently some Indian dude was bugging them and he claimed to be my friend. I ran back in to tell him to fuck off but by then the bouncers had already gotten to him. They asked me if I knew him and I told them everything that happened. They asked me to leave anyway but my friends kinda stood up for me. It was embarrassing as fuck so I left anyway... 

The fucked up part was that, that guy wasn't even drunk. He was just a fucking choot. Was on an Air India flight heading to europe. There was a family with a kid whose diaper was soiled and  was stinking badly (obviously). The kid was still sitting on the seat! But that‚Äôs not all. When the air hostess intervened, the father of the child casually said, ‚ÄúNo, no it‚Äôs fine. We will land in 2 hours anyway.‚Äù The most common thing among desis in Western countries is buying stuff with the express intent of returning AFTER using. Many have turned it into an art form - what to say, how to appear belligerent, how to abuse the system shamelessly, etc. Thankfully, the ABCDs (next generation) are thoroughly embarrassed and want nothing to do with their parents' shenanigans. A few recent incidents:

1) I'd been to Yellowstone with family and there are these pools there which have a high concentration of bacteria and they shouldn't be disturbed for ecological reasons. There are SEVERAL signs saying ""Bacterial pool/mats, please do not touch"", but despite this I noticed some full grown adults that were a part of a huge Indian group touch and splash the water around. If not for the sake of the environment, at least have the common sense to not touch water that is literally filled with bacteria!! The most embarrassing scene was when this young Chinese child who was also a part of the tourist group shyly point to the sign and say ""no no"" that these adults noticed and didn't pay heed to. I'd finally had enough and approached these people and asked them to move away from the water because they weren't allowed to touch it after which they reluctantly moved. Looking at this scene this old white guy who was walking by mumbles ""Fucking tourists"". 

2) There's a park near my place where kids play and adults walk around in the evening. At the same time this huge group of aunties, I'm guessing housewives convene near the play area which is usually so silent and peaceful and start a racket loudly in Hindi/Punjabi, while their kids play. Laughing and gossiping about random things.. it's such a nuisance. No one's asking them not to talk, but maybe call your friends home and host the racket. I will never understand why it's so difficult for people to just fit in and behave like people around them.. The ""Why fit in when I was born to stand out"" quote has been taken too literally some some of them.

I haven't seen too many people misbehave here though.. what annoys me more is how they behave like law abiding decent citizens here and the second they return to India, throw garbage around, and behave badly. You come here and see how clean and beautiful everything is and after living here for a while, they sure as hell know how to maintain such a place, then why do they behave badly when they get back? Because ""Eh it's already dirty, nobody follows the rules anyways, everyone honks anyway so why shouldn't I do the the same"". A guy yelling at the Air hostess for not helping with his bags. His reason: he has heart issues and its her duty. He was so proud bitching about her the whole way that I felt so bad being an Indian. He even complained about her to all her co-workers. Never been abroad, so no stories to add here but that last one hurt. Well I live in Singapore but I swear Indian tourists(mostly) when alighting from the plane in either countries(or even other countries as a matter of fact) are in such a hurry like the doors are not open have some patience please

Also not to mention the loud talking. If u understand an Indian language u can easily know what they are talking about 1. Airports! Always! Worst one was at Charles De Gaulle, a flight to India, and the passengers had crowded the boarding gate, and were not willing to go sit down and line up according to groups. The gate staff were initially nice, then they got a bit firm, but the passengers were not relenting. The crew had to finally bring out the pilot or co-pilot, who was a Sikh Indian, who had to yell at them in Hindi to sit, and behave orderly, or they would hold up boarding.
2. Walking around some markets in Munich with my husband, we were minding our own business. This desi looking uncle, with his wife and kids is at the same stall. Suddenly starts chatting with us, which is fine. We exchanged pleasantries, then this peacock starts to tell us how he is an American citizen, has a big house in New Jersey (lol, who says that to a stranger), kids are US citizens, and some other supposedly-braggy bullshit. He only stopped when I told him we lived in Orange County, California. Cause apparently that one-upped him. This is why I dont like to talk to stranger desis. Its always a ""whose-dick-is-bigger"" contest.
3. I pre-select my seats on a flight, for personal reasons. Once on an SG-Mumbai flight, there is me in the aisle, a desi guy in the middle, and Indian aunty in the window. As I am arranging my luggage overhead, she makes an arrangement with the guy in the middle seat. Guy in window, me in middle and her in aisle. Why? Cause ""baaju mein gents aa gaye na"" She wont sit next to gents, but its ok for me to. (TBH i dont care, but hypocrisy much?). Then she said bathroom jaana padega. I said I'm ok to get up for you to go. She only relented when I told her I paid $20 to ensure an aisle seat, and she could have it if she gave me $30. 
4. If you sit in the back of the plane on a flight to India, you will notice, the red label will never reach you. The uncles will always finish it before service is over. :-P

Having said that, this ridiculous, entitled behaviour is almost always uncles and aunties. I've met some really nice people in their 20s and 30s who always talk about general things, offer travel advice and share their experiences. I always have problem with north indian groups traveling abroad. They are very loud in flight and they look down on Telugu/Tamil people. And also their funny English accent on a flight to Europe is more cringy. A (maybe) newly married couple complained about their pizza having only tomato sauce and cheese and ""none of the other toppings we get at Dominoes or Pizza Hut"". At a pizzeria. IN MOTHERFUCKING ROME, ITALY. [deleted] 1. On a flight to Singapore an oldie Aunty (50-55 years) and a middle aged man (Late 30s-early 40s) start chatting loudly in what sounded like Marathi to my northern ears. This was after the meals had been served and lights turned off on a 12 hour flight. A few old Australian passengers who were trying to sleep asked them as politely as one can to speak a little less loudly. The old lady went nuts with the usual,‚ÄùWe have also bought a ticket, we will talk as we like...blah blah‚Äù. The other passengers just pay back on their seats as if resigning to their fate. I don‚Äôt know why they didn‚Äôt call the flight attendants. 

2. There is loud and then there is Punjabi loud; and I know this because I‚Äôm one. A Punjabi Aunty in the seat ahead of mine talking loudly over the phone, telling the person to take in her ‚Äòkachera‚Äô (Punjabi for kuccha/underwear) on the washing line because it seemed like it was going to rain. This was just before takeoff and she didn‚Äôt shut up until the stewardess asked her to. 

3. On a Cathay Pacific flight full of Indians travelling from HongKong to Delhi a Sikh uncle (mid/late 30s) probably from Delhi asked the stewardess to carry his duty free wine in her luggage so he didn‚Äôt have to pay any duty on the load of alcohol he was carrying. The rest of the passengers were such a pain as well, as they kept walking around and not sitting down even after the pilot‚Äôs announcement that they were about to land. One guy kept trying to access his carry luggage when the seatbelt sign was on, for some reason until the male steward gave him a firm talk. The stewardesses were holding their heads in their hands. 

Many such stories but if you are one of the more enlightened ones, please go out of your way to change this image of uncouth, loud and rude Indian traveller. It might not be your making but it affects you as much as it will affect the people who are responsible for it. My worst flight ever, my personal flight from hell. AI Paris to Mumbai, December 14th, 2003. I took AA from Chicago to Paris, what I didn‚Äôt know was the AI flight was also Chicago to Paris with a layover in Paris. 

When I got on, a gujju lady was beside me with her granddaughter. She made a make shift camp bed infront of our legs for her kid. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2, it was impossible for me to move. As a meek 17 year old then, I didn‚Äôt say a word, not that it would matter anyway, she didn‚Äôt know Hindi, first time I realised not all Gujarati people speak Hindi. I even filled out their immigration leaflet before deboarding. 

I worked at a hotel in Mauritius for an year, surprisingly not many entitled Indian stories, even though 50% of our guests were Indian. My opinion:
1. Pure overreaction, can‚Äôt point this as Indian behaviour.
2. Ughh,  hate such idiots
3. Only beatings can cure such things
4. May be only such people get a pass to be there
5. While many country tourists are stereotyped for their behaviour and this one is just typical Indian. Indian family in an American restaurant they act like they are entitled to everything and act they literally own the restaurant. I work in a fine dining restaurant and we have jazz music every Wednesday. The family walked in demanded Indian classical be played by the band. WTF..... This is why most servers don't want an Indian table in restaurant and they won't tip no matter what. Was flying back from europe, had two inbreds in the seat behind me. They realised that alchohol on the flight was free and proceeded to hound the air hostess for drinks for the first 2-3 hours. Then once drunk they started watching videos on their phone without headphones. After a couple of minutes other passengers complained to the staff and they finally stopped.

After a few hours of nonsense like this, one of the apes decided that 8 glasses of airplane whiskey didn't agree with his stomach and decided to puke all over the aisle. So for the last 4 hours of my flight I had to deal with the stench of stomach acid and partly digested airplane food. \#5: had it been in US, both of those clowns would've been dragged out for some ""special interrogation"" I was in Australia for an onsite project.
In the community gym ,there was this particular indian women who used to bring her 2-3 year old grand kids to the gym . These kids were quite a nuisance.
 
I once told her that if your grandkids aren't interested in gymming ,then why are you bringing them . Her reply was ' Humne bhi paisa bhara hain , aap Kaun ho bolnewale '. i dont know about abroad but in hyderabad one guy standing in 10th row was pushing everyone to get ahead as soon as the plane landed. I tried to stop him but he pointed to his wife, I let him go thinking she was unwell. When i got down i saw him clicking selfies with his wife in front of the bus. Let's be honest, all countries/nationalities are assholes. Just see how white people go to developing countries and beg for us to fund their ""finding themselves"" trip

I know it's a lil whataboutism, but other countries already hate us. Just see how white people on Reddit are very quick to point out that we smell of Curry and spices, when they themselves can't properly clean their asses and smell of poop (bidet masterrace> toiler paper)

Seriously, don't get into this self hate thing. Majority of Indians are respectful, it's basically numbers game. If 10% of uk is annoying, thats 6 million. If 10% of India is annoying, that's 150 million I've seen a lot of us haggle the people from customer service for free upgrades/meals/discounts. The game plan is simple ,doesn't matter if its flight or a hotel or any other place in the hospitality industry. 

They go in with the cheapest plan/ticket/reservation and then look for some god damn stupid reason to complaint to the customer service reps. They wont stop stop complaining/arguing till they get something free, it could be a better room, better seat on a flight, free meal anything. 

And the worst part is that once they get something free of cost they will go and brag about this to their friends and family as if they did something great. Its so annoying listening to people and their cheap adventures. Number 3. as mentioned by OP, legit happened to me and a friend, the first time we were in Pattaya,we were turned away from a couple of establishments and when it made sense that this is because of being Indian we were extremely shocked. We had no other option but to show Australian ID and currency we were carrying to show that we came from Australia. Whenever I made friends with foreigners online they would, without fail, comment on how different I am from the Indians they see. It's an easy halo effect, so I don't mind. This was from Holi last year. There is a very nice little stretch in Jersey City, US ( one in the kal ho na ho ) and it‚Äôs really nice to just sit out there and look at the NYC skyline at sunset. 

Imagine my horror to see holi colors all over the deck and it‚Äôs just not isolated, there was pichkari stains and gulal and it was just disgusting. I mean fucking play holi but clean up after your mess. It was really disappointing to see that there are so inconsiderate people. Long line at immigration point at Helsinki Airport. A pair middle aged woman and man pushing and showing through the line to get in front loudly proclaiming ""we are senior citizens."" With that stupid hand gesture and head wobble. As if being senior citizen means something in Scandinavia. Get a bloody free wheelchair if you can't stand or walk. Going down from Zugspitze, Germany by cable car, this huge group of middle aged Indians shouting on top of their voices, ""How's the josh?...High sir!"". Was super embarassing to share the cable car with them smh. lol this thread is depressing I was on my flight from Jeddah(KSA) to New Delhi. Once on board flight attendant started handing out blankets to anyone who have asked. As soon he started distributing literally every Indian around started shouting on him Sir ji me, sir mujhe bhi, me me, here, sir here etc. it was so loud that it make everyone uncomfortable. At this point the flight attended said in Hindi, ‚Äò Bhai, yeh khana nahi hai‚Äô. Guess what, attendant was Russian. I've got something similar on three occasions;

1. I've travelled every year of my life since I was born as my parents lived and worked abroad. So, I've witnessed all sorts of chaos and woe that Indian's occasionally, bring in flights and the regular things like standing in the aisle even before the plane has come to a stop etc.I remember recently on a flight from the middle east a few people got up and made a queue before the seatbelt signs were turned off and the plane was still moving. One man sitting near the door, told them to stop making the queue so early and they said we've been waiting to return to India for a few years and he responds quickly, ""Jab saalo wait kar liya to do minute me kya jaiga tumhara. Baith jaiye.""On a few flights, I'd see people bring in luggage greater than the weight allotted to them and in order to evade the extra baggage fee, they'd stall the line for boarding pass and ask if they can check-in their luggage with us as we generally packed light for frequent travel. If we've had reached our luggage limit and politely refuse, they'd ask the next guy in line.
2. I was returning via bus from LA to SF and there was written baggage limitation on the bus ticket of two bags. It was also explicitly mentioned in bold red that no leeway would be given for extra baggage.Then comes this news reporter and her mother with six huge suitcases. Everyone has handed over their luggage and got it stored in the storage of the bus. I was travelling with an Indian friend at the time, we had one suitcase each. We're queuing up to get onto the bus and she's there arguing with the bus conductor. He refused to entertain them. He told them to either get on the bus or get off.She then seeing us in the queue comes to us and asks if we have luggage left to check-in. I agreed as it was delaying the bus departure and she got her way.When we went to the bus conductor he looked at us and then said that every time an Indian would come and they'd always exceed the luggage limit and we shouldn't let her get her way. I said, we're also Indian and if we have space, then do this once and we can depart quickly.We made the reporter promise to the conductor that she'd not check in more luggage on her return journey. She got all happy and gave us her business card, a reporter for some big News TV corp. We didn't care. But, the delay she caused in departure made everybody very angry with us. My friend even said, ""Jaane do inko! Phasne do! India smajh baithi hain ye log!"".
3. This one was unique; There was a guy adamant about smoking aboard the plane while in flight. Flight attendants and people will keep telling him to stop. He'd put out the cigarette and then light it again after some time. The flight attendant snatched his lighter he was hiding and cigarettes. Asked for his passport and visa. He was then promptly arrested upon disembarkation as soon as he was through the immigration check.

Please, everybody, when you travel, make sure you read the rules on the tickets ahead of the journey. There's been quite a few occasions when I witnessed Indian travelers acting really stuck up and entitled and treating service personnel like crap, though that mostly applies to the middle income crowd.  Try flying business or first class and every Indian passenger would make an average Westerner look like an uncivilized savage.  Switch to cattle class and everyone acts like they're one of the Great Mughals and demands they're treated as such. We were in Athens boarding the metro from the airport to the city. Since it was the first station, the train was stopped till its departure time. An Indian uncle was standing near the open door (just outside) and smoking. At least two announcements were made saying that the train is about to depart, so please board. This guy just put one leg inside the train and waited. Then the doors started shutting, and he tried to claw the door open  multiple times. Since the doors weren't shut, the train couldn't leave, and he wasn't strong enough to claw them open completely. He finally managed to wriggle his leg outside, and the train was able to leave. There is a statue called The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen, Denmark. I saw grown-up Indians trying to climb the statue (not too tall) to pose for a picture. Was on a flight from Dubai to LA and had a bunch of Telugu uncles (they tisko-cheezeko-ed their way to cowboy land) in the row behind me. They really were having a ball and seemed to be first time travellers based on the way they were trying to enjoy everything to the hilt. What really irked me was the way they would keep calling the hostesses - we were sitting very close to the pantry area, so they would just hail, ""Aye, babbyy, waater waater"" or ""Aye, bebbie, 3 beers"" or Aye, babbee, some chicken/nuts aa?"" since they wanted their drinks and chakna on their laps whenever their hearts desired. One of them would replace ""babbyy"" with ""medam, medam"". And do note, they didn't seem to use those words deridingly (no followup laughter and all) - they just seemed to know that those were the words to refer to a non-desi woman. What baffled me most was how the hostesses seemed to be completely okay with those calls and would respond to them every time with smiles and actually even serve them what they wanted. All that just confused and irritated the shit outta me and I did nothing but just sulk. ""Burger hai bhaijaan, bomb nahin"" would also be an appropriate line to say after one rips out a nice fat one, which is quite common from our countrymen and women on such long flights, what with all the airline food and beverages floating inside. Indian uncles and aunties eating Biryani, Roti, Curd rice, Lemon rice in NYC near the charging bull statue. That's the worst thing I have ever seen because lot of other tourists come to that place. What's wrong with sharing a beer? Man the first story made me so mad . Why doesn't the DGCA start banning these entitled fucks from flying? A few years ago me and my father were at this pizza place in Arizona where you need to put your own boxes in the trash,and we saw this massive Indian family just leave everything on the table and then go. It was so embarrassing,the staff looked very incensed. My dad went over and apologized for their behaviour. There was a time when I came to know I was the idiot . 

So I was just walking in a town in South East Asia and I saw a girl selling fruit salad . I just said  her get me one in a loud tone just like we do in India and she was pissed like anything . I realised my folly when I saw a Caucasian couple buying the same stuff with so much civility . 

When you are travelling in a group , the whole group is as civil as the most uncivilised person . We went to a French bakery and they had this number plate on table system . Our girls went so crazy with selfies , food pics etc , it was literally a Commotion . French staff was really kind and just pointed out that please make sure that number is visible. 

To be honest , these white people overdo stuff. To much of ""Thank You"" but we need to be more humble as well. I was on a flight from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi, flying the new (at that time) Etihad Airbus A380 which is basically a double decker. The bottom I think was all economy and the top was business and the really fancy first class apartment style seats. A lot of people in economy were really curious to see the apartment style seats and asked the crew to allow them to go up there and they were obviously denied since that would disturb the passengers up there. 

When we reached AUH, everyone had to exit to the front of the plane where there also happened to be stairs to the top. A flight attendant was standing there to ensure that noone strayed to the top. As I was exiting, right in front of me was an Indian man with his perhaps 8 year old son. We could hear the attendant telling a lot of people on their way out that they wouldn't be allowed up there, so even though I was curious myself, I had decided I wouldn't ask to go up. 

As we got to where the attendant was standing, someone from the other aisle asked him a question and he turned to deal with them. The man in front of me, seized this opportunity to try and sneak past the attendant. He started climbing the stairs along with his son and had one eye on the attendant the whole time to make sure he didn't turn. The attendant did of course, soon turn, and had to give this man a dressing down. 

It was soo embarrassing.....a grown man getting told off in front of his son for not being able to listen to simple instructions, as if they apply to everyone but him :/ Well, mine must be the battery Park in new York City. All of us are waiting in line, when a Gujarati family, a old batshit crazy mother and her two sons decide that they are too good to be waiting with us peasants, so they literally go under the tape only to be stopped by security and given a surprise *insert surprised Pikachu face* that they're in the United States, not India. Then the sons try to cuss and scream at the female security guard (they're probably not frequent tourists and haven't got accustomed to the concept of female security guards) about random stuff and how they're gonna sue her of all she's worth. She calmly calls the cops on them and they are dragged away in a NYPD police car, with handcuffs, while the whites are muttering stuff about Indians under their breath, and my girlfriend and I are praying to whatever God exists that we look non Indian enough, and start talking in Japanese for everyone to hear. What I find frustrating on every inbound flight from Asian destinations.. People scrambling to get their bags out of overhead luggage compartments as soon as the plane lands and is taxiing..no one gives a fuck about safety and create total chaos putting the crew in a difficult place... It's not like you are getting anywhere till the doors are opened. Hate that such nauseating actions reflect poorly on the rest of us pleasant folk. >4.....

I really think this should be far more common around the world.  Caning is quicker, cheaper, and people will definitely remember it more than a fine. I do want to clarify, not all Indians behave like this. Just a few from rural areas and some uneducated. There are many decent Indians who do not do this. The later are increasing by the day as more people immigrate to urban areas and education increases. Stay where you are mate.",2019-07-31 07:13:00

Would love to hear from you guys. My notes on the original book are given below. Looking forward to your comments and suggestions and experiences and anything else you feel like talking about based on the summary/notes of the book I have provided below...

-------

""Letters To My Ex"" is a book by Nikita Singh, about a girl who runs away from her own engagement ceremony. She was supposed to be engaged and married to her own long time boyfriend but yet, she just freaked out and run away. She does not talk to anyone after that, and ten months in, she confesses to the boyfriend that she still loves him and makes him swear that he will do everything to earn her trust everyday henceforth.

I think it is a slightly less intellectual equivalent of ""Notes From The Underground"" (Men are Not Piano Keys) fame. The format is the same. Notes from the underground has notes, letters has letters. They are both viciously funny and about characters that are absolutely abominable.

Anyways, I started out writing my own response to the girl from the book and plan to publish it as a book of my own introducing concepts from neuroscience and philosophy and conflict resolution and the likes.

The original book is located here:

-----------------------------

These are my notes:

# On the Book

This books is about two people who met in college, were going to be married, but the woman ran away from the middle of the engagement ceremony and then they are again engaged.

As the author states, something essential connects them. This is very easy. They are connected by deformed ideas of love and a shared identity that they could not shed.

She panics because she does not discuss her problems and her idea of her future melts away right in front of her. And thereafter she does arbitrary things, does not communicate to anyone and when she meets her boyfriend and takes a look at him having moved on she falls in love with him again. And even he falls in love with her, again, because that desire motivates. And then he is self absorbed in his own way about her. And the girlfriend has no control over him. 

# January 
There's a lot of talk about the reactions she gets when she breaks off the marriage. Dad is confused, mom is angry and both of them are disappointed. Which brings in the next point. She is really, really confused at how she ended up being the disappointing one because she is not the one that disappoints, ever. Because she always behaved like the perfect daughter. And who is the perfect daughter? She does not know, she has an image in mind and she maintains it.

Then we get to see her first meet. What we realize is that she is reads a lot and she did not have time for appearances. She is a thinker. But she thinks a lot. Really. But does not have an internal discipline of truth maintenance. She falls in love with a legend. He is a cricketer. She has heard of him, and he cannot be controlled, can not be tamed, so she gets insecure around him and does not know how to behave. And she tries and dominate him, ""Do you like being ignored?""  Rolls her eyes!

And then there is the scene in which she breaks off her engagement. She runs away in the middle of it all because stress has been building up. And there after, she just starts thinking and feeling sad and keeping her thoughts to herself and being disappointed by life in general. She thinks that this is all turning out to be like other unhappy, sad, emotionless, married couples. And so the idea just freaks her out. And so she does not control and run away. Even in the middle of it, she wants him to come back to her, and run to save her. She is running away, but instead of thinking what she has done to him, she really wants him to come get her back. So. How. How in the world is it possible?

# February 
From a lot of the discussion it is somewhat apparent that she resented the involvement of her family into her life. There is some psychological projection involved as well. Their families are trying to conduct the affairs the way that they know is best. But after all this involvement, Needhi realizes this is not what she had in her mind. Which is to say, she had an idyllic vision of marriage in her head and the world just did not figure into that. So when that image broke, she did not understand what to do about it. The more the image changed, the sadder she got. None of this, she talked with anyone else.  


There is the theme of their careers too. Abhay joined the family business while Needhi did not know what to do with her life. Both are probably liberal arts students, but this is what attracted them to each other - their differences. Abhay is a cricketer and then works with family business. So both require team work while Needhi is a more independent person. This is the kind of person who would do something innovative when she grows up. The problem with Needhi is that she does not grow up. Even Abhay has a few problems to deal with, but since all he has to do is follow the rules it never becomes apparent that he is also immature. Now, major points are that Abhay is self assured and traditional, teamplayer while Needhi is open to new experiences, independent and a thoughtful person of a more gentle demeanour.


Yes, there it is. She has existential problems in life. Who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing? What is my purpose in life? What will bring me happiness? All good questions to ask, and answer, this is a worthy pursuit. Here, she is incompetent. That is the problem. She says she wants a weaker memory and that she wants to be less of a control freak. That is, she remembers every little thing without being able to let go, and even control is also an inability to let go. She has no concept of where her independence ends and where the world begins. She even blames Abhay for not loving her enough or stopping to love him, and this is after she breaks the engagement. So the problem that led to the freaking out at the engagement is being discussed two months after the engagement and it was someone else's fault. In fact, she blames it on him that he did not try to stop her when she was running away even though she wanted him to stop her and this is further proof that he had stopped loving her and she was angry when she was running away that she was not stopping her.

# March

This is where Abhay eMails her. And within this email we get to know one thing, she never picks up his calls. She does accept that this is cowardice, but this needs to be explored. Why does she not pick up calls? Why does she not respond to texts? Why does she respond to him now? This is probably because he was confrontational and formal and he asked her point blank. Why did she do what she did? And then she responds to him. Maybe partially because she loves him and that she never saw him this way. But she responds to him that there was a loss of feeling and that she was a coward not to return calls or texts. And that is there. So. Once the self absorbed image breaks down she starts to feel a distance. This would be repaired only through creative engagement with stress.

She has wrecked her brains but has no answer to his questions: why did she do it. However, Abhay talks about something that hints at her avoidance. She avoids calls. She avoids confrontation. She avoids meeting with Abhay when he is with some other girl and then she avoids getting into engagement. Needhi avoids everything. Needhi has a void inside her after all this avoiding.

Needhi has no answers regarding anything, but Abhay has a very concrete event that precipitated a change in the feelings: when Anamika kissed Abhay and he did not stop. Again, this hints at his lack of self regulation. There are two components: the meaning of the event and the pleasure of the event. Both are controlled by different subsytems in the brain. And this meant that he would not stop the kiss and go with the flow. This created dissonance in her head and wrecked everything apart. They decide to meet, why is that so? This is probably because they had a heart to heart and treated each other with their intimate thoughts so something built up. 

# April
The first thing that jumps out at us is how he just avoids all kind of conversation about the topics that matter. She just does not talk about things that matter to her, to the point that Abhay has to say that he will not accept that ""I don't know"" answer. So all this stupidity for three months? Just so that she could avoid facing uncomfortable situations. In the end she faced an uncomfortable situation because something in her was awakened by a conversation with Abhay. They talked. They talked about what was bothering them and so a little bit of love happened.

She talks about things that make her uncomfortable and gets very emotional, but absolutely refuses to discuss things, because she says there is no point. What she does not realize is that there has to be a point, of answering the question, ""Where do we go from here""? So she keeps ruminating, discussing and talking the same things again and again but she does not know what to do with the discussion. She does not have basic conflict resolution skills. All of this is just her feelings, but she herself does not know what to do with the feelings. 

After having two discussions, one in March and the other in April, about things that she did, she feels a little better. This is because things have moved further and Abhay has discussed and imposed his constraints. Needhi did not accept even to herself that Anamika's kiss had affected her. Which is why this was buried deep down in her psyche and the memories came back later when it was discussed. This is one of those things, she feels that if she does not talk about things then they will go away.

# May
May is her Tinder month. Here she meets three people. The first one is someone who genuinely cares for her, sees her confused and intimidated and guides her through the process. The only mistake he makes is that he does not ask her, but just goes on telling her about what he genuinely thinks is helpful. She feels he is imposing himself on her. And so she does not like it. Then she is surprised that he enjoyed himself and had a good time with her. She ghosts him.

Then there is the MNC guy who is really high up. She is really fascinated by all the work that he does and she really enjoys all the discussion. Now this could have been her ticket up, but even here she makes the mistake that she is doing nothing. She just talks about things, not about herself. This is ofcourse, the same mistake that every one makes, which is the presentation of an image to another person who is presenting an image while you have all these thoughts. All she had to say is, oh god this is so exciting and then all hell would have broken lose.

Then there is Dhruv. Perfect guy again. Does everything. Even stops calling her when she tells him not to. He is perfect in every way but she does not feel the spark. And how is one supposed to feel the spark. Talk! Dhruv, you are such a wonderful person. Oh my God. This is so amazing. Haha! And then he says something. And she talks about her own marriage. And he comforts her and they lean in. And that's that. 

# June
They have a chat in June where they start discussing some things and behave as if things are normal, or near normal. Abhay is chatting with her simply because there is a wedding coming up and he will be there with a girlfriend. Needhi takes the opportunity to give him a chance to have a conversation with her about her life. Now, the two of them have an understanding here that if one talks about her problems, she will simply not have to worry about coming across as weak. In fact that is a signal to come closer. She calls it breaking the ice. She could do the same with other people, but she does not.

She is talking about her coworkers, but she is fairly self obsessed. She has no ability to talk to other people and presents her interpretation of events rather than talk about actual facts.

There is all this talk about awkwardness, which basically makes me think, what the hell? Where is the maturity? Talk about the elephant in the room.

#July 
The one thing that stands out in all of this is Needhi's need not to have awkwardness. Awkwardness is assuming some convention, adhering to it, needing to maintain that and pretending nothing happens outside of that script. For all of Needhi's talk of her famillies adhering to some script, even this one is adherence to a script. Just the one that she chooses. She feels awkwardness, she has to be non chalant yet friendly and still not have to overcompensate. She just can not feel easy, until alcohol comes and solves the problem. Bekhuudi. A disinhibited state. Jaam ki zaroorat, hai jaise, bekhoodi ke liyey, bas ek sanam chahiyey, aashiqui ke liyey!

Needhi's friend confronts her about this and they have a conversation on whether they have really moved on or not. And then, she pushes and pulls. Slowly. She says they have moved on, then maybe they are pretending to have moved on. There is this issue, of imposing an image and pretending that things are a certain way when they themselves don't know how things already are!

Then finally it happens. They both see each other in their prime. Abhay is non challant about everything, because, of course, he has a girlfriend. Needhi becomes vulnerable, partly because she is already in a weakned state because her identity has been broken while Abhay is already there. So she is hungry and in awe of Abhay. And there he is. Non challant! As she says. And so she is weak and beautiful. Abhay takes a look at her and his primal love is reactivated. And she thinks this is love, which partially it is.

# August
She has a mix of depression, anxiety and fever by now. She thinks she was moving on, but then again, she does not move on. The body is different from her self image.  She says she wants to do something, but the body just does not respond. Of course it won't. This is textbook creative stress. Change will not happen in such a manner. And that is the point, she has to confront everything. And had Abhay never really gotten back to her, she would have had to move on and deal with everything, but no, that is not how it happens.

Abhay talks about being distant from his girlfriend. What is going on is that his mind has been occupied by Needhi. Simran is automatically put in the backseat. He keeps on blabbering about how he gave all of him to her but that was not enough, and that introduces us to a new concept. What do you mean giving it his all? So, that is one thing.

She felt better when she had run away, temporarily. But now she is devastated. There she had to confront the fact that life would not be like she imagined it to be so she freaked out. Now she has to confront the fact that she still loves Abhay and she does not have him in her life and so she freaks out again. And this time it is major, because she has to do something. But then, she gets it all without doing anything. She is basically a slave to her feelings. Later on we find out that what she just blurts out everything to him. That is all that she does.

# September
She is reminiscing about their times together. Needhi freaks out always because she has no endgame in mind and when Abhay scolds her or tutors her or lectures her she gets defensive. But the point is that she is reminiscing. All the good memories are coming back.

She admits that they never had any such problems at the time. Why? Because they had nothing to do, really. All they had to do was be in love and enjoy the feeling and keep performing the same identity.

The one thing that I keep missing out on here is that she is doing really badly in her career too. She does not have her shit together. This is form an existential standpoint and also the fact that she has no identity to work from. This is precisely what ego does, it does not settle, it does not sacrifice. It does not know what to do.

# October
She finally gives in. First there is the rumination. She finds a hundred reasons for them not to be together and then she finds a hundred reasons for them to be together.

Trust comes up over and over again. They have trust issues, yes, of course they will have because they are both unable to deal with anything, they have no binding reality and they act on their whims. 

Even though she has been making Abhay dance all over her tune, she blames him for kissing Anamika and precipitating this. She takes no note of the fact that she did not want to deal with it and suppressed the memory.

# November
Abhay is clearly still in love with her, but he is also torn apart. He is completely broken. She just left without an explanation, on a whim without doing anything really to be responsible towards Abhay. So he wants her but he tells her that he cannot trust her and she has to have made a good decision that she is fully in. They do not know what a decision is.

Abhay is made to feel guilty and he is already being manipulated by her unknowingly because he is making the promise that he is going to wake up every day trying to gain her trust. So now we know that they do not have any idea on how trust emerges either. The more important part is that Needhi has a very bad effect on Abhay and the children do not discuss this with their parents or other responsible adults.

Their idea of moving past trauma is to forget it, which is really bad. Cheating and abandoning. Well. What the fuck. Really. Also, I promise to be yours if you promise to be mine. Mine and yours. Also. What the fuck. Conditional love. It's not conditional, it's a contract.

# December
She feels 19 again.

They have a set of promises one is about playing devil's advocate.

They are marrying, but then since they have not had any commitments here, no concept and no growth what is going on is that they will break up again, brutally. And that is why this is a viciously funny book if you know what the fuck is going on. She breaks up with him and then tells him to marry him again and now they are going to marry each other without changing anything. So what happened, really? Nothing! This almost reads like an episode of Sillicon Valley.

AskIndia,We really need to talk about Flairs.,111,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-16 02:51:16
AskIndia,"Older, more experienced people of India: What will actually happen if I marry outside my caste?",10,4qepvz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4qepvz/older_more_experienced_people_of_india_what_will/,14,"Reposting from [here](https://yy.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/4qazaw/what_will_actually_happen_if_i_marry_outside_my/)

I am a 26 year old guy in love with my girlfriend from college in India. Both of us are working outside India in the same city. I am from Rajasthan and from Agarwal community. My girlfriend is belongs to a scheduled caste and is from Maharashtra. Both of us obviously don't care about the caste system.

Now my parents are against our relationship. They hate SC people in general. Some of the reasons they are opposing the marriage 

1. It will tarnish their prestige.
2. It will lower their standing in the community.
3. It will be difficult to find a match for my younger sister (7 years younger)
4. My entire extended family has hopes from me. (I don't understand this one either :P)
5. I don't know the best for me, they do.

Now I understand that they are orthodox and probably had dreams about my future wife. I don't expect them to change their views quickly (may be they never will).

What I actually want to know in case they never accept my girlfriend and I decide to marry her:

1. Will it really affect my sister's wedding?
2. What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

",rajasthaniConfused," >Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

It might if the people from your community are really hell bent on being orthodox & backward. 

>What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

These things are a state of mind according to me. If any family is economically secure then it should not give two cents about what people think or what people might say.  

My personal experience: I married a girl from lower caste community who is also my long time friend (both of us are Maharashtrians) My parents were cool about it but her parents were hell bent on breaking us apart & emotionally tortured my GF but she is amazingly strong & did not give up. There reasons were also the same as everyone gives, i.e. what will people say, we will not be able to face the community. Eventually her parents agreed for marriage(took 1 year to convince) & after 2 years I think her parents have slowly started to realize that it was right decision. 

At the end it is up to you if you want to go through the possible emotional atyachar of an inter caste marriage(which is obviously the great story to tell to your grand kids) or have a plain socially approved arranged marriage. I did intercaste adventurous (atleast to me) marriage. My wife is tambram and i am not. 
There will be problems and bitter feelings initially. 
Your first task should be to make babies (not joking here). That can settle down the dust. Also after you marry stay out of sight for some years.  Why? 
If you stay locally then you both have to visit relatives weddings etc that can cause frictions and can upset your wife if your relatives say something ridiculous. 

Stand up for yourself. This is your life. Don't let some 500 year old tradition drive your life. 

Good luck! 

Edit: stay out of sight = go back to foreign country again?  > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

If arranged marriage, it will effect in the sense there would be some assholes who wouldn't want to get married into your family. But do note that your sister is better off not getting married to an asshole of a family.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

This is a tough question. I can give only my view based on anecdotal evidence - do note that I live in urban area is south India.

It frankly depends on extended family. In the inter caste marriages I have seen, one girl's parents were boycotted by extended family for around 2-3 years. Petty snarky remarks in family functions, not attending wedding, avoid meeting etc. Her husband's family (except his mother) came around and rallied around the couple. In another couple I know, the guys parents are still pissed off (5 years now) but it was more because of love marriage rather than arranged. His parents/extended aunty club cribs on not following certain customs (like wearing mangalsutra), skin color etc.

So if your mom/dad care a lot for what the extended family thinks of them and/or the extended family is their primary social circle, and the social circle is casteist, their ""prestige"" can take a beating. However, you are an adult and you have to live your decision. I can't answer this question. But you may want to put in a serious or reddiquette tag if you are serious about non-trolling answers.  If someone is rejecting your sister because you married outside your caste then she shouldn't be marrying the guy anyway.

Just my .02 rupee. Here is what i think , I think you are making a mistake. Leave her now.

Here is why?

If you wanted to be with that girl , absolutely none of the objections you have raised would matter. No one and i mean no one has a right on your future life. You and your partner have to be the only ones to decide. So even by asking the question and in the tone you have asked, i posit that you are not really into her.

Drop it now, not for the reasons you suggest but because you are not into her.


 Honor Killing is a possibility... They'll hack you and your wife into pieces and feed them to the ~~goats~~ gaus.. 

But seriously.. Fuck the orthodoxy.. If you want Indian society to progress you need to break away from useless traditions and mindsets which your family unfortunately still apparently follows.. 

Screw your parents.. (Not literally).. Your sister will be fine.. Its not like she's gonna be married the next day of your own marriage.. 

Chill..Marry...Repent..  Evaluate the fact if the girl is really the one. If the answer is yes, other things don't matter. 

Time heals everything and when your parents/relatives realize that you made a good choice they will reconsider their position.  Editing a few spelling mistakes. > Will it really affect my sister's wedding?

Yes it will, Rajasthan in particular is a bitch about this. Both my sisters are Married out of community and trust me most of the family outright reject meeting my Dad because of this (I am not pushing for Marriage, my dad has no timepass so he is busy wasting his time on getting an arranged wedding done.). But the ones who do get ready fall into two bunch, one who are genuinely nice and progressive people and the second bunch who think this will be way of getting extra dowry from the brides family. So that's that. If you think you sister can find a or wants to find a partner on her own, then don't worry.

> What is ""standing in the society"", or ""prestige"". Do these things actually take a beating?

Asshat from the community will bitch about it for the first few years, after that everyone shuts up once they find out how well the couple is doing. If you are confident you will end up in strong marriage with your GF then do go ahead and not let the Samaj bother you. If you are both outside India, then why don't you marry there. Nobody will really care in a few years.",2016-06-29 23:21:13
AskIndia,[Shower Thought] Subsidies and cheap favours by political parties make people happy enough to vote those parties most likely because people have low standards due to poverty.,25,6voqzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6voqzs/shower_thought_subsidies_and_cheap_favours_by/,15,"Think about it.

We are studying foreign policy this sem. This is the point my teacher makes again and again. Indians are so busy with basic issues that the other issues including foreign policy are ignored. It is one of the reasons that the Indian foreign policy is so non aggressive. It is hard to distract the public with basics when there is a war going on. Compare that to that of the US where foreign policy is one of the issues of presidential debate. I know it's unrelated but we did it in class today and I just wanted to share.

AskIndia,PSA: /r/India Submission Flairs & How to Use Them,45,4fyjjl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4fyjjl/psa_rindia_submission_flairs_how_to_use_them/,33,"###/r/India submission flairs and how to use them

#Q: What are submission flairs and what are they used for?

A: Submission flairs are the text-boxes that appear next to your submission title when you post something on /r/India. There are various different submission flairs but we will get to each category later. The flairs help users in filtering the content of this subreddit. For example if you want to look at all the Political submissions then simply click on the yellow 'Politics' text-box next to any political submission and you will land up in [**this page**](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3APolitics).

#Q: How do I know what flair to use?

A: Use common sense, for example:

* **1. Reddiquette:** If you want a civil and focused discussion with NO off-topic comments, choose 'Rediquette'. We do not allow trolling and other unnecessary behaviour in threads marked as 'Reddiquette' threads. Please don't use this for 'zoke' threads. 

* **2. Policy:** All posts about central or state policies must be flaired 'Policy'. If your submission is about rural electrification or regulating app-based cab services, then the submission must be flaired 'Policy'. If you post a question about a policy then the post must be flaired as 'Policy' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **3. Politics:** All posts about politics and politicians in India must be flaired as 'Politics' (unless 'Policy' is the more appropriate choice). Even if the submission is about the fact that a certain politician has their favorite shoe-fetching airlines, the post must be flaired as 'Politics'. Again, if you post a question about Indian politics or politicians then the post must be flaired as 'Politics' and not 'AskIndia'. 

* **4. Science & Technology/Food/Sports:** These are self-explanatory. All submissions about sci-tech must be flaired as 'Science & Technology' as long they have no policy/political aspect. If the submission is about research on Zika virus then flair it as 'Science & Technology', if the submission is about allocation of central funds in Zika virus research then flair it as 'Policy', if the submission is about how a certain minister claims that his/her influence accelerated the progress of Zika virus research then flair it as 'Politics'. Same reasoning applies for 'Food' and 'Sports'.

* **5. AskIndia:** This flair is to be used only when you post a question and if none of the previous flair is applicable.

* **6. Scheduled:** For all the RDD submissions and other weekly/biweekly/monthly submissions. 

* **7. Non-Political:** When none of the above flairs are applicable use this flair.


#Q: How do I apply the flairs?

A: Once you make a submission, you'll notice a red button which says *Flair your post* . Click on it and choose a flair according to the submission's theme, then hit Save.
**Example**: https://i.imgur.com/FKs9uVI.png

If you are posting from a handheld device, then please use the following abbreviations in the submission title and the flair will be added automatically.

* Politics: [P], [Politics], [Political]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political], [Non Political]
* Net-Neutrality: [NN], [Net-Neutrality], [Net Neutrality]
* Scheduled: [Scheduled]
* AskIndia: [ASK], [AS], [AskIndia], [Help]
* Sports: [Sports], [SP]
* Policy: [Policy]
* Science & Technology: [TE], [Tech], [Technology], [Sci], [Science], [Sci & Tech], [Science & Technology]
* Food: [Food], [FO]
* Reddiquette: [R], [Serious], [Reddiquette]

#Q: Can I have multiple flairs for one submission?

A: No. If you are posting from a hand-held device make sure that you add only one flair abbreviation in the submission title. If you are posting from a computer you cannot select more than one flair anyway. 

#Q: So, what happens if I 'mis-flair' a submission?

A: If you inadvertently use the wrong flair abbreviation then we will fix it ourselves. If you are on a hand-held device and want to change the flair of your submission to 'Reddiquette' then message us and we will do it for you. 

If we see repeated misuse of submission flairs then we will have a chat with you, your submission may get removed etc etc.

AskIndia,"[Ask Reddit]Please advise, Balding and like a girl.",8,5hdfdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5hdfdd/ask_redditplease_advise_balding_and_like_a_girl/,42,"Hi, Randians. This is actually a throwaway account as my friends know me on reddit. As you may have already understood by the title, I am hopelessly in love with a girl. I know it sounds a cliche, but she is perhaps the most beautiful girl I have ever laid my eyes upon. I am afraid to tell her anything just because I am bald and am pretty sure she would reject my advances. This is not meant to be bragging, but  I am actually quite well settled for life in a secure job and being an only child, the legal heir to my parents' properties. I have come to terms with the fact of my baldness, but she is the only fact I haven't come to terms with. Everytime I see her, there is this feeling of overwhelming helplessness and numbness. Should I tell her of my love for her or should I just forget her and resign myself to my fate? The latter is a scary thought, but seems to be the better alternative as I am afraid her rejection would destroy me from within. Please help a brother out.
*Edit: Kindly ignore the [askreddit] in the title, wanted to write ask india:)

**Second Edit**: Sorry if i came across as childish or immature. Truth be told, i was drunk when i made this post and perhaps it impacted my replying to some of the posts. Some of you have suggested  
to talk to her and not make assumptions about her. She is actually fully aware that i like her, and as one friend has rightly commented below that it is a case of one sided love. Perhaps talking to her is the only way to get out of this misery. I have decided to do this in the next week. My birthday is in Feb. and I pray to God that by that time i would be able to invite her to my b'day party. I will give an update, irrespective of the result. Thanks to all for your suggestions, it really means a lot :)",full_time_thug," Are you good looking and bald ?

>well settled for life in a secure job

This is more than enough. 

And don't worry about bald. Work with what you've got. Make that work for you. 
And as /u/immediate_cock mentioned, Lift, Lift and Lift more. i think you are not asking the right question to right people. i mean i doubt sehwag sir is a member here ?

i mean you have clearly demonstrated you are  person of means. quietly go for what sehwag sir did and regrow the silky smooth hairs on your balding patch. ( find a way to excuse yourselves from your GF )


BTW nobody knows what your girl thinks? maybe she is not really into your appearance only and may come to terms upon new knowledge about your balding head. 

so there are two ways given above. sehwag sir ki clinic ka address twitter DM me poochna, aajkal wo baato ke chakke marne me champion hai.  [deleted] > I am hopelessly in love with a girl  
    
No, you're not.  Balding like a girl? Is that in anyway different from balding like a guy? /s Tell her but don't take it to your head, you know, whatever she says. She's just another girl. Also the hair on your head has little to do with attractiveness. And you'll get over the ""feeling"".  

Cliched line, but since you are afraid of her rejection: Be a man.

Theres nothing of the sort in the pvt sector. Are you in a govt job?  Go Heisenberg style.  Dude you sound defeated , chicks dig confidence . Shave your head , hit the gym and watch the panties drop . Your mileage may wary, I started balding in early 20s , shaved my head and had an active dating life . Now mid 30s , happily married . Confidence is the key not some filmi love  Saar, pliss to give me her number so that I can talk to her since you don't seem to be very interested. Talk to her for fucks sake or forget her. Worst thing you can do is hold on to her and waste precious time You're probably screwed. It hurts worse than anything, I know ;) 

- Alt a) If you got the stomach for it: Clean cut. Don't have her in your life. You'll miss her and it will hurt for a while. But the pain numbs after about 6 months, soon you'll move on. 

- Alt b) Remember: we most regret chances we never took. You say she knows you like her. Well, then you making a move will not surprise her; she might even like it (small chance). Ask her out, go have a few drinks, see what happens.  Dude if u think balding is a problem, then life has got some nasty surprises in store for you. You say you are well settled. Have you ever thought about the millions in this country who do not even have a proper meal everyday and are forced to sleep in open in this cold weather? I suppose not.

Yeah and not just the subreddit.  For /r/india's 13000+ members ,very less number of people actually comment on posts or post anything .

My wild guess is ,people refrain from posting because as soon as you make a comment/post :

-Someone will oppose you just for the sake of it on the basis of million odd technicalities. 

-Some douche will start correcting your English.(Some kids relate your poor English skills with your opinion on that issue.)

-You might run into risk of hurting sensibilities of 'Seculars' or 'Hindutvas'. And ,then its all about jumping on conclusions to prove points.

-You might break one of those sub-reddit rules.

or

-You don't have anything to say or don't give a fuck about the issue.

On an average, on each post ,there are two redditors slugging it out over the most ridiculous things. 

Thats why /r/india resembles /r/worldnews . Its all about posting some news,then start bashing Indian society & how things are fucked up . Lekin agar woh bhi nahi kar sake, toh bring in Modi Vs. Gandhi debate,& you are good to go.

If we could just tone down our condescending attitudes,maybe more people will start contributing on /r/india. Now what is seen is comments of same set of people on almost every post. that's exactly the problem with India,we have schemes and schemes of things,but no follow up to the end. /r/kannada Rarely Active?

AskIndia,"NEED HELP - People working in the IT Sector who have absconded a company in the past, can you please share your experience afterwards?",6,9afobq,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9afobq/need_help_people_working_in_the_it_sector_who/,11,"I joined a MNC as a fresher with a 2 year bond of 1Lakh rs. Initial 6 months was training period after which we would have been put into projects. However, I had to join a project within a month immediately after my joining. I joined a project with QA (manual testing) profile and worked there for 6 months. During that time, I realized that if I continue there, I wouldn't have too much growth into the future. I was also put into support work as well which means I was doing both testing and support work. I researched a lot, made up my mind and called it quits. I left using a medical reason and didn't go back to work.

After that, I joined a small company as a Jr. Java Developer as a fresher again and have been working there for 1.7 years. I have successfully transitioned from a testing profile to a developer one and gave one hell of a performance as well (as much as a fresher can give).

Now, I am thinking of a job-switch and I am confused as to whether include the 6 months spent at the previous company as work-experience or not? I don't have a relieving letter/experience letter from them. I do have an offer letter, joining confirmation and two random pay-slips from them. Do I put that experience in my resume and be honest to the next company about my past (this is what I am bending towards), or do I hide the experience and just show my current experience as the total experience? Moreover, If I decide to hide it, will it come up in a background check?

I know it's a long post but I need some suggestions.(I have been all over internet and discussed with other peers but couldn't decide on a final thing). Any help will be much appreciated. Thanks.

PS: I posted this in r/AskIndia already but couldn't get many answers. Hope this post gains more attention this time.",throw_for_bea," Even though your post is very long, the job you are thinking of switching to is not mentioned properly. Do you already have a company (to switch to) in mind or just going to join wherever you get? 

In my opinion, I would suggest you to NOT mention that 6-month work thing anywhere on record. Try to convey your thoughts about those 6 months in your interview. At the end, it's all about what they think about you in the interview. If they think that your 6 months was productive, it doesn't matter whether you have a document or not. Though I did not abscond, I had a couple of rough exits from some companies, I told it to Wipro, they called the company which I worked for and truth was twisted.... and I lost the job offer from Wipro, the HR in Wipro told me, better dont show it, because no company wants an employee with a bad history Just be honest and upfront. Why hide?. 

Say I worked there, had excellent training and learnt a lot. Unfortunately, my project did not give me enough intellectual challenge and did not fit well in my career roadmap. Hence, after evaluating few options and keeping my manager and team in confidence, I decided to move on and take opportunity that would make me happy.

Why complicate things?. If the company that you are targeting gets bothered by that approach, you need to ask yourself, do you really want to work for them. 

I don't think anyone will have time to really digg into what happened in those 6 months, rather they will spend time assessing if you are good enough for the job. And will you have clear free mind answering questions constructively instead of having something back of your mind like what if they find, what should I tell etc etc.",2018-08-27 03:23:51
AskIndia,Buying an apartment in Hyderabad,5,8dg2ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8dg2ih/buying_an_apartment_in_hyderabad/,4,"Hi everyone,
I am planning to buy an apartment in Hafeezpet. The total amount is 47 lakhs for ~1100 Sqft near main road. Is this normal price? I am not so keen on buying but my parents in India are adamant about it. Rent expected is around 15000 + 1500 maintenance. Planning to take a loan for 30 Lakhs and use cash 20 Lakhs.

Edit: I don't know why I am getting downvoted :( I just asked a question with the AskIndia flair!",mdocvar," When you said ‚ÄúParents in India‚Äù I am assuming you are abroad. Actually my parents also forced me to buy a house which was around 75 lakhs(chennai), but I didn‚Äôt . I don‚Äôt know about your age, income, risk appetite etc . Here is what I would do.

1) If I have 20 lakhs cash, bare minimum I would deposit in FD which would earn interest of 12,500/month. This is based on RBL bank interest rate.
2) I would then use 50% of this 12,500 every month to invest in stocks and 25% into mutual funds and keep the remaining as cash for rainy day.
3) if I have more risk appetite I would divide this 20 lakhs into multiple staggered buy for stock which I am currently studying. 
4) Rental income in India is not profitable plus you will pay EMI for probably 20 years which is again a burden on you.
5) there are beautiful EMI calculators online which will tell you how much you will end up paying for the 27 Lakhs for 20 years which is around 58 lakhs.

Is it worth it?? Meh....

This is just my thought...... Bro if you want to buy it because you and your parents need a place of your own to live and given that you can pay it off with the time you have left on your visa then it makes more sense. As much as I understand and appreciate  people living off a rented space because for them economically it makes sense. I would still suggest you to buy your own place it will give you peace of mind and moving every two - three year is not that fun on the top of everything intrusive flat owners.


   But if your sole aim is to save some money or create a new asset like this place as a future investment. Then I might suggested you should look for other investment opportunities, in that case atleast you will have a rough idea how much return you can expect off your money down the line.

  You can also check out r/indiaInvestments ask the same thing there maybe those guys could be of more help.

AskIndia,[Mod Post] Introducing new flairs for better organization of content.,53,3ecyjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ecyjp/mod_post_introducing_new_flairs_for_better/,33,"Dear subscribers,

A week ago we requested for feedback on introduction of new flairs for better organization of content and your consumption. We have deliberated on your feedback and we now support new flairs.

* **Sports, Technology, Food** - The title of these flairs are self-explanatory.
* **Scheduled** - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.
* **Ask India** - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.
* **Governance** - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts.  However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. **Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.**

We hope these new flairs help better consume and organize content. We would love to see more posts from our vibrant community.

Cheers!

**Suggestions on the following topics are welcome**

* Colour Codes for the flair (in case you have better suggestions or an overall theme look in mind)
* More Flair Categories

**Note:** We are aware of the CSS discrepancies at this stage (flair selector list is a little messed up and missing buttons in the sidebar). We would add these soon.

**Edit:** We renamed the Regular flair to Scheduled to better reflect the purpose of the flair.",r_india_mod," [deleted] Yo. Team, I think we need to explain governance better, or force it to have a submission statement to raise the bar for the discussion. You have introduced new flairs. But how do you sort based on them? I see only 6 categories on the right... More Flair Categories: TIL, History/Philosophy/Literature, LongReads, Entertainment/Arts

Color Scheme for flairs: Similar to r/science or r/technology

Theme: Even r/Bharat a mature sub, has vibrant colors, our theme is dull, should have colors which looks interactive. > Governance - Recently, our subscribers played a big role in Net Neutrality and tried to shape country wide public policy on the Internet. We would like to see more such traction on different fronts. However, please note that this flair is specifically for public policy related decisions. Each post with the Governance flair should be a self-post ONLY.

Thank you for this :) Add a bakchodi flair for posts like [this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3eiy7w/i_got_this_kind_of_spam_first_they_make_me_bhaiya/) Just wanted to complement you for the Ask India flair. It's such a relief from the regular political bashing. A job well done dear mods! Can we have a flair for Defence ? To club news related to defence, intelligence and strategy ? Can we get an '**Entertainment**' flair for posting Bollywood related stuff? I suggest including a ""health"" flair.  we need a new flair to tag all the Twitter posts.
I want to filter them all out! Niyam kanoon toh thik hai, pehle is post ko sticky toh kar do. > Ask India - For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations

:D - Much needed! Can we get an '**International**' flair ? why misleading? why would i mark my own posts as misleading? Great!! Thanks for the speedy implementation! The flairs that you chose are great and will definitely help! However no call on the pol threads? >Regular - This flair will be associated for regular threads like RDD, Books, Movies etc. The introduction of this flair is to encourage more such weekly threads by our subscribers. We would love to see regular threads on our sub.

What is RDD stands for?? Random Digit Dialing!?? Can you guys change the colour for AskIndia flair? [deleted] short cuts for mobile users? > Ask India - This flair relates to any question that you'd like to ask the r/India[1] community. For example, arranged marriages or which positions to have best sexual stimulations.

 I only have to say one thing .It seems from the eg /r/india mods put up like we Indians only care for sex and shit , there are tons of eg to put up. This doesn't look .. well good especially on a stickied post of most subscribed Indian sub.

AskIndia,"[R] Updated Wiki, Rules & Flairs",33,3huilc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3huilc/r_updated_wiki_rules_flairs/,98,"#Comment Moderation in Political & Religious Threads

* Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.
* Slurs and invectives - we need to participate in discussions without resorting to juvenile name calling.
* Flaming the forum, that is, asking ‚Äúwhere are the people of X party or Y group now‚Äù adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed. 
* Serious, on topic, high effort conversation. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
* **Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.**

The basic premise is that your comment should be constructive and should add something to the discussion. If all you are looking to do is pick a fight, then /r/India is not the place for you. 

#The Governance Flair

* **Would be renamed to Policy**. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government (or new policy discussions that /r/India participants want to focus on) and applies to self-posts as well as link-posts. 
* **Comment Moderation would be similar to Political Threads.**
* To ensure that the focus remains on the policy aspect of a political post, users **must** add a submission statement limiting the discussion to a specific policy issue, and/or a specific policy correction.


#Low Effort Political/Policy/Religious Posts

* Link submissions that refer personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a self-post (accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions; @PMOIndia is allowed). 
* Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.  
* Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.
* Similar rule applies for image submissions for political/policy/religious posts. OP must cite the source for the image and accompany the image submission with a statement regarding the topic he/she wishes to discuss.

#Unverified Posts

* Info-graphics, images, selfs posts and other similar content which makes (an) assertion(s) but lacks (a) source(s) will be removed. The original submitter [OP] should post the source (if it is not cited in the submission itself) as soon as possible. If the OP receives a message from a moderator stating that their post has been delisted [removed] due to lack of source, they may still provide the source and the the submission will be relisted [unremoved].

#Editorialising

* Editorialising is not acceptable. Editorialising is simply the act of inserting an opinion into a (submission) title. You should, in most cases, use the title on the page you are linking to. 
* However, in the case of YouTube, you may have to be inventive and attempt to create an **nonpartisan** and **neutral** title if the one the YouTube video uses is clearly partisan and bias.

#Subreddit promotion via user flairs

* You are allowed to promote any subreddit with your user flairs as long as the subreddit you are promoting is listed under the [list of India related subreddits](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/related_subreddits) at the /r/India wiki. 

#Mobile Flairs
* AskIndia: [Ask], [AS], [Askindia],[Help]
* Sports: [SP]
* Technology: [TECH],[TE]
* Food: [FO], [Food]
* Non-Political: [NP], [Non-Political]

> * **Link submissions** that refer non-personal and verified Twitter accounts can only be made if the OP substantiates his views in a **self-post**

1. A self-post? Do you mean a comment?
2. Do you mean ""non-personal verified"" instead of ""non-personal and verified""?

> Direct submission to non-personal and unverified Twitter accounts for political and policy posts is also not allowed.

Isn't submission of unverified account anyway not allowed?

And so the only twitter accounts that are allowed for direct link submission are ""non-personal verified"" accounts like @PMOIndia, right? >Similarly, if you wish to cite an unverified Twitter account for a political/policy/religious post, you need to do so in a self-post (after hiding personal information from said tweet) and substantiate what you wish to discuss in the thread.

In such a submission can the name of the twitter handle be mentioned in the title? Have seen a few such posts in the recent past. All of this is going to lead to  more controversies.  Ok, I almost never checkin here except when I do the odd RDD thread but I cannot believe this kind of policing is still happening!

What kind of a place has this turned into that it's making normal everyday indians who are more worried about the kujhli in their underpants to be this aggressive brand of assholes? Here we go again. More and more poorly thought out rules, imposed on the subreddit without any discussion. 

Indians are political and argumentative people. You mods cannot wish that away with your silly rules. Just let the sub be instead of trying to sanitize the discussions. 

This is a chai stall at a railway station, not a formal dinner in Victorian England.  Why is so much importance being given to political/religious threads? 

Why isn't the 'no low-effort' rule being applied to all the threads and posts? 

Man, either apply the rules uniformly or don't apply them at all and let us decide if something is high or low effort. I have seen the 'no low-effort' rule in other subs too but they apply it to everything. More subjective rules with loopholes as a pre-requisite and a necessary design criteria. 

Now, there is no way to differentiate between these two. 

1. This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.
2. Political humour posts are exempt from these rules.

So, basically, when our **subjective call** says that the user is ""*Flaming the forum*"", we can insta-ban the user. But, we can use yet another **subjective call** to claim that a different user was just indulging in Political humor. 

Just let this forum be. Why the fuck do we have religious threads This is how you make a Dead Sub. I've seen /r/india's rules worst so far. The twitter rules are fucking irritating.  >This means most jokes, memes, non-contributive comments will be removed.

WTF. Why can't you guys just let the sub be as it is without adding new rules etc for even one month?

>Would be renamed to Policy. It applies to any new policy decision announced by the government

I don't understand the need for a separate flair for this. Such discussions should be under Politics. [removed] Less objectivity, more subjectivity... I can already see numerous ways in which these rules can be twisted and interpreted to suit a person's personal biases.

>Low-effort comments that don't contribute to the discussion will be removed.

What criteria will be used to decide whether a comment is low-effort or not? Mods' subjective views?

>asking ‚Äúwhere are the people of X party or Y group now‚Äù adds nothing constructive to the discussion and will be removed.

Okay, so if supporters of a particular party bash another party based on a false report(as has happened so many times), and later on the truth gets posted, can we not ask where the bashers are now? Whats wrong with that? Nice. Also please try and do a full revision of the rules. Like all the rules at one place. Hallelujah!! Thanks for this! Are these rules going live along with post, or are you looking for building up opinion and then implememting it? 
 Agreed with the policy for political threads, but not religious threads. As rational people we should be allowed to ridicule religions. Not adherents, but the religion itself. 

If I wish to call Mohammad a paedophile, Yahweh a genocidal maniac or Indra a pussy-man, there shouldn't be a ban on it.  Could you sticky this, please? >accounts like @narendramodi and @ArvindKejrwal are personal accounts and therefore not allowed for direct submissions


WTF? Also, /r/IndianPeopleFacebook should be listed under related subs. 

/r/IndianFootball too. Oh, NSFW Indian subs too. Why the discrimination? What about genuine criticism of some aspect of a religion? For instance, me calling radhe maa human diarrhoea posing as a Hindu, rather than, say, calling Hinduism diarrhoea in religion form. So where exactly are you drawing the line?",2015-08-22 03:07:11
AskIndia,[R]Feedback thread the sequel. Results and announcements.,32,2o2rpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/2o2rpl/rfeedback_thread_the_sequel_results_and/,256,"Dear Subscribers,

Thank you for all the comments and thoughts on the feedback thread. Based on that here are the most popular suggestions and our decisions

**Edit** - **check out the clarification about user's posting history, please**

* Bring back old ‚ÄúUnited We Stand Banner‚Äù - **done**

* New link flairs  to be introduced - 

   * Old article (older than 6 months)

   * Technology (phone reviews)

   * Arts (bollywood, music, books, poetry)

   * Finance

  * Twitter

  * Sports

  * AskIndia


* Clarification on Flairs: User flairs have been enabled for a few months now. Just a reminder though, any flair which breaks the css or the reddit default format will be removed. Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

* Score hiding - **This is a reddit feature which hides votes/total score for a set interval. Since we're constantly the target of voting brigades, we'll be hiding scores for an hour to break up the voting patterns and make sure that comments are voted purely on the basis of merit. Scores will be hidden for 60 minutes. Subscribers will still be able to see the scores on their comments.**

* Selecting the next moderator - **Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india debate on the people in the list. Expect more details in a separate thread.**

* About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - **looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.**

* Repost removal policy - **all reposts/same news will be directed to the first post it's category. The repost window will be 4 hours long**

* Personal Attack Rule Review - **No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now**. 

* Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? **Yes.** 

**Edit** - As long as you bring up the history of the person you're actually talking to - and not name drop some other redditor it won't count as a personal attack.


* Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof, but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation. Additionally cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india on the subreddit's request. Please keep other subs' rules in mind before posting here. For instance /r/polandball does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit. We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc. Please also note that in some cases there are delays because the mod in question might go offline thanks to timezones.

",i_am_not_sam," what about flair for **science** lets discuss science articles also , it will be very useful for learning new things  [deleted] >but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation

This is quite a violation, no?

I'm sure you will say that if you want to critique, bring it up within /r/india and not outside? But /r/subredditdrama can, while indulging in schadenfreude, still keep us on our toes instead of giving one the feeling that critique is being swept under the carpet. [deleted] I have hidden the score for 60 minutes for now, but I believe given the traffic in /r/India the comment scores should be hidden for 120 minutes. Thoughts? Can the OP be Highlighted more clearly? Its just a more saturated blue, which isn't easy to figure out. For example, most subs have a Blue Background box behind OP name when submitting comments. Can we at least get some Indian mods? Someone who respects Indian sensibilities? Someone who understands, recognises and agrees with the democratic opinion of the country? 

Actually, I know the answer. Take it up your own modmail. 
 > * Clarification on Flairs

This clarification has been a long time coming. You should have given this clarification *before* banning people from the sub for it. Anyways, better late than never.

> * Score hiding
> * New moderator
> * Repost removal

All good steps. I congratulate the mod team. Why has this thread been posted so late in the night?

Wouldn't the more logical thing be to post it during India hours when most active subscribers are awake? > Since we need a new mod in the near future, we will ask for people to sign up/nominate themselves. We will be holding elections in a few weeks.

So someone like hindusanghi123 will be the next mod now? > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.
 
Nope. It's become a lot more intolerant community which believes in violently criticizing groups of people or people in public but cannot take a personal insult when called to question on it. If you delight in shaming people you don't know from the comforts of your keyboard, it'd be hypocritic not to be ready to take insults in return.

> Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bullshit. So is the unverified twitter account rule.

> Cross Posting: You may cross post threads in the line of /r/bestof , but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama will be removed without hesitation.

Can (and is) abused. Use Meta flair for this.

> Score hiding

The crappiest parochial thought fart someone ever had.

What's the problem with them? Bad titling?

> Additionally, please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. The place to ask for removal clarifications is modmail not the subreddit

Absolutely no point to this. Leave it to the user's intelligence.

Adding a question, why is **pure theology** as /u/rahulthewall puts it is **banned** in this subreddit? Isn't this also a sub where history is discussed. A verse of the Rig Veda was banned while an article talking about Hindu mythology in medium.com was allowed. Clarify your stand. If you're supporting banning it in the future, that's stupid.

The twitter flair is a nice idea BTW. score hiding will be awesome. good job mods!

ps. would never want to become mod. too much hardwork. you guys are good keep it up Can you put multiple flairs on the same post? i.e. if I post an article which is more than 6 months old about a political subject - what should I flair it as?   

What if it's a Twitter comment which is political and more than 6 months old?   
 >Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

Bad

>but anything even borderline /r/subredditdrama

Bad

>For instance /r/polandball[6] does not allow xposts to communities as large as ours.

Bad.

Everything else sounds great.
 [deleted] Points are still visible on mobile or if you disable CSS, right?  Are you guys still taking the feedback? If yes then I suggest to NOT include AskIndia flair but instead redirect those to /r/AskIndia. Like /r/europe has on the top.

Also sometimes exact title rule doesn't really tell what is in the article. So for that something like *editorialized* flair should be there.

And now some queries - how much time should we wait for the mods to respond if the modmail is sent? Does *Repost removal policy* apply only to that article from one source or other sources too? Because different sources have difference in how the story is presented >About ScoopWhoop/Storify/Buzzfeed - looks like these sites have now gotten mainstream with a lot of non-spammy users submitting links from them. Please use voting to keep clickbaits down and we will ban new spam sites.

You don't have to ban all links from these sites. Just the ones that have embedded YouTube/Vimeo videos. 

Also, could you guys have AutoMod notify us every time a comment that breaks the rule is deleted. I use c*unt a lot, and it seems to be a word that is monitored closely. Often I've noticed that my comments carrying the word get deleted even when used in a non-sexist or satirical context. I would like to know if/when any of my comments are deleted. I don't see what's wrong with it.  Thanks for the flairs!

Edit: I still see two flairs only. Not activated yet?

Edit 2: Ah I see.  > Personal Attack Rule Review - No change. The community is a lot better since we undertook all the trouble to cut out the slurs. We'll keep this rule going for now.

> **Can bringing up a user's posting history be classified as a personal

No kulcha flair? Nice Work , When it will be done ? > We respond to the best of our abilities and fast as we can, excuse any delays on weekends and holidays etc

What about those cases in which no reply is received even after several reminders?

> please bring your objections to modmail, because we will not allow any negative community meta or drama posts. 

Again, you only pick and reply. The community should know if the mods are showing partisanship. 

> Is bringing up a user's posting history can be classified as a personal attack? Yes.

So basically I'm allowed to say one thing today and say something completely opposite tomorrow? > We will then create a shortlist and let /r/india[1] debate

Score hiding for an hour is good too. Please extend that to comment scores as well.

Could we have a ""Uplifting News"" flair? I have been requesting for this for a while! Plis to include me on mod nomination plij.

I think this sub can use a right of center mod. :P

 >  Any flair that targets individuals will be removed. 

Can a person abuse himself/herself in the flair? My flair e.g. All I have to say is, please make sure the next mod is not a liberal. ALL of the mods are liberal as of now. Approved  Can we have some information about RTI in the /r/india wiki?


Also why 

> cross posting from /r/pakistan in comments or as posts is banned on /r/india




 Still zero feedback for why the mods seem terrified or simply unwilling to take any action against certain posters of a 'secular'/Leftist political bias with a habit of targeting others and the r/india community as a whole.

Are these posters mods or admins? Is that why they are completely immune and get a blank check to do whatever they like? Please clarify.  BTW mods, I'd appreciate if you applied the 'won't show downvotes' rule for new threads as well, because me and other posters identified as 'bhakts' or 'Sanghis' have been facing very furious and concerted downvote herding from r/india's 'secular' posters and lurkers. 

Every new thread I've posted in the last couple of weeks has been quickly downvoted to keep its score near 0 and usually certain posters keep topping that up every few minutes to ensure it never gets more than a few total votes and stays far off the front page.

Moderators of /r/India here (using a common account).

###Flairs

We promised to give you flairs, and we have not kept our promise. So, here goes. We suggest the following flairs (and if there are any that you want to see added, please suggest them)

* AskIndia
* Governance: To separate policy decisions from Political Posts

As mentioned above, please suggest new flairs that you would want to see. 

Now, let's address discussion in /r/India threads, especially political posts. A few ideas. **Do note that these are only ideas, we are not implementing them. We are only looking for your opinion**. 

###Political Posts

* No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.
* Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced. We want to implement this, but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this. 
* Remove low-effort political self-posts. 

### Non-political posts

* Same rule as politics for Twitter post (and other social media screenshots including memes). Specify what you want to discuss and substantiate your stand in a self-post. /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards. 

Please feel free to disagree with all the points made here. :)
",r_india_mod," Could you improve wiki? Many times a post/comment is removed citing some non-existent rule. And you don't allow to make meta post about it. Which I can understand because you don't want drama. You ask to send mod mail. We send but then you don't reply to mod mails too. 

* Remove politics from this sub. Like /r/unitedkingdom has /r/ukpolitics, /r/canada has /r/CanadaPolitics, /r/australia has /r/AustralianPolitics etc remove political post and direct people to post in /r/indianpolitics. It will improve this sub.

* Make things transparent. /r/Futurology has /r/FuturologyModerators/ and /r/FuturologyRemovals/ where removed things are recorded WITH reason. /r/technology has has their automod configuration public /r/technology/wiki/automoderator. Use a meta sub to which allows easier communication and discussions. Case in point /r/metacanada 

* Add this post and other mod announcement posts in the /r/india wiki.  [deleted] >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

If I have to explain my meme or image in a self-post it is kind of counter intuitive, no? 

I mean, a picture is supposed to be worth a thousand words. My two bits:

* Remove the political post/politics altogether from this sub.

 our life is teeming with enough politics already be it newspaper or news channel with blaring mindless debates airing all day. And since many redditors have complained about the same in many self posts it seems like the right time to do so.
You can direct those who wants to discuss that to something like /r/indiapolitics if it exists or make one for them like many other countries sub did , if still you see people have this great uncontrolled urge to discuss which politician wrote what on twitter and those other shit you can always give them a warning first and if they don't comply then ban them from this sub(not shadowban,let them know why they are banned).

*  I'd suggest some flairs like **arts, sports and religion**. More flairs will keep different posts from getting mixed and people interested in a particular thing probably won't downvote the stuff they are not interested in and new genuine posts in their respective category will hopefully get a breathe of upvote from interested people. +1 for no political twitter spam > Remove low-effort political self-posts

Please elaborate on this?

Also, you guys to need to ensure greater transparency in your process. >No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. If you want to submit an image or a twitter post, create a self-post and explain what is it that you want to discuss about it.

I don't think this serves any purpose at all. The reason these memes and tweet links exist is not for OPs to score cool karma points, but to reinforce his/her own political views. So self post or not, these low effort posts would continue to clutter the feed. 

>Remove low-effort political self-posts.

You will need to elaborate on this or else you are going to get accused of muzzling opinions.  Since there is an announcement, I want to bring up couple of points which affects the quality of discussion here.  These are tangentially related.             
Does this sub have an official stand or voice on any issue? Is it a place for discussion only or reddit India supported activism?  For example Net neutrality debate. I think the official voice of redditindia should not get into activism irl. It encourages brigading and suppressing contrary voices.          
I think it was wrong that redditindia took an official position on contentious issue like NN which lead to brigading in real life.  Shouldn't have happened.            
Second, do we need the twitter account of redditindia to tweet hot posts? And is there a criteria. I  have seen low effort self posts getting tweeted. I  see that as an encouragement. 
 Ooh.. common account as a mod.. 

*interesting*

Governance flair sounds good. Hopefully we'll have more discussions on that.
 How about a flair to seperate the faking news/unreal times articles from the real news. > Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Yes and yes. >but we have fallen short because we don't have enough active moderators. We would need to hire more. The problem is we need to find people who have the time and inclination to do this.

Any other conditions? Wheeee flairs!!   
TIL, LPT/jugaad, ELI 5, ITAP, TOMT, throwback for old awesome posts that newcomers can enjoy like out of loop.     

But can we also have something against down voting self posts into oblivion?     
 [removed] You people tried to moderate political thread last time as well it didn't work. Politics is the major subject on this sub and unless you double the moderators keeping political posts strictly r enforced will be hard.  [removed] Having to explain memes kind of spoil the fun. And that also kind of deters the content makes (Who am I kidding, no randian makes original content). Even then, atleast its possible in the future. Aand thats how you make a dead sub...btw instead of these useless flairs why not make a ""Delhi"" flair to filter it out all the useless AAP posts. I have a moderation related questions.   

When Moderators delete a post, I have seen 3 kinds of things happening.

1. A comment is posted to the thread about why it was deleted   
2. A [deleted] message appear on the self post    
3. Sometimes neither of the 2 happen, but the post still disappears.    

So what's the difference? Why not a message in the thread any time a post is deleted by moderation?   
 Add a flair for geopolitics.  AskIndia is good but I don't think Governance flair would be used often. Rather, have a Weekly flair for regular posts. Another suggestion, have a BJP/AAP/Congress flair along with Political. A lot of people want to read political news not related to these 3 parties.  Rules rules and more rules....At this rate One day you will have to delete all political posts and move it r/IndianPolitics  > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter. 

no direct submission to posts made by verified twitter handles makes no sense. make this rule about unverified twitter handles.

verified twitter handles serve as news source, and you have policy of not editing the news headlines, but you want users to editorialize  the 140 character twitter posts. That defeats the purpose of twitter, as a platform.

 Please could you add a crime flair. We get quite a few of those posts, and one for the counselling needed type relationship posts.

How do you define low-effort political self posts? Also what about low-effort political comments in political posts? Can you guys have the automod say which words are censored from the sub so that when my comments get deleted I can remove the offensive words? Thx Mods can you bring back the weekly movies thread

They were being done earlier but then were disbanded dues to lack of popularity after some time

Now with the whole make /r/india better thing going on

I think it would be good time to bring them back, and see how they work now

Plus it would also increase semi-Original Content and NP posts

Maybe stickie those threads early on Whenever we have one of these posts, it is followed by another list of new rules. Can we just let things be for a while?  Please bring up new ways to help new redditers  [deleted] IMHO, you guys need to cut down on your stupid rules, instead of making shitty new ones. 

You guys remind me of the following story:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller,_his_son_and_the_donkey I can pitch in as mod and help out if you guys are okay with that. 

Edit: just saw the comment by the mods regarding signing up. Will modmail.  - Regarding ""no direct submission to images"" for [P] posts, could you please clarify the reasoning behind this idea? Doing away with memes and ""caption this"" makes sense, but why all images? For example, would an image of a politician slapping someone not be relevant content which would not require any further explanation? Additionally, if you do decide to go ahead with it, why just images and not audio/video?

- Could you clarify what a ""low-effort"" political self-post would be? Would all such content need to be backed up by data or are opinion pieces also allowed? If data is to be made mandatory, how would you plan to make sure that the content isn't an op piece with some data just for the sake of sticking to the rules? [deleted] ""Governance"" flair is an interesting idea. Not sure how much traction it will get but it's worth a shot. There is a very urgent need to separate political bullshit and rhetoric from actual impactful decisions that political parties are taking.  I am very against these ideas of writing essay for self posts. I have already expressed my opinion [here](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3d8epc/is_noise_drowning_out_the_signal_in_rindia/ct2to3p):

> and low-effort content is always upvoted to the top

subjective. people upvote what they like

> Remove low-effort political self-posts.
> 
> No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.

it's censorship. mods shouldn't decide what is 'low-effort' and what is not. the members of community should.

and not everyone wants to read a essay about why submitted an image of some tweet. 

>  /r/India should not be the place to discuss WhatsApp forwards.

People like it. Let them decide what they want by uproots/downvotes.

 We need more flairs. Arts, Movies, Books, TV, etc etc. 

We need weekly threads for different topics. Can we automate this please?  Be more strict with with titles which are unverified and misleading. I see them not tagged Wrt flairs.

Try and choose a flair which is a unique set with minimal Overlap and a topic obvious from the name.

So for example governance could be policy. Entertainment I think would be too broad.

Sports is a good choice. I think DIY maybe of value. Ask is another option.  Please take care of posts which are low effort under political flair. Don't let them shitpost. For example like today 

Really low effort & shit post

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlxn8/proof_that_rss_is_literally_hitler/

One line statements from Twitter which creates cicrle-jerk

> https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3dlo0y/tell_narendramodi_to_remove_his_paramilitary_from/

Rather ask such people to make self posts or wait till any media house writes a full article on this. What is the point in creating multiple threads due to just one comment from any politician?

As we are growing, we are lacking space on the front page, news & politics keep on clogging up that space.

Please don't resent anything & be harsh on these assholes. You have my vote on this.

Please bring more flairs other than AskIndia/HelpIndia like Sports & Entertainment. Please have more weekly threads like those tech threads & also sticky those threads so more people comment. Thanks for taking the initiative, the new flairs sound like a good idea, implementing them, a far bigger proposition, but doable!!    
>Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced         

This needs to be done. I know it is a big task for the mods, but its the need of the hour! You can find people who are actually driven to do this, and if implemented,along with removal of low effort self posts, will be a welcome respite, and greatly improve the quality of political discourse in the sub.    

Again thanks for trying to bring about a change and I wish you guys all the luck to go through with it. you'll need it :) Could we limit the posts with personal questions and rants? They're almost always unverified, troll bait and conform to the subs circlejerks.

I'd love to see more moderation of those posts than deleting ""Chaddis vs AAPtards"" kind of comments. The latter get downvoted pretty often, anyway. Could you post some guidelines about downvoting that people will see more prominently when they are about to downvote?

Right now whenever someone sees something they don't agree with, it is downvoted to oblivion and it fosters a kind of circlejerk where you only see the majority opinion and anything that disagrees just disappears.

Other options might include keeping the threads in contest mode for a longer time. I used to avoid /r/India like the plague, but now I'm starting to see a lot of intriguing discussions. I still disagree with some people, but we are able to discuss in a logical and informed manner, as opposed to the childish, irrational, and chauvinist way people were a while back.

Re-subscribed. 1. Strictly objective rules. Remove all subjective interpretation from rules. This continues the situation of ""we have fallen short"" remark. When there is no objectivity, two people can have a different opinion about the same comment, and then a rule ceases to be a rule and becomes an opinion. 
2. Self posts for images. Well, there is already a work-around and loophole in current rules where users can post a collage of more than one twitter screenshot and not use exact title rule. Self post provides an easier editorializing of the title. Exactly how will this help reducing shitpost is unclear to me. 
3. New common account that is purely for communication. Does this mean you are now willing to discuss controversial mod decisions in public? This will help the community to understand the thought that went behind deleting some comment or thread and what was the subjective reasoning used? Unless subjective decisions are discussed and debated, these rules are just anchors of imposing your opinion on mod activities. Any comment can be constructed to violate any random rule because ""I felt so"" without any accountability to the community! Modmail is just a safety net because you are afraid that you may have been wrong and 15 people collectively pouncing on one person is better that 300+ people pouncing on the mods for a wrong decision.  Media,Random,Other.


I guess these will be cool flairs. [deleted] Good points...personally, am in complete agreement  *AskIndia*   *Governance*  what do this flairs even mean? 

And how am I suppose to make a self post on a meme in NP category? Defeats the purpose of Memes doesn't it? Thought this place would be more open and free. Definitely need a Political sub and also rules 'only where needed'.  [deleted] >Remove low-effort political self-posts.

Who is going to decide this ?
As it is, there is already too much censorship in a so called platform for free speech. Request:Can politics/religion related posts (I put those two because they are closely linked) be moved to /r/IndiaPolitics or /r/IndianPolitics or whatever that sub is? Would be nice to have more music related posts. Especially folk music from different parts of the country. Please ban twitter and facebook from unverified accounts altogether. Even the ""screenshot+blur"" thing is ridiculous. Self posts with an actual argument that quotes statements from known but unverified officials (i.e. legit public figures who don't have the mark of verification) should be allowed. >Political discussions should be strictly [R] enforced.

And yet you have trolls calling the PM a faggot. How about a [Health] or [Medicine] flair as well? Indians can do with some evidence based medicine. > No direct submission to images (including memes) and Twitter.   

I agree with twitter restriction and most of twitter posts are again self-posts without any explanation behind them^Swamy. But, memes keeps the sub interesting. Some of the memes are shit, but I have seen some amusing ones that are randian's creativity.   


> Remove low-effort political self-posts.

They are willing to pay me $1000-$2000 for a month of initial work. There's also a possibility of getting more work if they get seed funding.

Should I file ITR-4 in 2018? 

Or can I just mention it as ""income from other sources"" under ITR-1?

They are also willing to offer me some equity. Don't know how international equity compliance works, so if any of you have any experience, that would be helpful.

I am sure there are plenty of you folks here who have faced a similar situation. I google a lot (my google-foo isn't that good), and posted in some CA forum, but no reply.

AskIndia,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,164,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica ‚Äî all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",2017-04-22 17:49:09

This video does an amazing job of explaining the problem with fpps. 

There are several alternatives to it, some are linked in that video itself.

Fpps is considered to be one of the worst system of elections and you can trace many of our problems to it. 

Edit: some of the alternatives are alternate vote and single transferable vote.  Fpps is the system in which the candidate with the most number of votes wins, regardless of the number of votes. 
For eg, there are 9 candidates in an election. One gets 12% and each of the others get 11%. The one with 12%will win the election since he has the highest number of votes despite his share being very low. 

This was the system followed in Britain at the time of Indian independence. That and the simplicity of the system led the makers of the Constitution to adopt it.

If that will be the frequency of new posts there, people will forget it very quickly.

Ninja edit: cant wait for the two nsfw subreddits ;) [removed] Hmm. I don't think this is required or a useful idea. It is a wastage of real estate on the front page. Thank you mods. I was also thinking of something in similar lines. 

Don't you guys think, Sub-reddit of a day is kind of too short a duration. Can you guys make it Sub of week/month, and link it to top bar after you guys decide to un-sticky it? I think we should limit fragmenting into subreddits. Waste of space.  Urgh its basically /r/xpostsfromAskReddit ! I think 24 hours is not enough. It should be more than that. maybe one week. Mods, you guys can use the following css hack to promote /r/askindia even more. You can have transparent Image background which can kindly let people know that they can ask their questions in /r/askindia.

I first posted this in /r/AskIndia but was advised to repost in /r/India. I am an expat and have been living in India for the last eight months. We are going back to the UK and need to ship some stuff home - the speed is not an issue but we need a good price.

We have about 20-30kg of stuff to ship to the UK. India post has quoted us 4k rupees for 10kg, which seems very very expensive.

We have checked the internet but everything seems equally expensive. Does anyone know if there is a cheap reliable way to ship things to the UK by surface mail? (From Delhi or Udaipur)
",duncanstibs," Did you check with DHL or FedEx? 
 


Edit :

But my guess is that India post might turn out cheaper  It is expensive, someone sent a book from UK and the shipping costed about 1000 or maybe more. It was those big self help hobby type books. But yeah, 20 kgs is going to cost you a lot. :( if it's only 20-30 Kg why can't you take it along with you? pay extra for the baggage.

Would Grad Schools in the US(I have no clue about how it works in Germany,Would Love if someone could shed some light on it too!) accept Msc degree holders from India?
PS:X-Post from r/AskIndia",VIKing10," They do accept , provided you have an excellent academic record along with other things to show , like research papers , RA etc. The acceptance rates are very low though.

If you consider swiss uni. like ETHZ , they also ask for course material you referred so that you meet the academic standards/background they expect. I assume it's something similar in Germany. US universities generally accept any 4 year course if you want to apply for MS/MS+Phd. They look at your academic record and GRE scores.

Getting into top-end universities is extremely hard though and there is a lot of competition from all over the world. If you want full scholarship (this is usually given to MS+PhD students) the competition is just insane for places like MIT/Stanford.

I'm not 100% sure about Germany but the UK accepts Indian 3 year undergraduate programs (except medicine, you need to sit for PLAB). I'd imagine germany is similar to UK. I just saw this on my FB feed about PhD in Germany. Check if you find anything useful. DAAD, a student exchange programme between India and Germany, hosts many webinars and expos.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Help me deal with an asshole tenant,79,cq5tzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cq5tzw/askindia_help_me_deal_with_an_asshole_tenant/,27,"Background: I rented my house to friend's acquaintance after a referral; he was a decent working guy with two kids. Since I repainted the house a week before and he needed a house for just a year; I did not put clause to painting cost of the house in the agreement, how much damage you could make in an year right!?

Fast forward to one year: **The agreement ended in the Feb 2019**, he stayed in the house until end of the May 2019, **without paying rent for three months**

And his kids thrashed the house completely. There was crayons scribbles everywhere, mud everywhere, even adults drew rangoli on the wall!

Now: I told him, I will deduct unpaid rent, the cost of painting, and to fix broken things from the security deposit. The guy is acting like complete asshole, locking the front gate and not returning the keys to the house, until I repay the security deposit in full!

I am replacing the locks to the house, consult the lawyer.



What are my other options? I don't really care about the money at this point, all want is the guy to pay for the damages.

Edit: added missing details

Edit 2: here's few pictures https://imgur.com/a/H6BPXLC",prashantvc," Never let a tenant stay even a minute beyond the lease date. No matter how well you know the person. This puts you and your property at immense risk incase things turn sour.


Security deposit is kept exactly for these situations- damage to the property. Furthermore, the rent for the time he has been living should be adjusted from the security deposit. You need to involve a paper trail ASAP. 


Involve the police and send him a legal notice if need be. First priority should be to get him out of the house. Police should help out here. But vamilies don't trash rented places. Only vaachalars do.

Hope you have taken pictures of the damages. Discriminate against bachelors more. ""Decent guy with 2 kids"" lol I hope you're not in Bengal cause the West Bengal Tenency Act leaves you no room to manoeuvre . Best i suggest is either cut off electricity/water/supplies or go to the local thana. They'll make a call and that sorts out most issues. Or tell any police friends you might have to call and threaten them on your behalf. He doesn't really have any standing . Do not get dragged into court no matter what!!!

Good luck Not an expert on this, but just get a cop in there? [removed] I think the interest on the security deposit alone would be enough to make up for the lost rent :) He cannot legally lock you out. Lawyer up.

Porn ban did affect her in the past, but not anymore. I had the pavlovian reaction of getting a erection whenever I looked at the VPN app on the homepage so I had to remove it. I‚Äôve always used torrent to download premium porn i.e Brazzers, NA, BangBros, etc etc 

So i don‚Äôt care. 

Never was a fan of tube porn. Yes. It helps my r/NoFap journey. Most of the comments didn't mention Torr browser which I feel is much easier and free.

Is there any con with the browser? No way My Broadband provider didn't banned any porn. In case of Mobile data, i don't visit mainstream sites which are banned by mobile service provider, so for me nothing affected. To visit any blocked site i use Puffin Browser which always opens blocked sites. like i advised last time someone posted a huge thread , opera browser has free VPN. Use that browser and enjoy your porn without any restriction. The locations are Us eu sea regions. At home , i have a local ISP so nothing's banned but on Airtel I use opera browser, the speeds are okayish and it's convenient. All the porn ban has done is made me use a VPN. I use my imagination more. Haven't affected me much cause I haven't been watching it often the last couple of years. I'm just over thirty and have watched it somewhat at least once a month since I was 13. I've always been religious though. So I've always tried not to do it. Did NoFap for some years and something clicked two years ago. I mean I still end up watching porn once every three or four months but it's not terribly exciting. It has to be said, it's super annoying when I watch it but don't get a big hit of dopamine like did when I was a teen. In the end I'm like, 'All this sinning for *this*?' lol. So yeah, I haven't felt the impact of the ban. There were a few times I tried to access the sites and saw that it was banned. I just shrugged and moved on.

Can I answer? 

...yeah, she's the only one. Nevermind. You need a serious tag here First I'll say it obligatory that I'm not attractive.
People keep staring at me wanting to engage or strike a conversation. but I'm an introvert and like to keep to myself. Not to be immodest or self gratuitous but its kinda weird that people stare at you in envy or maybe thats just me. Ok so not great looking and stuff, but I did become significantly better looking after losing weight. I'm told I'm ""cute"". It was a world of a difference with regards to my confidence and peoples perspective of me.

People treat me nicer when I'm thinner. I've been on dates with some very pretty girls and all round excellent human beings with interesting backgrounds (models, actresses, chefs, entrepreneurs etc.) Being more attractive than my past self has gotten me more attention and positive interest for the most part. People are also less harsh with their first impression of you. I'm not that good looking that people envy me, so yeah there's that. My friend is great looking.

So he gets a lot of female attention in general ( nature , you know )

He was in 2 or 3 platonic relationship ( wow ) 

Lots of crushes

Gets his work done ( from his admirers of course )

But still he is down to earth and humble. People just stare continuously, it's very very annoying, but I just learnt to ignore and pretend as if nothing's happening.

I feel bad for girls, They have it much much worse. Physical looks of a man don't matter much if it's not matched by confidence and certain badness. It's a mixed bag, you get better treatment from women in general and you end up having a few crazy girls with crushes on you etc. And some guys will absolutely hate you because you will make them feel insecure about their looks.

Here are the things I've heard gym trainers say in a couple of cities in India (translated).

""You won't gain weight now. It's summer, you will sweat too much to gain weight.""

""You don't need to do warm-ups dude. Just lift."" (This guy came three weeks later with his shoulder in a sling. Kya hua? Dislocate ho gaya)

""You *have* to do 15 reps, everything else is wrong. 3 sets of 6? How will the muscle get stimulated?""

""Compound exercises are for 'fitness'. Isolation exercises are for muscle building.""

""Optimum Nutrition? *ON*?? Koi local brand hoga..""

""Don't listen to doctors. Doctors themselves come to my gym."" (said by the same guy who said don't warm up).

**EDIT**: BONUS:
""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

EDIT2: Yes, The Bonus actually isn't bad. There's an argument for it. But I'll leave it here, as a testament to my own fallibility. And because ""phaavda leke.. "" sounds badass.",MauryanEmperor," I've trained for 5.5 years in NCR, hopping gyms every 6-12 months. I've been to some cheap gyms (INR 800/month) and been to some relatively expensive chains (bomiso, anytime fitness) and one thing is pretty common - the trainers all suck.   


In fact, in my experience, the most knowledgeable gym trainer I've met was at the cheapest gym - he owned the gym, and was running it in the basement of an actual residence.   


Here's how I've learnt to deal with the pseudo-trainers:   
1. Make them know their place: They're there to help you *if and only if you ask for help.* You've paid for the membership, which means you can use the equipment. You're under no obligation to listen to 'trainers'.   
2. Be courteous, but distant with them. Say ""I have my routine, I'm doing this."" Many trainers will just leave you alone, thinking you already have another plan, or know more than them (which is actually very probable)  
3. Follow your routine to a T, so you can impress the same guys with your results, in silence.   


Best of luck! I've been going gym since 2008 and have trained quite a lot of people for free, I can confirm that majority of trainers don't even know the names and proper form of exercise. Let alone talking about compound and isolation exercises. Gyms don't have a degree requirement so every gym bro or even a newbie can apply to become a trainer and then keep fucking up everyone else body. That's just exercise. Most of the people don't even know about nutrition and stuff. They will just point you to the nearest supplement counter. The deadlift one is actually correct. It's called a mixed grip, it improves stability and prevents the barbell from slipping. You need to alternate your underhand and overhand when using mixed grip so that you don't develop muscle imbalance. ""It's damn hot, can you turn on the AC?""  

""It's good if it's hot, you'll sweat more so become thinner.""  

WTF.png I got lucky when I started going to gym where there was a trainer in his 40s who knew almost everything there is about fitness that was in 2010. And now in Bangalore these trainers literally doesn't even know to teach pushups in correct form. Be careful when you choose to join a gym. Any should or knee joint issues will affect you throughout your life. Dude ,I have been lifting for 3 years and have even helped my friends in transformation,till now I have not seen a single trainer or even a competitor who knows his shit. I have even trained with Mr.UP and he doesn't know shit about training. These people are complete jackass . Most of these guys use PEDs told to them by some trainer and then suffer. You can check tarun Gill's channel on YouTube and not even 1 competitor knew his shit,1 of them was telling to stop bathing before competition. [deleted] I've been to 3 gyms in Bangalore including cult fitness and yes the trainers don't know shit. I would have got tendinitis if I continues with the cult fitness class. To be honest most of our workforce except the creamy layer need to be trained and retrained. This is the pain which comes with a growing nation. For instance, try looking for a handyman who is competent. It's really hard, or they are already working for a big company. The money they get from the jobs is also not so high so they don't put their heart and soul into this so they can make things better. Hopefully with growth of economy our country's workforce skills also grow up I used to go to a gym for a while (2014-15) and one of the trainers straight up told me to take some steroids cause I'm too skinny. Optimum nutrition



üòÇüòÇ True that. 

A lot of trainers focus on unnecessary things or sound phony asf. 

From what I've seen, Cult seems to carry some good trainers with good certifications.

Most of all, all the trainers that I've visited or seen are self made, they built a good body and then became a trainer because of the money. 
So they don't exactly know the scientific way but the way that worked for them. 

Either way, I see most Indians go through a lot of YouTube channels and blogs and pick what suits them best. 

My buffy buddies are all from the same method. I have gone to some form of gym for the past 4-5 years. For 2 years, when I went to the normal gym, I was doing squats wrong and no one told me about this (I dont know if it is because they didnt know or because of not giving a fuck since they are underpaid).  And many of them focus on isolation exercises and not compound or functional exercises which is a huge problem. 

I went to a functional fitness (not crossfit but similar) gym 3 years ago and that is where I came to know about Squats, Deadlift etc. But here too, the main trainer knows his stuff well while others do not. 

These trainers are also trying to sell either protein powder or dietician none of which I wanted. This is because they are earning about 15-25k per month (which is quite less for the amount of hours they put in tbh). These trainers make their money from personal training and hence maybe the lack of interest that you see around. 

Another important thing that all gyms across the country lack is their ignorance of cooldown. Most gyms do not focus on cooldown while those that do, do not spend more than 10 mins. I learnt it the hard way by going to the physiotherapist and spending 5k for rehabilitation. 

Currently, I go to the gym in my building itself. the trainer there is good, but doesnt know enough compound exercises. 

IMO, if you are looking at only fitness and have no huge goals, you can workout at home itself because there are a lot of online channels posting workout videos. All you need is a pair of dumbells  and a mat. Have been lifting for over 6 years, this should come as no surprise to you, there‚Äôs no regulation. 

Unfortunately you‚Äôre going to have to do your own homework on the internet and use your head to navigate the bro-science. 

While I lived in bombay I used to go to Nitrro, the membership was quite steep but the trainers knew their stuff there. But for the most part elsewhere, for sure, clueless. Certified trainers anywhere in the world will cost a fortune!

I have been working out for a long time without a trainer, using my own routine and have had fairly good results.

I recommend sites such as scoobys workshop (funny name but totally worth it) and the forums of bodybuilding dot com. The thing to keep in mind is that it takes time to build muscle and get sustainable results. There is no quick solution and any person giving quick results is either a liar or will end up hurting you. Yes. As with all fields in India which are technical.

If any of you want to learn to lift or whatever, just go to [https://startingstrength.com/](https://startingstrength.com/) Welcome bro. I use Jim wendlers routine which you can find online or buy his book. And use my trainer mostly as a spotter so that I don‚Äôt go bad form and break my back. I think that‚Äôs the best way to use Indian trainers and yes creating a routine and dieting wise they all suck according to me. This really depends on the franchise gym you go to. 

&#x200B;

Background : I used to go to Gold's gym in Chennai (think it was the first branch they opened in the country) and the trainers were all top notch. Even in Maverick's (FLUX now, I think) the trainers knew what they were talking about, and a good proportion of them were looking to get further certifications in the fitness industry. 

&#x200B;

I suppose it's a pretty banal case of you get what you pay for. The fitness industry, like a host of other industries, that have arrived in India needs some time to mature I suppose. The bonus isn't that bad. Pros usually deadlift with a mixed grip, it prevents the bar from slipping too much when compared to a double overhand grip. That's because when the bar starts to roll out of one hand, it rolls **into** the other.

Here are things the trainer at my gym said (I don't pay him, he's the owner too):

1. Heavy weights build size and no strength.
2. Do light weights with 25+ reps for fat loss.
3. Lat exercises reduce love handles
4. Side bends reduce love handles

People I know have had it worse than me. Their trainer made them do all machine workouts the first day, and full body workout every day for a month or so. And they went to posh gyms!

So yes, Indian trainers are pretty bad. Mainly because we don't have the level of education here which is possessed, or required to be possessed, by someone of that nature. Most here follow broscience of ""shock the muscle"". The trainer at my gym doesn't even know what Starting Strength and 5/3/1 are! Warming up has a lot of different connotations.

Warming up with lighter weights to practice form before the lifts? That's good.

Warming up by running on the treadmill for 10 minutes then practicing judo kicks for the next 10 before you actually pick up weights? Not productive. How to detect a bad trainer : Ask his opinion on leg curls and upright rows. If he approves of either of these, he's a bad trainer. Depends

I have been going to Gold Gym for last 4 years, and the one I train under is great

But it sucks for the wallet The body shape of most gym trainers in India says everything it has to about untrained gym trainers in India. Gym trainers in India are basically people who have spent a shit load of time in or around gyms I have seen quite a few trainers who don't know much but have somehow built a good physique, but there are also others I have met who REALLY know their shit as well as the science behind building muscles, something like the Athlean X guy. I'm never gonna forget the way one of them described chest exercises to me, the way they're supposed to be done...what people do wrong etc. Unfortunately that person rarely offers personal training and owns the gym lol Does anyone here know how good the cult.fit classes are? Especially the boxing classes? > Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

I have seen guys do that. what's the logic of doing that? I have foudn vice versa also, many people are not even willing to listen to sound advice, since sound advice requires working on form and technique. People in my gym do half squats without wanting to put in effort to master below parallel depth. Some do close grip bench with very close grip, fuck wrists. Lift arms all the up top in dumbbell rows. And despite my reasoning (some of these are friends), most just stay on, since they can lift heavier weights this way with poor form. People however flock to model/trainer in my gym who looks better than me :/. I dont know where you live but i live in vasai and in my local gym there are certified trainers. I have been training for more than 7 years . Most of the trainers  who are certified are always looking for clients because they earn more throught clients than spending more amount of time being employed inthe gym. My advice is do your research. If you are willing to invest time and money in the gym you should invest some time in picking up a routine and progressively overload. Most trainers suck. They offer diet advice even when they know they are not supposed to. They don't understand that rep range depends upon fitness and advice 15 reps to everyone.the good thing is I've met some good trainers. They don't try to force their methods on everyone. I lucked out way back in the day and ended up with a high level powerlifter as a trainer. He was into heavy lifts, low reps and a LOT of rest in between sets. 

I lucked out in joining the gym. It was cheap, great equipment, empty most of the time so the trainer had nothing else to do but chat with me and give fitness tips. Wow, a lot going on here. I have been trying to get fit and get regular at a gym but I don't know what should I do. I am not experienced with the equipment and gym instructors only help out in the initial few days of joining a gym. Any ideas where I can learn the movements and how to do them safely, I'd like to avoid injury at all costs.  I have tried watching tutorials on youtube but it there is too much noise there to make senseful plan. Gymming veterans please help guide me. > BONUS: ""Deadlifts? One palm grips front, one grips reverse. Haan, jaise phaavda leke gaddha khodne waale ho"".

This one is correct advice, but you don't need to do this for lower weights. As you stack more weights, the chance of slipping goes up. Also, when you lift the plates can spin a little because both your wrists are facing the same direction. The momentum can be enough to cause the barbell to spin out from your hand. 

TBH, i've seen lot of bro-sciency stuff even in the west. Trainers who keep updating their knowledge are the best ones. Ones who haven't will tell you it's ok to do lat pull downs behind your neck like they used to 20 years ago. Anytime fitness here pays general trainers like 10k for 8 hours shifts. A good occasionally competing trainer eats 30-40k  a month.  Senior trainers are also some 3-6 months certified ones with 2-3 years of lifting experience.

&#x200B;

But this thing is fading with the ecoms and these new Indian youtubers like Jeet Salal, Gaurav Taneja, Mybollywood Body, Guru mann, Sangram Chougule, Sahil Khan etc. So these trainers nowadays are mainly just for spotting weights or running an illegal steroid cycle. What gyms have you heard these from? Supporter nhi phnega toh ""chhota"" ho jayega "" paani bhar jayega"" I have learned the proper forms, techniques and workouts from YouTube. Yup they are. They also practice the worst bro science and will just take juice to get their body. 

If you wanna join a fitness and health discord server to discuss gym, supplements, diet share your progress etc.. 

https://discord.gg/uCgERhW [deleted] Ur right. Thats the case with 90 percent of the trainers. These guys are filled with bro science and have at some point in their life and/or currently taken steroids, to get their body where it is now. 

These idiots also peddle steroids / growth hormones / growth hormone releasing peptides to young naive gym goers to help reach the ideal 'instagrammable' physique. 


Off late these dumb fuck trainers have discovered muscle building content on youtube via fake natties and sellouts, further fuelled with social media and popular forums and are again peddling misinformation and bad plans to people.  There seems to be no end to this chutiyapa. 

People need to have thier eyes opened to the right information. Yes [deleted] [deleted] Darebee.com for routines and freeweight exercises This is very true One guy who used to train in our gym for a few years off and on has now become a trainer for a reputed gym brand (I won't say the name as I don't want him to get in trouble). Apart from the fact that he weighs barely more than a feather, we know that he doesn't know a thing about exercises, let alone nutrition and stuff. So, yeah, that's bound to happen. Also, most of them force you to increase the weight, without asking you to do so progressively, infact they don't even care about form, which is really important Ratio of gym patrons with fit bodies to unfit bodies is surprisingly high at my gym. I'd think the trainers do a good job here. Why would you call yourself a bad trainer? I started training in 2014 and have been training for the better part of last 5 years in Hyderabad. I have been to multiple gyms from cheap to the expensive ones(Core fitness). In my experience most of the gym trainers that i have met and conversed with don't know anything about training and bodybuilding. Most of trainers that i have encountered are just a bunch of guys who trained for a few years using PED's and steroids being completely clueless about basics of training, supplementation and  nutrition. Infact, most of them are just there to sell you products like protein powders, BCAA's, Creatine and that too fake ones. Even most of the youtubers present in Indian bodybuilding community like Rohit Khatri, Tarun Gill etc do not provide science based empirical studies and evidence behind their exercises and videos and is just bro science. I personally find youtubers like Seth Feroce([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkZuCxXdE6OUGDEbETcjhPw)) and  Jeff Nipard([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/icecream4PRs))  the best in the industry when it comes to sharing knowledge relating to supplements, exercises, importance of warmups, gear amongst other things. I have learnt the most from their youtube channels amongst all the youtubers that i used to follow.

A few of my personal favourite Seth's videos :

Steroids - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVP\_h2nqnMQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVP_h2nqnMQ) Damm,I have been working out since 2016 and all the knowledge I have is from the internet cause the trainer's I have met don't know shit. It's good to see educated gym goers like you guys who actually give a shit about things like form, compound movements,proper warmup etc. I hope I can meet some of you in real life someday and share the love for working out. A beginner 17M here with 95Kg weight. Anybody can help suggest me something? Guys , I agree with mostly all of you. But koi mujhe yeh batao ki original supplements aur Sahi rates Mai kaha milenge? Flipkart aur Amazon pe Mai chutiya katwa chuka hu. On a completely different note, have you tried training with kettlebells? The stuff will turn you into a beast. I'm never going back to isolation workouts. You're not alone with this kind of experience This is an example of a job that can pay better in India than outside of India. 

I knew an American who made excellent money gym training in Mumbai, better than he would have back in the US. Tl;Dr version of my answer is yes. My trainer is completely aversive to suggest supplements but gives some bs advices at times. The most ridiculous being his diet charts. Follow the r/fitness wiki and the website exrx.net As someone who is deciding to make a career in fitness (starting as personal trainer), Which institute do you guys suggest?  

So far I've heard of K11, ACE, ACSM, IFSI, Gold's. I've failed 12th std, so can't do ACE or ACSM, their sites say that 12th is required as qualification.  

Any certified trainers here, that can guide me? I once saw a guy doing bent over rows on smith machine. No shit Sherlock",2019-06-07 22:43:30

AskIndia,AskIndia: Did anyone experienced hair fall after moving to new place?,27,ca7vfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ca7vfz/askindia_did_anyone_experienced_hair_fall_after/,31,"Did you experience hair fall after moving to new place? How did you fix that problem? Is it because of water, weather or something else?

How long it will took to become completely bald or visibly bald?",meinBhiEngineer," It's testosterone mate. You've got too much. Ever seen some unfortunate old person begging on the street, his head full of hair? Do you think it's the water he uses? 

Water and environment might have some passing effect, but if it's in your genes, consider yourself fucked out of a full lush head of hair. 

Makes me cry everytime. Bangalore can make you go bald due to the ground water that some parts of the city uses. Check for water quality. Hard water does that. Check water quality. Hard water can make your hair brittle There are so many reasons for balding:

Genetic

Hormonal

Hard water

Autoimmune 

Last but the best, EVOLUTION (You don't need them to survive so if you're balding and all the other causes are ruled out then consider yourself to be on the forefront of evolution). It's an advantage. Avoid stress, keep your scalp always clean- no dandruff and shit. This worked for me. So, after moving to Bangalore, my hair started turning grey. Moved back home and the grey is almost gone now. Genetics are the main reason for early balding. Your maternal grandfather's hair is a generally a good indicator for your hair health. If he faced balding problems early in his life, there is a good chance of you facing them too.
Stress, diet, haircare and exercise definitely help but if your genetics are the cause of your balding, you're going to face a tough time dealing with it. 
Consult a trichologist who'll give you better insights about it. All I can say mate is go buzz. It's due to genes. But still there may be chances that it's temporary. So don't stress, no gel, no wax and go buzz. See the result overtime. And more advice is stop \*cough\*... \*cough\* fapping for sometime(may not be necessary).",2019-07-08 04:43:53
AskIndia,[AskIndia][Serious] Is it worth attempting immigration to Canada/ Australia for 1.6lpm-ers in India?,55,c4ilk5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c4ilk5/askindiaserious_is_it_worth_attempting/,115,"Title. 

From what I understand based on armchair research: 
Motivation to immigrate: better future life for children in terms of clean water, air, education
Cons (probable): not the same standard of living as is currently?, slower professional growth, racism? 

Experienced immigrants/ those who are in similar shoes, please share your thoughts",aashish2137," NRI with a fairly neutral opinion here.

Some Cons that aren't always shared:
Expect a much quieter social life, a cultural gap in addition to a generational gap with your children, a reduced sense of self-identity, a lower standard of living and immense adjustment stress. 

Ofcourse you'll have more money after immigrating but it won't feel as luxurious as it sounds when one multiples dollars into rupees. If you enjoy a more self-involved lifestyle, it'll be easier to adjust. If you'd like, I'd be happy to chat over dm and answer more specific questions. I my opinion if you are looking for material happiness then immigrating is not a bad idea. What I mean by that? With just two months of salary in Canada you can actually afford a nice 60 inch LED TV, a sound bar and a nice couch. One year into job you can afford a muscle car like Camaro or Mustang (with loan ofcourse). You can also meet Indians and make new Indian friends by going to temples or other Indian group meeting that you look up on Facebook. 

But if you are a kind of guy who likes to be around family and friends, don't really care what car you are driving and the kind of house you are staying in then Canada might be boring. All in all I would say getting Luxury is easier in Canada/Australia than in India. But getting Family and friends is easier in India. And as someone already mentioned if you have Kids then the equation is entirely different. I migrated to Canada in 2017 - it's been a great experience for me so far, but it boils down to effort, luck and circumstances. 

My standard of life by local comparisons is definitely lower than my peers - a dollar goes a lot less than a rupee would in India. Having said that, though - I've never been a particularly money obsessed person. Give me a cot, 3 square meals and a roof over my head and I'm good, but I do appreciate that the quality of stuff I get here is substantially better for the amount I pay for it compared to India. 

Professional growth - I'd argue it's the opposite due to my specific circumstances. Employers let you Work from Home, some others (like mine) have an 'education allowance' to allow you to upskill on the company's dime, I get plenty of days off (5 day work week, statutory holidays means no work - it's actually straight up criminal and I get Christmas week (till New Year's off). Nobody questions/interrogates you if you want to take a few days off. I actually changed my role within the company because my own manager said I'd be a right fit for it and he helped me get the job. I love my coworkers and we get along very well. 

Racism - Can't speak for Australia but in Canada, it's mostly been low-key and barely noticeable if not non-existent (largely owing to the significant number of Indians already in Canada), outside of some clearly mentally ill people (the city of Toronto does a shitty job of looking after the mentally ill homeless people, especially now that it's summer and they're all around the city). 

I've already accepted the fact that neither side will truly accept me for what I am (Third Culture Kid, so not really fully Indian and not really super westernized, either) so the idea of a generational gap is already a forgone conclusion. 

Happy to answer any questions if folks are interested in learning more about the process or are generally just weighing options and want to know more about life in Canada - I also happen to run a landing group for new immigrants basically to help them with a social support structure as they get their sea legs after they land. It could be. 

You need to identify what pay in Canada/Australia is equivalent to the 1.6 lpm.  Then identify jobs that pay that in respective countries and then identify cities that would make your chances of achieving that better. 

For factors such as free/subsidized medical, education and to some extent a higher standard of living (to each his own). It is definitely worth doing it. 

Happy to answer in private too. Especially about Australia. Or even New Zealand. So this might be a one off case but even younger Indian who are in their 20s or 30s can experience a massive culture shock.

Eg 1 : My friend and his two kids stayed in Boston. So Indians are known as a race who hits their kid to discipline them (also  known as child abuse ). So his kid's friends and teachers had taught the kid that they can call the police if their parents hit them. 

His kids were the worst pieces of unruly shit I have ever laid my eyes upon. He and his wife literally went mad trying to discipline them. The kids used to threaten to call the police or complain to teacher if they hit them. So the parents were quite shocked and unable to control their kids. They eventually moved back to India.

Eg 2: if you are a conservative Indian, be prepared for your kids teenage years. They will date other people, probably indulge in casual sex, have secret alcohol parties. Dress skimpily and post tons of those pics on fb, Instagram etc. This is just pretty much inevitable and pretty common in the west. 

I have a modern friend who is well travelled, well read, rich and comfortable but just can't sleep because his teenage daughter was dating someone and loved partying and dancing. They can compromise on many things but kid's possible promiscuity is something they can't adjust to. 

This was few observations from a a decade ago or so. Depends on your line of work too, I guess. A 1.6 LPM friend of mine moved to Canada for MBA (he was in IT here before that) and struggled to find a job in business/management. So switched to IT after doing his MBA since he saw better job prospects here. Within Canada there are a lot of variations as well. Vancouver and Toronto metro areas are expensive and you will definitely have to sacrifice on some of your comforts. Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Winnipeg and Halifax are far more affordable. Halifax is a booming city now with a growing tech industry and pretty affordable. Canada isn‚Äôt as high paying as the US. But it‚Äôs offset by free healthcare, education & the environment there. It‚Äôs a massive pain to adjust to any new country. 

Even if you find a job that pays 100k CAD a year, the adjustments you need to make in terms of social settings will stay the same. 

But, depending on where in Canada you are for example GTA - you‚Äôll find a robust Indian community. Canadians are in general more welcoming of immigrants vs other countries in the current scenario. 

Australia is just way too racist for my personal taste. They‚Äôve a very rigid set of thinking & have an intellectual superiority complex in the work place & there is a Trump like PM in Australia now. Absolutely. I was a 1.6lpm before leaving. This was 2 years ago. It was totally worth it. I'd do it knowing what I know now. [deleted] [deleted] Yes, it is.",2019-06-24 18:41:18

Bajra roti

Lentils

Methi 

Palak 

Loki 

Cucumber 

Bitter gourd

Banana 

Watermelon 
 

All in moderation is healthy The brits have a saying about 5 a day, which is 5 fruit and veg in a day. I try to keep that up with cheap ingredients.

Lentils are cheap and a good source of fibre and protein. So dal with rice, then whatever cheap seasonal veggies I can get my hands on. Bottle gourd, spinach, cauliflour etc. I make a batch of poriyal with each one, then mix and match for a week. Different lentils so I don't feel like I'm having the same thing over and over.

Idli with sambar is cheap too. 

Eggs, in different ways. Like in fried rice with some veggues left after making a big batch of poriyal. Or egg curry with idli.

When buying chicken, I buy the whole thing. I use the legs for curry, breasts for something like chicken 65, leftover meat for salad. The bones make a good stock, which can be used with the eggs and leftover meat for Chinese sweet corn chicken soup.

The trick is to learn how to use every ingredient in many things, as well as how to repurpose leftovers in a different tasting dish. I used these dishes when I was in India, and now that I live in a very expensive country, I use them even more. I just replace Indian veggies with the local cheap ones like broccoli and zucchini. Sattu ka sherbet Oats for breakfast- there's deal on Amazon every two weeks or from dmart add few Slices fruits and milk. Eggs, peanuts, spinach. Chicken.

Edit: soy beans basic food stuff is already pretty cheap in india, not sure how much cheaper you can get. Daal, roti, eggs, in season veggies and fruits, chicken breast(debatable if it's cheap but from a protein/cost ratio it's one of the better deals out there), dahi etc. Basically Ghar ka khaana but with a little more emphasis on protein and veggies rather than the carbs and snacking on fruits, dahi, nuts(expensive yes but alternatives like pumpkin seeds etc exist). We're lucky we get fresh food at a very reasonable rate and we have the eat cheap and healthy sorted out for us Idli **If you cooking at home:**

* Boiled Eggs 5 INR Each 7P6F
* Chicken 30 Rs per meal 50P10F
* Paneer 45 Per meal 30P40F
* Chhole/Rajma/Soya/Peanuts/Other Lentils= \~100 INR per Kg
* Ghee 400/KG
* Rice and Potato/Sweet Potato/Banana for carbs.
* Cucumbers, Spinach, Carrot,  Cauliflower, Cabbage, Tomato, Onion for basic Salad and unlimited seasonal veggies.

**Healthy, Cheaper, Transparent and Cleaner options i prefer when eating out:**

* Chicken/Paneer Tandoori/Tikka 100-200 INR for 300-400g
* Rajma/Chole Chawal
* Chicken/Mutton Biryanis
* Plain Milk, Curd. Oatmeal is relatively cheap here, easy to make and eat. Wheat roti and Gujrati dal. It's light and really filling. Eggs, rajma chili, roasted sweet potato , brown rice pulao , sprouts salad, sauted green veggies, nuts, upma, etc. Its not difficult once you learn what produce you can actually use, it just comes down to trial and error for what works for you. We Indians tend to consume a lot of carbohydrates and fats and minimal proteins. Those who advocate lentil based diets tend to miss the point that the quality of the proteins isn't comparable to animal based proteins. Another important point is the fact that diets high on lentils and fiber have less protein available for absorption though calculated values may far exceed the reality at the level of the small intestine. A diet based on animal protein is your best bet for good growth. Plant based proteins that can replace animal protein based diets are still expensive and not widely available.

From an environmentally-conscious citizen's point of view, try finding e-waste collecting agencies in your city. For example- [https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/](https://yourstory.com/2017/11/waste-management-startups/) start up on this page. 

**My 2 cents** 

I had done a project on e-waste management in Delhi. The conclusion was that no one in India is recycling formally- the technology is too expensive and sending the waste to countries which have this waste recycling facility is not profitable. Hence, almost all of the waste that is collected by these so called ""formal sector"" collection and recycling firms ends up with informal e-waste recyclers which are found in and around Seelampur area in Delhi. 

You could easily give it to the mobile repair shops in your neighborhood who will repair the phone or take the useful parts to use in other mobiles. Thus you would have extended the life of the mobile.",2019-08-02 06:03:59

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What song is this ?,6,comakt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/comakt/askindia_what_song_is_this/,6,"Often when I think of home there is a particular Hindi pop a song plays in my head that was popular in the early 2003, the year I left home. I can recall only one line from the song and hum the tune of the same bit and nothing more. Over the years, I, for the life of me can't find the title of the track or singer. I've trawled through a several 2000s pop songs compilation on youtube, lyrics websites without much luck.

What I can remember: 

* **Genre**: Hindi pop song
* **Singer**: Male, lean and tall (at the time of filming)
* **Year**: 2003 or 2001 (A ""hit"" song during the month of CBSE board exam)
* **Lyrics**: (Not chorus) It goes by *kore kagaz ki tarah, adhoori (khali?) meri (hamari?) kahani hai* the next line is sung in the same tune. That is all I can recall. 
* **Music Video**: Filmed indoor with large open space, maybe just walls (dark) in an open field with no roof. Heavy wind blowing into the singer's face and all over the place (as you do). The singer wears sunglasses (totally unnecessary), dressed in black and he features in most of the video. He is stood in front of the car on occasions. The whole video has a dark blue hue and borderline black and white. 

That's all I can remember unfortunately. Frustratingly the song has been on the tip of my tongue for a fair few years and with every passing year it gets harder to bear the fact that I may die (not terminally ill) without ever being able to listen to this song once more. 

**TLDR**: Can't bear the fact I may never be able to find the song that reminds me of home and childhood memories.

In India if you are in a relationship, then you already are talking about marriage and how to convince your parents from day 1 of your relation. So there will hardly be any space or suspense to propose marriage. ""To hum rishtaa pakkaa samjhe?""


i.e. Shall we consider this (marriage) proposal confirmed? deti hai toh de warna gaand mara Guys can be creepy. They don't realize that they are being creepy, which is the pitiful and sad condition of India. Also, most healthy relationships root from friendship, so I don't get the concept of friendzone. Also, I have seen girls rejecting guys just for fun so they can be vicious.

I've also noticed lack of confidence in many guys. 

""What would you do if I proposed you?"", ""I love you""...on WhatsApp. I mean, am I supposed to take it seriously.

The best was when I received a plant with a note attached to it in person, because the guy noticed that I didn't like the fact how flowers just go to waste after gifting. It was something thoughtful and I really adored it. 

So yeah, it depends. (If you re planning to propose, it totally depends on person. I am not a fan of roses and all the cliche things but she/he might be. You need to know the person to actually like them, or is it just 'love at first sight'?)

I have been reading on many websites and trying to find out the processes, terminology and what not - just to be stuck in reading but not doing anything.

Randian's who have managed to and/or doing it on there own, please put in your experiences and guides to do the needful.

I'd like to stress here that though the process is considered simpler now, it seems far too bureaucratic  for a IT simpleton like me. From what I have read and understood:

* LLP or Private Limited are better than OPC (why?)
* LLP or PL need 3 people, while OPC needs one and one for nomination
* register company, get some secure USB token
* register trade marks (but no idea how to register different company names and products - like One97 and Paytm) for apt classes (35 to 45) or in all of them
* dedicated Office : needed or not?
* GST, VAT, etc :  what's needed and when?

And then there is freelancing and creating your own product - for which what and what not's are not clear anywhere. because presumably you'd need trademark and stuff there too and you also need TAN and PAN and DIN and current accounts and etc.

What I am interested in creating my web based product, and deploying it and making money. problem is I don't know if it is actually that simple.

So I don't want to make it about myself. I'd like this to be for others too who might want to seek up similar help or who'd step on this path in future.

Please, help and post your knowledge and experiences.

Thanks!!! üôè",cleanstart92," Pvt Ltd or LLP are indeed better than OPC, but if you're solo and don't want to involve anyone, it's better to go with OPC than a Proprietorship. In fact, unless you're taking outside investment or have more than one partner (i.e. yourself), I would even recommend to go for an OPC instead of a Pvt Ltd.

OPCs get treated like Pvt Ltds in all matters but don't have the same compliance burden. 

You're also overthinking this. Register a company (don't need dedicated office; just need address proof) first. Once that's done, talk to a CA about registering trademarks.

Also, this isn't shit you should be DIYing. Hire a CA. If you hope to be a founder, you'll have to delegate. Financial and compliance matters are not in your domain of expertise, so offload them to people who specialize in these things. Few of my inputs

1. **Don't incorporate a LLP or Company unless external reasons require you to do so.** They only add additional compliance expenses, closing them down is lengthy and expensive process and they provide no additional value. Forget what you read about limited liability you read online, this is India not USA.
2. **If you have to incorporate, create a LLP instead of OPC or Limited company.** Otherwise, if you end up making good money, it will be locked up in company account and a you can't withdraw without paying additional dividend tax. You can always convert a LLP to company if needed, but converting a company to LLP has lot of rules and waiting period.
3. **Hire a CA.** Don't do all legal stuff yourself.

&#x200B;

Finally, if you just want to make a web based product, do as proprietorship. Unless you start earning 5-10 lakhs a year, its useless to get involved in legal stuff.",2019-07-09 19:25:35

Hello all, right now I am working in manual testing ( basically game testing),I like programming but my logic is not that good, so I have decided to go for Automation testing.

Edit 1: for context - age 26F, BE computer science",seeseetwo," Yep. Manual testing is dead in most places.

Definitely practice coding and look for dev jobs as older (slower) companies still employ different teams for Dev and QA but the newer ones that practice DevOps don't. Not just manual testing, but QA/testing as a field is dying. We don't have separate devs/testers in most places nowadays.

Automation is actually a good step up if you want to get into programming. You can start from there and slowly build up. Meanwhile, you can keep preparing and practicing programming in your spare time. I can recommend a few online courses as well if you're really interested.

And hey, 'my logic is not strong' is not the way to go about this. Spend time, learn, and you'll do more than just fine. All the best. Automation is good field, but don't expect the testing to be a field that companies would be willing to spend on in the near future. Most of them are now hiring full stack engineers who should know to code end to end also are expected to test their own modules. Start working on your java skills, try python too it's easy to pick up if you already understand java. Get a bit onto coding daily, small programs and logic questions like in competitive programming should help you.

Also, Buy Dominar. Try Jawa. Waiting period is long though. I'll address all the recommendations in this thread with my opinion. I spent a lot of time researching bikes this year prior to my own purchase.

Duke 125/200 / MT15 - Do not have comfortable pillion seats. I had to throw them out of my head for that reason alone.

Dominar - Meets and maybe even exceeds expectation for the price, but is expensive.

FZ25 - A good machine overall, fits in your budget perfectly.

Apache RTR 200 - I own this. If your touring needs are that light, you'll find yourself more than satisfied. It's extremely fun (rev happy), has a comfortable pillion seat and a very satisfying power band. You'll save some money too.

FZv3/Hornet - They have significantly lower power numbers. The Hornet is also quite handsomely priced for what it is. They're not as *fun* to ride as the other motorcycles on this list, but are great for mileage and pillion comfort.

Get test rides and more importantly, **get dual channel ABS**. Have you considered the Dominar? Will require stretching your budget by 30k though. A tourer's dream.

But do test ride it regardless. And check if local service centers have good reviews. FZv3 or MT15 FZV3 or Honda Hornet. Exceeding the budget, could go for Dominar. Nothing apart from these three is even worth giving your time. Dominar, Apache 200 4v, Yamaha FZ 25, Gixxer, Gixxer SF Bajaj Avenger, do test ride it first.

Hello all, My sister got a 49,000 rank in JEE Mains with Delhi domicile. She has got MAE in IGDTU till Round 1, but hasn't been upgraded till Round 3. Our options below in order of choice filling - 

1) IGDTU - ECE Electronics - I was expecting her to get this till round 3 but haven't till now, so a bit worried

2) NSUT - MPAE Manufacturing Process & Automation Engg - Very difficult to get considering last year cutoffs - may get only after Round 4

3) DTU - MAM Mechanical & Automotive Engg - May not get - high cutoff

4) NSUT - BT Biotechnology - Not a lucrative branch, but I have preferred it over other slightly better or similar branches of DTU because of lesser number of students (= better chance of getting placed)

5) IGDTU - MAE Mechanical & Automation Engg - Allotted

6) DTU - PIE Production & Industrial Engg - All of below branches are almost alike in placement scenario as all of them have very less/poor Core placement options. Students from these branches either go for Software, other Non-core profiles, MBA or MS. 

7) DTU - Civil

8) DTU - EP Engg Physics

9) DTU - Polymer

10) DTU - ENE Environmental Engg

11) DTU - BT Biotechnology

Of late I have been thinking if we should prefer BT, Polymer from DTU (far better college than IG) over MAE (better branch than BT) from IGDTU. I myself am from an IIT but from Civil branch and couldn't get a placement from campus. So I would totally prefer a better branch in place of better college but MAE is not an exceptional branch either. And she won't get IT in IGDTU either.

Q2. Considering no. of students, should I keep NSUT BT above DTU branches?

Q3. I have read some post on quora stating that NSUT is better for circuit branches, and DTU is better for rest. How true is that? 

Q4. Is ECE at IGDTU good enough? (if she gets it in further rounds)

AskIndia,[AskIndia] How is your Jio Gigafiber connection,6,bysss1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bysss1/askindia_how_is_your_jio_gigafiber_connection/,23,"Boyyo, the shittiest connection on planet Earth and it hasn't even been 24 hours of me using it. Leaving all the privacy concerns aside and various technical concerns aside like IPv4 to IPv6 migration (that has been covered in detail in a post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aeblpo/r_please_dont_get_jio_gigafiber_and_i_have/?st=jwpse9tu&sh=4ffb9a21) ), I want to delve into the more mundane or trivial shitty things that come along with Jio Giga connection  

1) what the hell is with the landline, how could anyone be stupid enough to connect the landline with the router, fuck i have to keep the modem switched on a 24*7 or no landline connectivity. these fucktards ever heard of overheating  

2) of course the landline connection is itself a pain in the ass. fucking takes too long between consecutive rings, one might think it even got disconnected after the first ring  

3) the shitty shitty whyphy, motherfucker i want to kill the salesman who said i would be getting 50-60 mbps, the speed that i get is even lower than their low speed data that should be around 1 mbps, fucker reminds me of the gprs/edge days which still might be faster because of low data requirement for the page  

4) the stupidest and tardiest customer service ever, first you have to wait a whoopass 20 fucking minutes on the phone listening to the fucking jio tone or whatever, if that doesn't fry your brains, then the customer service guy/gal will. they are the fucking most typical indian customer service guys you can imagine. For a moment I thought i was in the south park episode with customer support and the vr headset. If you have seen Kenny's and kanan's maa ki dal sketch, then this guy is even worse than kenny. the same guy is the customer support and the floor manager and the technical team and yet they don't know shit  

enough with rant, i had some question for my borthers who got baited  

 * if any jio gigafiber users have figured a workaround for the landline, do tell mate  
 * how is your wi-fi speed, please tell me it gets better  
 * and yes any data hoarder or torrent user, does gigafiber have port forwarding, i have made all firewall exceptions, enabled upnp and still not able to open a port  

edit: i mentioned port forwarding in the last line incorrectly, i wanted to know about upnp support on jio, cause  with most CGNAT enabled isps, asking for static ip's becomes costly, so i had been using upnp to seed which can be easily enabled on the modem webpage. previously i had been using airtel and they had this service, what is the case with jio?",darkknight42062," We haven't got Jio Gigafiber yet in our city. 

How much do you for it and what's the plan? I'm currently using local broadband service that provides 20 Mbps speed for unlimited data at annual price of Rs 5500 and I'm pretty satisfied with it. Been using it for 1.5 years and still haven't faced any major issue with the service. For the first point , it‚Äôs triple play so everything is done through the ONT. so no use trying to bad mouth them for the unique experience 

Second jio uses CGNAT so no port forwarding at all.you‚Äôll need to buy static ip to do the same and no this is not unique .almost all Indian isps do the same . Rs 2500 ONT only has 2.4 GHz wifi so speed will be slow.",2019-06-10 16:44:44

Also, should I stick with the Windows 10 Home it came with or switch to Pro, or even Linux, probably?",barbiebear69," Windows 10 by default has a lot of unnecessary settings enabled. Turn them off, for example Cortana and Opt In Ads. Also uninstall extra software that ASUS installs by default (a quick Google search will help you see which ones are useful and which ones aren't). Update the PC fairly regularly and use windows defender to scan for malware once in 2 weeks. Download ublock origin, privacy badger and https everywhere from the firefox/chrome store, depending on the browser you use. 

Win 10 Home is fine. If you're getting pro for free might as well as get that since you're getting additional features (which you will most likely never use) for free, but if you have to pay then don't. Install TripMode (get it from TripMode.ch) - it's not free but cheap. Using TripMode you can easily control what programs are allowed to connect to the internet. This can be a huge blessing with Windows 10 that will keep trying to upload all your personal data to Microsoft and / or try to download huge updates. You can simply block all this and run windows update when you want to.

Don't install Chrome as it will just slow down your system - it's a personal data, memory and processor hog. Instead use Firefox or PaleMoon with uBlock Origin extension for blocking ads along with Privacy Badger and DecentralEyes extension.

Yes, install Linux. I recommend [LMDE (Linux Mint Debian Edition)](https://www.linuxmint.com/download_lmde.php) instead of Ubuntu which also slows down systems now a days. Use it the best way you can. Don't worry about OS until it bothers you to a point you need to consider alternatives. Only thing I'd suggest you do is monitor the battery life. Playing games, watching videos will drain your batter faster than, say, browsing reddit or editing text files. Once you settle into a routine, monitor how long your battery lasts. Keep it clean. Keep it updated. Expect to run some software, since you are in college. Don't have to worry about it rn. ~Security - Malwarebytes + Windows defender+ ublock adblocker+ Privacy Badger+maybe a pop-up blocker.

- Not enough evidence to prove the allegations. Verdict in favor of MJ Akbar, Priya may go to Jail.
- Allegations are true. Priya not guilty, though nothing happens to MJ.
- MJ withdraws the case. 

MJ only targeted Priya and left others who came out against him. With little to no evidence to prove the harassments happened years back, I'm curious on what grounds Priya can win this case or come out not guilty.",ronnieboy_7,,2019-07-18 06:01:57

While I expect most people to complain about merit or whatever. I'm wondering about people who can think past that. Yes, it will mean women will be set up as puppet candidates, but then men are set up as puppet candidates all the time. So we arent losing on anything.

What is this major problem? Equal opportunity doesn‚Äôt mean equal outcome. You can create reservations for women in politics but it doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that more women will be inclined to join politics. All you can do is create awareness and leave the choice to them. Why just stop there? Reserve 70-80% seats for backward castes because that's their true population proportion. I don't know how i feel about reservations in general. But if we do implement reservation then why not make it proportional to the actual ratio of men and women? Even if this happens, most seats will be won by women who will be the puppets of their husbands/family, aka Ravri Devi. There needs to be good governance set in place, the probability of an independent woman making it to the top is very less in India unless she's already having a career in politics, which most seats won't have. Let‚Äôs also reserve seats based on religion, caste, height, weight, skin tone and length of penis. /s",2019-06-17 19:33:00

But that's not all about it, it's still an interesting show even if you take out all the nudity. 

 I am currently watching Band Of Brothers. Can't take David Schwimmer seriously lol! 


Finished Netflix Kingdom yesterday! (Korean Zombie Series) it was awesome!  Just finished True Detective Season 3. Better than Season 2. Mob psycho 100 Avatar the Last Airbender. Surprisingly mature for a kids TV show The Office, US Version.

Currently on Season 6 Finished Sex Education, its actually a really good show  Watching in Delhi metro rides is not proper way of binging, you need do binge TV series 3 days before exam ,that is the only proper way Parks and Recreation! [deleted] Hannah Montana!!!

  


I am in my mid thirties and I am not ashamed to say this. I loved the show!

  


  


  


Miley is awesome! (The character in this show, not the actual Miley Cyrus)

She's so much fun, blunt, to the point, very expressive and animated, so cute!

  


And best part is, unlike other Disney Princesses, she is so much real; She keeps getting into trouble, tries to balance her double life, has her own little struggles, and doesn't get saved by a prince. ;-)

  


And she is also very clever, smart, funny, witty, and, best of all, silly.

  


Her dad and brother are quite nice characters. They are so relatable. I love their Tennessee accent. The dad makes dad jokes all the time. So dope.

  


It's her friend Lilly who annoys me. But she is Miley's friend. So our friend too!

  


But how will it be a Disney show if it doesn't take us to a fancy fantasy land!? This show doesn't fail us there either. She is just another teenage kid, who lives the life of superstar once she puts on the wig!!! Which teenager can't fantasy such a life!?

  


And like a fable, they convey some nice messages! Such as ""if you get down with dogs, you'll end up with fleas. üòÇ""

Suits S1-4 Bodyguard. 6/10 Finished Money heist last night. 9/10. American Crime Story: Assasination of Gianni Versace Doom Patrol

This show is the best thing I've seen in quite some time. All the actors, especially Brendan Fraser are amazing. Last binged: Oh My Ghostess 

Binging: The Chalet and Coffee Prince.  West Wing, Banshee and Sons of Anarchy. Russian doll for me too House MD. It's brilliant.  Mob psycho 100 season 2 

The dopest anime Mindhunter and It's always sunny in Philadelphia. Currently on air - Gotham, Tbbt, suits, Riverdale.

 On hiatus - the Flash, LOT, AOT(snk) .  Grand Prix Driver on Amazon. It's just 4 episodes but gives great BTS view of how complicated it is to build an F1 car. The show focuses on McLaren in 2017.

 The office and sacred games ""Blandings"", based the novel ""Blandings Castle"" by Wodehouse. The most I have laughed since watching ""Jeeves and Wooster"", by Fry and Laurie. Last watched is a Korean drama ""Radiant office"" which was a light show about job seeking and office life. Currently watching a Chinese drama ""Princess agents"". It's a historic fiction, interesting plot and strong female lead but a bit too violent. The last thing I binged watch was Neon Genesis Evangalion almost 8 months abo. Else I am currently watching 15 titles this season. Peaky blinders Titans on netflix and Hansmaid's Tale before this. IMO the latter is the best drama out there right now arguably, along with Fargo. You. Quite good. Waiting for season 2.  Fringe, American Crime Story, Haunting of the hillhouse The Office! That's what she said!  SHETLAND, all the way! Silicon valley El patron del mal, more accurate than Narcos! Rick and Mortyyyyyyyy biiiiyyyyaatttchhhh!

Edit: This post is just sad as hell.",OnidaKYGel," I lost my father exactly 1 year ago yesterday. Although he was a diabetic but there was never a complication. Then suddenly he suffered a heart stroke and that was it. I unfortunately wasn‚Äôt with him in his last moments. 

I had always practiced this event in my mind that one day he won‚Äôt be there. But when you hear this news you don‚Äôt seem to comprehend it. Nothing makes sense to you at all. All the plans you had made are now gone. You had planned for a surprise family holiday? It‚Äôs gone. You wanted to discuss some random stuff with him? Not possible. You wanted to buy him a new tool kit? Not possible. 

The initial 2-3 months are the worst while your mind rewrites or reroutes your thoughts to navigate around the void that‚Äôs  just been created. Your keep asking yourself what if you had done that or what if you were there etc .

And then gradually time heals everything and you learn to live with his memories. Life goes on. I lost my mom before my 10th grade exams and my dad 3 months ago.... I'm currently writing my final sem exams. It sucks big time especially when you're not expecting someone to just go away suddenly - the case with my dad. 


Both my mom and dad had chronic illnesses, I don't even wanna name what the illnesses were coz they were so bad I wish nobody has to go through what they went through. Hospital and medical expenditure was so high that we couldn't save a penny and as result, right now, my final condition is very pathetic and I have two sisters to take care of. We still don't have our own house we still live in a rented house in 2019, we have no property, no land, nothing. Most of our relatives are scums, they never supported my dad when he was ill and we don't expect anything from them so we like to maintain our distance.


Mentally speaking, I'm depressed, hopeless, shattered. I still am not over my Dad's death. He would have lived had he agreed to go to the hospital earlier so there will always be this guilt with me, I'll always feel like I couldn't save my dad and I have to live with it.


 Speaking of the future, I just don't know what to do now from here. Nothing's going the right way for me. My dream is to crack UPSC civil services exam but UPSC will take time and i don't have time, i have to find a job quick asap after my exams so I'll probably do some odd jobs and give some easier government exams for now and then I'll see what I can do. 


It's like I don't have a purpose for living anymore but I'm trying. Trust me, nothing is worse than losing both your parents. Please spend everyday with your parents like it would be their last so you don't have any regrets like me. Life is cruel and you cannot predict what's going to happen next. Lost my Dad in 2016. I've never been truly happy since then. I always get stressed or mad at even the most silliest thing and it's genuinely ruining my life. Haven't yet managed to think that he's truly gone. :( Depends on what age you lose them, what kind of relation you had, and your own nature.

When you get older and lose them, you get over it faster.  If they were suffering from a major illness, you will be relieved that they are gone.

I run a small engineering firm and make more then enough to live a happy, comfortable and also few luxuries. Worked very hard to be where I am.

So I found out that my wife is cheating. I am 39 and she is 33 and we have two kids, a girl and a boy. I am very upset. The marriage is broken irreparably. I want out.

I have an appointment with lawyer next monday to discuss this over. The wait of next two days sees unbearably long. 

Knowing my wife, I know it's going to be a big drama which I want to avoid at all costs. I just want to put evidence of her activities before her and part our ways silently. What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? I will also hire a PI the first thing the next week.

I'd like to have full custody of our children. Does anyone know under what conditions will I be able to get that?

EDIT:

Thanks for all your responses. Few were helpful, few disturbing and few others distasteful. Anyway, I am just normal at home as if nothing happened. I have a strictly predictably routine and I intend to keep it that way. I am off to drop my daughter at her friend's place who is celebrating her birthday today.

I am very methodical and I'll deal with this issue just like that. I am going to write down everything I plan to do, rehearse it multiple times with my lawyer (he responded), plug holes and build a solid case.

There are many suggesting that I don't monitor her activities as it's illegal. I can appreciate that. But I am anyway going to do it. What's important to me primarily is the evidence, the truth and the full picture. What I do with it is totally a different matter altogether. I may not tell her, I may just poke and see the response, I may not not use the evidence for legal proceedings (and that's up to lawyer anyway) or I may just burn it all. The world doesn't need to know I employed an investigator to collect evidence, legal or not.",ThisSuggestedName," [deleted] Hey, I am fighting a domestic violence case filed against me by my wife. There are a few things I want to share.            

First things first. Custody mostly goes to mothers and the fathers get visitation rights on weekends, festivals etc. The legal system in India is highly biased in favor of women. Not to discourage you, but adultery in India is very difficult to prove. In one case, a man produced pictures of his wife in compromised positions with another man, and in turn his wife filed a new case of outraging her modesty. It is not impossible, but difficult.       
      
Now, main issue: money. Everything will come down to money. How much are you willing to give to her so that she says yes for a divorce. They call it settlement, which in easy words is extortion. Everybody in the system, right from clerk to judge will ask you to settle. Lumpsum money or else monthly maintenance for her. If you file a divorce, chances are you will get a 498A, DV, 125 package in return.      
      
This are some of the problems, now some solutions. Main: gather all the evidences that you can, each & everything, document everything and she shouldn't know about it. Gather her job records & salary slips (if she is working) and education records (if she isn't working). List down all your assets and liabilities. Document stuff that shows she has been a careless mother.      
      
If you are able to prove adultery beyond a reasonable doubt, you have cracked it. SC said that a wife committing adultery is not entitled to get any maintenance or other monetary benefits.        
      
Most importantly, keep a cool head. Don't lose heart. Happens with many of us and you are not the only one who is wronged. Be motivated and never lose your focus on your job/work. Your value is just because of your job/work.  Document everything. Meticulously. Chat msgs from years back, your paper documents, the money you both spent, everything. As detailed as you can. You never know what can come useful. Don't confront until you have solid evidence.

Custody is something that usually isn't affected by adultery. As in you aren't going to get full custody simply because of the fact that your wife cheated. Economics and stable environment are the key factors there.

The simplest way to get access to FB or phone lock is to stand behind the person when they're unlocking and sneak a look. Then ask to make a call or something and use it. There's no magic hacking apps or something like that so try not to download a virus in the enthusiasm.

Stay calm, go take a walk or a long shower. As in chess, when you're position is disadvantaged, it's time to slow down, consolidate your position and think about the next move carefully. Not throw the game in anger. Good luck and keep us posted OP. [removed] I‚Äôd recommend you in any emergency case of a 498A/125DV, connect to Shonee Kapoor. This guy literally nailed his own case with a victory (Adultery and post that False 498A. Court had quashed his case and he didn‚Äôt have to give any kind of maintenance)

Hope you are fine brother. Please collect as much evidence as you can. Phone call recordings, pictures, chats, SMSes, every goddamn thing you have against her.

Very high probability that the opposition lawyer will suggest your wife to file all those 498A 125DV bullshit charges for sure so that they could harass you more.

Hell, these things literally deter me from getting married in the future. [removed] women tend to have an upper hand in these situations my question is the person married or not? Sorry to hear that buddy. I can only wish you good luck... and offer you a beer. Keep your chin up. Take a paternity test. Sincerely Dude consult a family lawyer he would be able to give you far better advice than any user out here. Marriage and divorce are huge thing in India so there is no escaping the family drama. Lesson learnt. Never gonna get married
 First up, remove the personal details you have supplied in the first post. Can easily be passed on to your spouse if somebody connected + adept at reddit goes through it. 1) Adultery is grounds for divorce.

2) Regarding custody. It is generally true that it is awarded to the mother. However, in this case her behaviour would be a strong consideration to award it to you.

Disclaimer: nothing in this comment should be construed as legal advice. Please contact a lawyer. From now on you may want to screenshot all chats with her and also record phone conversations.  > What kind of technology can I use to monitor her email, phone (voice and text), social media communications (Fb) for few days? 

Do not go down this path. You'll come out worse off than before.  How did you find out ?  Is the evidence fool proof?

Who is the guy she is cheating with? Hey, I'm a little late to the thread, but I thought I'd chime in, a bit, being a lawyer. 

You're being remarkably level-headed about this, which  is a huge plus. that being said, I understand your motivation to gather evidence, but make sure you do nothing illegal. You don't want to have a criminal case against you, and, as others have said, our judicial system is quite biased towards women. A competent lawyer could easily allege stalking, outraging the modesty of a woman, indecency, etc. 

Another thing is to make sure you go to the right lawyer. You mentioned you're going to the best lawyer in the city. Make sure he/she also practices in the district courts, where your case will be filed. The best lawyers usually tend to practice in High Courts and the Supreme Court, and lose touch with trial court practice. 

If you have anything you need to ask, feel free to message me. I hope everything works out for you. Hit the lawyer, Delete Gym, Facebook Up. If you have multiple devices lying around like an extra tablet, iPad and by any chance if she's logged into FB on those device/s you could use that to read her FB chat logs and take screenshots. 
Don't confront her without evidence plan with your lawyer. 
I have no experience but I have read and seen movies and I'm speaking from those stories.  Pretty sure you are taking the right decision. Get off that cheating piece of shit. erm, pretty sure it's illegal to monitor her email/phone i will not recconmend you to do any spying on her phone but ....but you can use some simple technique to unlock her phone when she is not there ..and also fb or whatsapp massage willnot b a better evidence as u need hard evidence a video or photograph ...maybe install a webcam  Look dude i don't have any idea about this stuff but most of the people here are saying to gather enough evidence so i will suggest try to hire a private investigator who will help you with that stuff, also contact your lawyer about this. If you don't have any evidence, then play it cool. Or else, she will figure out something is up, and guess you know. In which case, she might file fake domestic violence charges against you to make your future claims look unreliable. Also, I would recommend you delete this post too. Just in case she or her lover frequents this sub. firstly freeze your bank accounts and other valuables so that wife does not have access...then collect as many evidences as possible video and audio recordings work best..after all this confront your wife and ask your divorce..tell her that you have strong evidences if she resists Hey OP, firstly I‚Äôm really sorry to know you‚Äôre in such a situation. It sucks. However you seem to have a level headed plan for the future. Don‚Äôt listen to folks who are suggesting you to stay married just for the sake of kids/ family blah blah blah. Cheating is a dealbreaker and nothing can amend that.

The toughest part is the legal battle ahead of you and you making sure that you don‚Äôt end up with a bad deal by the court. Therefore, don‚Äôt confront. Gather evidence. Pretend to act normal until you have it all and are confident that your case is strong. Only then proceed with filing a case etc. 

Best of luck OP. More power to you.  Whether you want a divorce or not is entirely your decision. Don't listen to any of the toxic advice on here regarding that. 

The best thing you can do now is think of her purely as the mother of your children and not your wife. Try and be as mature as you possibly can for the sake of your children. 

Asking for full custody of your children (hence depriving them of a mother) because she cheated on you is unfair on you, her and MOST importantly your children. It will also make you look vengeful and petty. More than that it will really affect your relationship with your kids in the future. Her cheating on you is no indication of her being a bad mother. 

Lastly, for god's sake DO NOT try to track her communication, stalk her or snoop around. As you know it's illegal and if the court/she find out, it will make you look really, really bad. You say you are not planning to do that to gather evidence for the court. Why else are you doing this then? How on earth will doing this help you deal with the situation? You say she is dramatic but if you do this then you are fighting fire with fire. 

Go to a good lawyer and listen to them. Reddit is not the place to get advice for this stuff. This place is full of immature teens and young adults who have no idea what you are going through and they've probably never been in a relationship before. They are (self-admittedly) giving you advice based on movies!! You don't need this right now. Go to a lawyer and stop listening to reddit. 

I'm sorry for what you are going through. I hope you are able to deal with this well and be there for your children. This is going to be really difficult for them so try and make it as easy as possible for them. Don't make them choose between you and her, they need both parents. Good luck OP :) Fucking hoes man. And the damage is almost unrepairable. 
Been so long,  I still can't trust anyone. 
Good luck mate. How old are your kids? It's very difficult for the father to get custody of his teenage children. You should take advice from the PI only regarding snooping her. Is that even legal? And why don't you confront her, it will be messy but might really prevent some miscommunication on your part. You can't monitor her phone and social media, that's illegal.  Don't break the law as part of collecting evidence any sensible lawyer she hires will have that shit thrown out and hurt your case irreparably. I'd say it's lucky that she doesn't know you know, keep it that way and follow the advice of your lawyer. Hello OP, sorry to read about the pain you are experiencing. I know that extra marital affairs have become extremely common in India and most people including the cheating spouse are not aware of the problems and pains it causes, which can be extreme. Many people have given you advice in this thread so I won't try to offer you that, but I request something from you. From reading your replies it is clear that you have experienced a great psychological trauma. I want you to please share your thoughts and feelings about this major incident of your life. What went through your mind, did you feel disgusted, insulted, outraged, what kind of topics did you think a lot upon, etc. I think this will help many people who are reading this thread and it may also help you release some built-up pressure by explaining in detail your pain and suffering. I'll be very obliged. a. In cases of adultery, the married one most of the times isn't willing to give up the marriage for the lover's sake. The lover is dropped like a hot potato when the marriage is at stake. If you are open for reconciliation, you can go through therapy to fix things. Obviously it's hard to place faith in someone involved in infidelity. But it's your choice. You have kids. If you don't want your kids to grow up without their mother, you can consider this option.

b. Technical info like call logs, location history etc. is tracked by Google Activity by default unless turned off. But you need access to her gmail id to avail that. It could be add on to whatever you gather from PI. 

Wish you the courage and strength to face this difficult times.  [deleted] Welcome to the club. Enjoy your future days !!! [deleted] When you finally decide to talk this over make sure you are ready with all sorts of trail and evidence. Ok I know you‚Äôre upset and you have every right to be, but you‚Äôre asking for full custody because she cheated? You‚Äôre going to take your anger which you justifiably have towards your wife on your children by depriving them of their mother. I‚Äôm not sure how the law works where you are but where I am, emails and all that begotten without consent of the other person do not count in a court of law. Hire a PI. And also, do what‚Äôs best for your kids. She may be a shit wife but she has a right also to her children.  This is not the right forum. Consult, r/relationships, r/relationship_advice, specifically mention that you are in India. Hi, its upsetting to read this, but from my experience of being standing and seeings a frnds irreparable marriage.. i would like to suggest something.. is it the first instance this this is happening? I mean had your alwaays marriage been in problems? How did this all start..? The the distance between 2 of you increasing after any particular event? What i want to say is the the cheating only reason? Had she never loved you? The cheating is more of a need for love or togetherness or just cheating? Also one more thing.. has your daily life with her gone worse.. like daily fights or and things? Or u just act cool and she does too? Just pretend we all are cool and lovely?

 I may sound wrong.. but we all know when things start to go wrong, the distance between people starts increasing.. if you really love her.. and you can find a human reason for what she is doing can that can be repaired.. i would suggest you take a higher stand than her.. i know its hard. But at the end you would know u are better, u gave her chance.. maybe there might be some mistakes u must have made on the way, that she wanted to distance from you.. and find love somewhere else . But you know we are humans, and we need love .
The only thing i would to suggest you is if feel this is not cause of the distance that had been growing since time . U keep gathering your evidence.. and keep it safe.. look it at a perspective of why would she do that.. find a reason in those evidences and history u have together.. sometimes people drift away in search of love... I donno who to blame in these cases.. but as a person with understanding the human nature can we give try to give human instinct some chance? I think we can... 

From my experience.. i would suggest u gather evidences, with mere goal of knowing whats wrong( if this looks more like cheating than just a person trying to go away)..u will know if its  a sexual escapade or a find for love.. u will be able to see those in chats or anything.. while at it, i would suggest u try to talk to her.. not openly.. maybe ask her whats wrong why has your relationship detoriated over time(if it has) maybe she wont open up.. it will take time.. make sure you u dont sound like u are accusing her of cheating... Coz  that thing is going to make her feel guilty as hell and she wont let u know anything further..

If your goal is to just leave her.. then dont think about what i have said above.. but is you plan it know things and what has gone wrong, coz all this pain you and u cant bliv this has happened.. u can try to talk and know whats wrong.. no need to present evidences.. maybe she comes back if she starts to realise the distance has increased and she has done a grave mistake.. 

All d best OP. We humans are the capable of mistake as well as forgiveness.. dont forget this dont need to continue.. u may have already tried all those things i have said above.. maybe u are at the brink on ""no way out"".. so i can understand.. u need to have ur freedom too.. ur peace of mind too.. have a great day OP. [deleted] I can give you the exact value of PI. Don't monitor her personal stuff. It doesn't look good on your part.

Questions you need answer to yourself.  how is she as a mother? Would the kids be okay with you getting sole custody? It seems like you have not confronted with her yet. May be you have not been available much to her. She is human after all. This is perfectly repairable, you need to be more understanding and accepting. Don't take this step. Ignore other guys advising about divorce, collecting proof etc. It depends :

1. Try to hint to her and warn. See if it can improve the situation.

2. If you really love her or she loves you, there is still hope.

3. If you believe in virginity and all those stuff.

4. By all means try to fix it and live with her. Else life of kids will be a mess. If mother has affair that can hurt kids badly (if father has affair, not that much).

Think well and decide. 
All the best.  Man. Try to amend this relationship. You are breaking your home.

You are looking into years of litigation, including dowry, maintainance, child custody, and possibly defamation/rape/more if your wife is clever. Your whole life will become a mess. Children divided.

Do yourself a favor. Don't get involved in this mess. I am facing such mess and it's not worth it.

Give her one last warning. And discuss the problems frankly with her. Maybe you are not giving her enough time. She is a human after all.",2019-03-03 03:15:42
AskIndia,"[AskIndia] How would you like an app-based, healthy tiffin service?",101,b2vyxr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b2vyxr/askindia_how_would_you_like_an_appbased_healthy/,79,"The amazing people of this sub, I need your thoughts and suggestions! I'm interested in making a small app that,

- offers tiffin service with actual healthy food

- caters most items, from gym diet to regular parathas

- has cancellations with refunds

How do you feel about such a service? Will you be willing to pay a little extra for it? (Assuming you like the food and everything!) Will you personally try it? Or do you think it's dumb? 

Also, here's a small anonymous  [10 question survey] (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScW9VaIbANplEGv8S6mRDfZbi0CuX1win6wqD_aB4TDE9y_vg/viewform) just in case you have a minute to spare!
",thecodersblock," Eat fit is already doing it. Stealing your idea. Cya later I think it would be a good idea. There used to be a few services like this in Bangalore (redcooker or something along those lines). 

Why not go for a model like Blue Apron in the US, wherein the user subscribes for pre portioned ingredients with recipes in a way that's user friendly for beginners to make? I love to cook and experiment, but the daily grind ensures that 90% of the time I end up eating out or ordering takeaways.  Sounds like a good idea to me. I'd definitely use it and would be willing to pay a little extra, just don't make a fool of customers with exorbitant airport like prices for tiny portions. Absolute hygiene is my number 1 priority. Glove, cap and sterilize the shit out of everything possible. And dont just say it.Give us proof. Get external agenices to audit the hygiene(if such agencies exist) and also post thorough Hygiene standards and rules so that we can hold you accountable. Put uo youtube videos of kitchen tours. Ok now lets come to nutriton. Obviously do your research and make everything healthy but also add an Organic tier. The Organic variety should have the main things like chcken and milk sourced orgamically, i.e., without pesticides or hormones etc. And lastly money. You guys need to make the least possible profit that fits your model or else this system fails. And Also reach out to cities where similar services dont exist yet(cover all the metros to begin with). Thats about it :) Honestly I guess you guys are already done with all the planning and investing phase and are going to launch soon so whats done is done, but still one can hope, can he not Done. FYI there is an app on Google play store called ""Fofi"" which does the same. Restricted to Chennai though. Like Tinmen?  Where is your would be startup based?  How is this different from eat. fit or half a dozen 'health food' restaurants listed on swiggy right now?

I was witness to the great ""food tech"" boom of 2014, couple of which promised calorie counted, nutrition counted, healthy meals. None of them survived. Why not become an aggregator for homechefs? There are quite a few home run catering services and mom's who cook everyday for their family, if they have an extra meal which might be wasted or forcefully eaten, you can use it and just need to take care of packaging and delivery. Homemade meal averages out to Rs 30 per meal (3 rotis, daal and one veg), you can buy it for 50 and then sell it with packaging and delivery for a nominal profit and at the same time get mom's in to the gig economy.  All the best, OP. Check out [Food darzee](https://www.fooddarzee.com/) if you haven't already. They pretty much do the same. A suggestion: Give detailed nutritional detail for each meal plan, to be viewed upon button click or something. And maintain the quality and taste of food while meeting the nutritional detail exactly.  Box8 also did this, cooking food and delivering it, but I doubt they couldn't run this long. Also, any type of delivery business is the worst idea.

Edit - in Mumbai, some restaurant also does it on personal portal like hellogreen.in Eat.fit-Cult is already there I am a budget user. If i get healthy meals at 50 - 70. I will be more than happy. 

* Curefit is very costly. Suppose each meal cost around 150. So for 25 days it comes around as 3750. Which is 25% of 15000 rupees.
* 15000 rupees is standard salary of freshers, BPO people who are in large numbers. So curefir meals constitute 25% of salary,
* If you bring the cost to 1/3 rd  of 3750 i.e 1250 will be glad to buy it. definitely an untapped and good idea in india! try to include more of local stuff unlike ichef. also follow try following blue apron's business model as something on the side for cheaper prices. i definitely see potential in mumbai.  actually sounds like a good idea.  Definitely sounds like a good idea for big cities. Cult fitness in bangalore already does it and it looks popular- at least from zomato reviews.

My only request would be eco friendly/bio-degradable packaging, if you are moving forward with the idea.  another one? I used one app, TinMen which does exactly this. Check the food subscriptions here in US, you may be inspired. Subscriptions here send portioned out meal kits to make your own food, this works because you don't need to do any shopping or measure quantities. There's a spice only subscription too. You mean [eat.fit](https://eat.fit) version 2.0 ? Gym diet please! I can't make chicken at home will eat outside if there's a tiffin app  The market is already saturated with similar services. Since you are entering a crowded space, your customer acquisition costs for the first 2 years are going to be very high.

Inspite of all the odds , the Indian consumer is moving towards healthy and organic food and there is still a huge market for it, if your able to offer something unique to consumers, you will succeed. I personally would love a good app based tiffin service, I have tried some, but the food becomes too routine after some time and doesn't feel worth the exlenditure anymore. So my suggestion would be to try and make the menu have some surprise elements, so that every meal feels different. Also, I don't know if it's logistically possible, but customizable amount of spices would be a great feature for a tiffin service. That said, all the best OP. I'm going to ask you the same questions I anyone when they talk about their idea.

* The product (what is it, use case, who would want it)
* The market (TAM, size, competition, dynamics to be aware of)
* Product analysis / comparison against competition
* What stage are you in? Do you need money? Are you raising?
* Customer conversion strategy (where do you find them, and how do you make them buy  from you?)
* Why you? Why are YOU the best person for this job? (experience? good team? rich daddy who can't bring himself to pull the plug? what?)
* Have you thought differently about this idea differently? what are you offering that's different from others in the same market? Better business plan would be to import Huel.com from UK and sell it in India on Amazon. Like Swiggy?",2019-03-20 00:25:44
AskIndia,"[AskIndia] What brands of personal grooming (shampoo, soaps, face wash etc) are actually of a good quality and you refuse to cheap out on?",127,aoo0i0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aoo0i0/askindia_what_brands_of_personal_grooming_shampoo/,155,I feel like most budget brands are very harsh and do more harm than good. ,gymshoos," Thank you OP for this thread. Lot's of useful info
 Stop using head and shoulders. Go sulfate free. Use conditioner, everytime you shampoo. Shampoo 3 times a week or less. Stop taking ice cold showers, take hot shower to open up pores and exfoliate, then go cold to close up your pores, moisturize your skin when you get out after you dry off. Drink more water. Wash your face every day and moisturize after. 

Stop using head and shoulders, it is too alkaline for your skin and the fact is you probably dont have dandruff. Flakes is not dandruff. 

Hair styling products (salons sell) will not make your hair fall out. Hot water will not make your hair fall out. I dont care what your friend said they are wrong. Turmeric will not make your hair grow more. Henna is bad, I know it's natural, I know your people have used it for 1000s of years. It is bad for your hair. 

Pomade is your friend, dont be afraid.

-sincerly your friendly American stylist who works with tons of Indian tech guys. Forest Essentials. Olay facewash, a light yellow colored packet, beats others to the dust in terms of skin friendliness and its impact. 

Garnier and such brands are so heavy on the skin. Vicco Turmeric, nahi cosmetic. Vicco turmeric cosmetic cream! Half the products mentioned here, I had never heard the brand names before now !  
I didn't know such things existed !!  
What science, what technology!!!  
Is this India? Face wash - Avene Cleanance Gel. Costs a bomb but the quantity is huge and value for money.

Moisturiser - ~~Avene~~ Aveeno moisturising lotion. It moisturises really well without making the skin feel oily or greasy.

Shampoo - I usually keep changing them after a few months. Started using St. Botanica recently. Too early to give an opinion.

Soap - I use Biotique Almond Oil soap(for lazy days) and keep trying different body washes. Current one is from Palmolive. I like it because it has a scrubby texture. CeraVe was nice but global shipping on Amazon takes time now I just use Cetaphil.  I have long curly hair so most shampoos make my hair super dry and brittle. I switched to biotique sulphate free shampoo and it has made a huge difference but I dont think biotique is like an expensive brand. 

If you feel something is harsh try to read the ingredients list and pick shampoos and soaps that are milder. I cheap out on a lot of stuff especially make up but the only thing I feel I have to spend money on for quality is perfume.  Life Buoy and Dettol products for asli mard. Patanjali if you want skin cancer. Medimix. The hard green one. Lush. Body Shop.  I'm almost 17 and I use johnsons baby shampoo and my hair is good [deleted] Fabindia Daily Use Shampoo fiama ke bath soap and gel...

especially wo purple wala. All I use is soap. I don't care what soap it is. Usually something normal like Lux, Mysore Sandal,etc. I stopped using everything else. Was addicted to Ponds body lotion for the last 10 years and have been addicted to steaming hot water baths all my life. So I started cold water showers.  I stopped using shampoos and conditioner as well. /r/NoPoo. Also was using hair products like smoothing serum n all of that. I have long hair that goes down to over half of my back.

All of it was starting to become a bit too much really. I used to face a lot of inconvenience while traveling. Cant have a bath if there's no hot water or shampoo/conditioner or body lotion. A lot of maintenance and effort and as a guy i felt i don't have to deal with all of this bullshit. I don't have the time and got more important things to deal with. And life is so much fucking better and simpler now. Now as long as I have just the bare essentials which I need(bath soap, toothbrush, toothpaste and a tongue scraper), im good to go anywhere :) Gaumutra Proraso for all shaving needs. A customer for 9+ years and their products are top tier. Facewash: Bioderma Sebium (Gel)

(I don't have any other options really, since most make me break out while this is has worked amazingly well for me).

Shampoo: L'Oreal Mythic Oil shampoo & Mask

Moisturizer: Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer

(It's a sunscreen too and zero breakouts).

Soap: Prefer a body wash: Neutrogena Rainbath shower gel.

These are non negotiable for me. My shaving cream on the other hand..... Lol....  Shampoo - If you can afford it for regular use Kerastase Densifique is really really good to control hairfall. I have been using it regularly for a year now and results are amazing. Not for dandruff control though. Use something else for that, along with Kerastase Face : Cetaphil cleanser, cerave moisturizer

Hair care : shea moisture shampoo, wow coconut oil conditioner. 

Body : loccitane shea butter soap (this is maybe the best thing I have found in recent years), cerave moisturizer again. 

Shaving : trigodon shaving soap, nivea sensitive after shave balm (this stuff is good)

hair styling : lockhart's goon grease pomade 

Fragrance : a few EDPs from Swiss Arabian (very high quality for the price, especially if you live in uae )

Everything listed here can be bought off of Amazon.in Cetaphil light moisturiser, palmers night cream. Anything non comedogenic is good. Stopped using manufactured bullshit a while back. For shampoo, buy amla, reetha, shikakai, boil it together, if you wanna store, freeze it. Lovely simple stuff for hair.
As an alternative to soaps, face wash, get multani mitti, gulaab jal, dahi, milk, i have a rose powder don't know what it's called, basically take different things, figure out what works well for your skin, mix & match & make ubtan out of it. Tum bhi saaf, Nahane ke baad wala paani bhi saaf.
It's not cheaping out, there really isn't anything in the market I think is good enough. I don't use it because I don't know all the shit they put in it.  Mysore Sandal Soap, Himalaya face wash, Biotique soya shampoo. Anything Nivea. I swear by it. Shaving foam, shampoo, face wash, moisturise r, everything. It's just good. And also not exorbitantly expensive. 

I Just don't find nivea soap that easily,  **Nivea Men's Oil Control Face Wash** - 
It's not really expensive but is a must if you have oily face. Also I love the cool menthol feeling

**Alfred Sung Cologne** -

This scent combines the freshness of basil with the earthy tone of sage. Juniper berries and caraway add a sweet, floral essence to the masculine scent, and its pepper note adds a hint of spiciness. Just one or two sprays will leave you smelling clean and feeling fresh throughout the morning and afternoon.


 search for paul Mitchell on Amazon  I prefer Biotique BioApricot.  Great Body Wash.

&#x200B;

I used Body Shop for a long time. But Biotique is by far the most luxurious and cost effective thing.  Use fiama or nivea men shower gel, i like them both [deleted] If you are with a beard, try Cinthol beard and face wash, beard oil and wax.
They are not cheap. But they are very cheap in comparison to the competition. Coconut virgin oil from Amazon instead of the regular parachute. Costs double but my hair love it. Idk what it is with parachute oil but it sucks. Nothing, it is all bollocks, I use bar soap and coconut oil. Himalaya Neem face wash and Nykaa Rosehip Oil for moisturiser  I would recommend Mysore sandal soap. It has the highest TFM 80%. Medimix soap. The BodyShop, Clinique

&#x200B;

Edit: About two months back switched to Skinkraft's range of customized face care products(cleanser, moisturizer and night cream). I am not using them daily as recommended, but have noticed a difference in appearance, mainly, more clear skin and fading of some dark spots. The main compliment I can give them is that there products do not cause any irritation.  Nivea all the way.
Body wash,
Face creme,
Moisturizer,
Chapstick,
Face wash,
Cleansing milk.

That's my nivea routine Soap - Life boy and Dettol. Despite all the shit about scented and what not by the competition, there's one thing you must remember. You live in India. Everything smells, you need as much anti-bacterial stuff as humanly possible to remain alive. So ditched the scented stuff and stick to Life Bouy and Dettol # Patanjali Forever My favorite soap is Cuticura. Rest I am yet to find something that I can stick to. Currently using Brylcreem Shampoo and Bombay Shaving Company face wash. Both are fine.  Old Spice. The body wash and underarm sticks from the US, cream and aftershave from here. 
 Anyone follows this YouTube channel Fit Tuber. He made a series about all these products based on ingredients. His claims are scientific but I'm not able to confirm them. Does anyone know how valid his claims are? Neutrogena facewash Cetaphil is an amazing face cleanser. It's worth a buy. 
For body products the body shop is one of the best brands you can buy. 
And , Boutique is another. The difference being, boutique is relatively cheap.  Kama ayurveda is good  Was recommended by a friend - small-ish company based in Pune called Vaidyam Healthcare. 

I have been using their hair oil. It did make a lot of difference. All their products are chemical free, so that's something. they have listed out all the ingredients they've used.

""When are you going to grow up?"" 'Jitna badha hora hain, utne sing arahe hain '  Aag laga de is phone ke Idk if it counts as a catchphrase, but ""look at [your cousin]"" followed by comparison du jour. I see it as amusing now when I'm older, but damn those comparisons drove me mad.  Tumse na ho payega beta, na padhai m hoshiyaar ho, na job mil rahi h, na hi tu kisi kaam k kaabil h aur girlfriend toh tere naseeb m h hi nhi.


Sad but bitter truth. *""Shaadi karle....""* In konkani.

""Kaale?awoichi hadaa soduun asai?""

""What? searching for your mom's bones/skeleton?""

Seeing it translated, sounds really creepy. But it's basically an expression for looking for something. Or if you are lost ij thought.

Don't know the origin though. Or why anyone ever came up with such an expression. Tujhe bahar padhne bhejke galti kar di Looking at me and Dad - it's like I'm raising two kids in this house!!!!  When you leave for college, I'll rent a room near your hostel so I can cook food for you.

This isn't said in some nice wholesome way, it's a threat, haha. Jo karna hai wo karo (Do whatever you want to do)
It's a definite NO wrapped under the thick layer of sarcasm ""Rukja chimta garam karke laa rahi hu agar badmaashi band nahi kari to"" 'Jo bi hota hai ache ke liye hota hai' 

Also less common

'Paise ki tension na lia kar' (I'm a masters student in USA, so money issues)
'har time sab khush ni hote' (She means that it's life you can't be happy all the time)

She's pretty wise, she's a Hindi teacher for ~40 years. ‚ÄúChhaan‚Äù

I heard this everyday when I was in school. Now I'm 30 and this phrase still haunts me. Sar par haath rakh ke kha meri kasam ""Achaaaaaaaaaa"" tari vastu thekana par rakh

From the last year's cutoff, She can get -
Civil, Engineering Physics, Production engg, at DTU. Not so much at NSUT except BioTech. Good NITs are really tough to get, being from Outside state. Don't prefer sending her to North East states as it will be far. Also Delhi being Delhi has scope for much better opportunities. I feel Civil will be the best bet for her. 

- She could prepare for Software - get ample free time
- She could continue in Civil - get through IES
- prepare for UPSC - being at Delhi might help
- go for MBA 

Engineering Physics can be beneficial only if she is highly interested and capable in Physics and would want to go for Higher Studies. That she doesn't have any idea of at this stage. 

What do you advice? For eg. Someone suggested to get into Thapar Electronics but I don't think that would be a good idea. DTU is way better collg than Thapar imo. Only dampener is, I have heard, that there is NO branch-change in DTU!? Any other options???

Kindly help. I don't have much idea about jee mains and am confused by so many number of colleges.",poco_gamer," What does she herself want?

She should go for BioTech or Engineering Physics if she is interested in academic research (which generally means that she would have to pursue further studies/PhD). 

IMO software industry is stale and hopeless. 

I personally would advise her to go for research (cause I think more Indians should do that) but then again not everyone is made for research and it depends on what she wants too. I doubt She'l get CE or EP, to be honest. Chances are more towards Environmental and BT, can you point me to the cut off list of 2018 which says 50k got Civil?

It is no longer active and the interim orders issued under it as per our understanding have lapsed. We are examining steps on this and holding internal conversations on an approach strategy.

We don't have Hugh Hefners and Larry Flynts in India. nobody wants to be the known as the guy who stood up for porn.   Because it costs around 2500 to file a petition while VPN is free.  In India, the only sanskaari porn is Kamasutra. Rest is all western propaganda. Because Ekta Kapoor wants you to watch her sleazy shows instead of porn. everybody is waiting for others to start. they will just support. yrah but theyve banned streamable and im too lazy to turn on VPN everytime.  I've experienced something weird. I'm not technically apt to point my finger on it. There were certain obscure porn sites that survived the blanket ban. YOURPORNdotSEXY and the likes. They worked fine but now even these aren't opening anymore. Are they collecting user data and updating their list? Wtf is happening? Isp: Jio

AskIndia,[AskIndia] How do you keep yourself fit?,43,aq83ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/aq83ya/askindia_how_do_you_keep_yourself_fit/,48,"What does your exercise routine look like? 

What are your short and long term fitness goals? 

What kind of diet do you follow? 

If you don't train then what's stopping you? 

Any fitness related achievement you want to share?

Edit: I am not seeking any advice here, I just want everyone to share their routines and spark a discussion so that people can ask questions to each other and learn. 

",LongDraft," I didn't realize the importance of deiting till I got into medschool.

Some tips:

 -You need 1g /kg body weight of protein to keep you fit everyday. So if your weight is 70kg eat 70g of protein everyday. 1 egg contains 6g of protein. If you're trying to lose weight, egg white : egg yolk ratio should be 2:1.
Soya beans , sprouts and lentils are good sources of protein. 


- Count your calories. If you're trying to loose weight eat less than your daily RDA. Google Indian RDA to check what's yours according to your weight. Approx. 2400 for males and 2000 for females. It's not rocket science , once you start counting and managing it'll become easier. 


-  Exercise? 

 I do warm up first followed by

 500 skips (60fast 40slow)

 70 burpees

 100 push ups 

They can be divided in sets of 3

 Abs workout

 
 And individual group of muscles (chest, back , shoulders etc)


- If you swim after that it's a bonus.

Try reading about High Intensity Interval training. 

- Drink lots of water and cut off sugar. Eat stuff like watermoln and cucumber it's low calorie, high fibre and keeps you hydrated. 


- Do something that makes you feel relaxed for me it's Swimming and Mediation (highly recommended, you should be fit mentally and physically)

Have patience it'll take atleast 3 months for you to notice chages. 

 If you just want to lose weight, don't exercise.
Just create a calorie deficit by eating less and moving more. (Moving includes regular walking and general activity)

If you want to get fit and build your body, you should take more protein, less carbs and workout more. Doing this will increase your hunger and appetite. So if you stop working out midway, there's a chance of gaining more weight and fat. 

So workout only if you can commit to your plan. Or else just eat less and create a calorie deficit to lose weight.  hit gym regularly. Initially you gain weight. But if you are regular you would tone up. Results will keep you going afterwards. 

Don‚Äôt diet, eat regular meals. reduce the quantity of carbohydrates (chapathi,rice) increase quantity of the sides (veg,meat) as much. eat seasonal fruits nothing fancy. 

drink water.


keep going!! Was never fat, cycle most days a week, play with a sponge ball in the terrace alone at night because I'm a loser, and that's how I keep my weight in check I walk 10k steps early in the morning in a nearby park. 

My weight has gone from 107.8kg to 96.4 kg in 3 months. My goal right now is to hit 70kg.

I count the calories in my food and ensure that there's a calorie deficit. I eat anything but stay within my calorie limit. For more info go to /r/loseit.  [deleted] **Exercise Routine**

Monday/Wednesday/Friday = bodyweight workouts sourced from the Recommended Routine from r/bodyweightfitness

Tuesday/Thursday/Saturday = different running workouts, between 3.5 and 10km incorporating sprints, fartlek running, easy runs etc.

I mix in yoga whenever I can remember to do some, and will sub in things like football, rock-climbing/bouldering etc whenever I can get a good group of friends together to go for this stuff.

I also make it a hard rule to always walk to where I'm going if it's a distance of less than 2.5km.

**Diet**

I don't follow a diet at all, beyond basic moderation. Try to stick to unprocessed food, but don't break my head over it. I enjoy cooking and baking and eating out wayyyy too much to let it stress me out; I do make sure I get at least 5 helpings of fruits/veggies a day, and eat a lot less rice. It also helps that I hardly ever drink (once in 6 months), and don't smoke.

**Short and Long-Term Fitness Goals**

Short-Term: maintain regularity (I've been working out using the above template for about 2.5 years now).

Long-Term: Achieve some of the more hardcore calisthenic movements/holds (human flags, iron cross, front lever, etc).

**Motivation**

My main motivations are to find an outlet for my stress/anxiety, and to maintain some level of control over my health.

I've always had issues with stress and anxiety, to the point of panic attacks, but working out (in conjunction with therapy) has helped that out a *lot* so knowing that helps me stay motivated whenever I feel like slacking off. 

Exercise to me is just a means to an end, the end being a motivated and healthy body with enough energy to help me get through the rest of my day/deal with my other life goals. So i'm not too fussed about perfecting my physique or going HAM on my diet. Accepting that has helped me be at peace with the fact that I might not be progressing nearly as fast as some of my friends who are more focused/dedicated. Exercise routine is to go to the gym 5 days a week for about 45 mins, each day for a separate body part. I start with legs and get it out of the way because its the most strenuous of the lot. Then I move on to chest, shoulders, back, arms.  


Short term fitness goal is actually to feel happy, I go for the dopamine rush more than anything. Long term, I hope to get away from being skinny fat to toning up a bit, nothing too extravagant  


Diet: I just don't keep eating till I'm full, and don't eat junk often. That should be more than enough for maintaining decent fitness. People recommending fancy diets have outlandish goals as well, I have no such plans.  


Achievement: Clothes fit better, I don't look like a scrawny teenager anymore, and I feel more confident in general. I‚Äôve been following the r/nSuns program the last few months, and have experienced great results. 

I‚Äôve also been keeping track of my diet, and overall, feel fitter and stronger by the day.  I mostly just do jogging after waking up and then some hanging exercises on the hanging bar followed by 50 pushups and 50 squats.  Guys Get a mi scale. This gives a wake up call to you. My body fat and Visceral levels are way above. We always have a positive self -image pg our bodies. 

The readings make me more aware of the food I am consuming . 
 Routine: 5/3/1 Boring but big, T-Nation challenge  https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/boring-but-big-3-month-challenge

So I don‚Äôt do the accessories there, only the main lifts. I accessorise using metallicadpa PPL with the pull lifts on Bench and OHP day, and push lifts on the active rest days with legs on the deadlift and squat day. 

Cardio 20 minutes on bench and ohp day, 30 minutes on ActiveRest and no cardio on leg day. 

Diet: I am currently eating around 2300kcal since I‚Äôm cutting. I go upto 3200 while bulking. My minimum aim is 200gms of protein. Eat 1kg chicken everyday, bulking or cutting. No whey or protein powders. Do take creatine and citrulline.Lots and lot of veggies, wheat bran for fibre. Sometimes I‚Äôll do keto, so I‚Äôll eat cauliflower otherwise it‚Äôs always rice (just convenient to cook and pack). 

Goals: Strength, strength and strength. Currently my stats are 192/160/105kgs on deadlift/squat/bench. Aim for end of year is 230/200/150 while keeping my weight same. Currently around 80kgs body weight at approx 16% body fat. Want to reach 12% at same weight (or maybe 2kgs lesser).

Deadlift.

Barbell Rows.

Front Squat.

Overhead Press/Push Press.

Back lunges.  


I have as little as 30-35 mins for gym so this really works for me. Leaves me sore.   


Also, I make sure I clock 30kms/week running.    
 I know a lot of people are asking you to eat healthy and control diet, but in India, that's next to impossible. The average meals at home/hostel/hotel are really lacking in nutrition, as they're mostly carbs.

After multiple attempts, I finally switched to Intermittent Fasting. Read up on it, it's an easy method and doesn't require you to to alter your lifestyle massively. Dropped 7 kilos in 2 months, along with basic workout - push-ups, pull-ups, and squash twice a week.

The thing is, you must try out every method, but find your own. Most gyaan people dish out is what worked for THEM. ",2019-02-14 05:37:33

So they will capitalize every opportunity in the name of ""wisdom"". It's a common defense mechanism for such people. Because 

1. They want to fuck up your life too.
2. They have nothing else to do.
3. Their own kids do not listen to them and they are depressed. [removed] [removed] I never understand this. How elders think it's right for them to give unsolicited advice, but when i gave unsolicited advice to them, they get offended. ü§∑ Was having my breakfast on the go while waiting for my cab, an elderly lady stops, tells me without anyy greetings, beta zindagi me yaad rakhna kabhi aaj ke baad chaurahe ke beech khade hoke khana mat khana!
And mf just walks away????

How do i disable these pop up notifications  indians believe a person should get respect on basis of his age not for the person he is. youngesters are expected to respect them and elders are expected to guide youngsters and young one is expected to follow that advice. it's just social expectation from elders to give advice  Superiority complex, mixed with the fact that they have a sense of pride and entitlement, that only god knows where it comes from.

Just had 2 uncles I barely know lecture me about my future career plans, with incorrect information and textbook suggestions and just straight away told me all my future plans are shit and they know better, when they themselves are living a less than mediocre life. Kept staring at my shoes and taunting me how I'll earn the littlest amount of money get lost in brands (the only brand he named was Nike, cause he kept glancing at my shoes) and how after that I'll throw away my money and ruin my life.

So when you get this ""free ki advice"", just ""smile and nod boys, smile and nod."" You learn from experiences and they advice you not to take decisions that they took which fucked up their life. I guess cause Indian society is more family oriented compared to western societies which tend to be more individualistic. Eastern countries have historically had a more community/family based social dynamics , look at Japan, China , India etc or its just that they are looking out for someone they care about .  Everyone is clueless but we all want a better life. Doesn't matter if you listen to them or not. What does matter is YOU can show them a way to better life.  Speaking from their experiences. Hey man if you feel it's good advice follow it, if not let it slide. It's not like they keep nagging you. If they are in case just tell that ""mom told me not to listen to you"" Worked couple of times.  They have a lot of free time.  Shastron me ise muft ka gyaan pelna kaha Gaya hai. Every elder is an expert in every field. You give them some chai and they be discussing quantum mechanics with you.  10/10 You will do the same when you're *elder*. 

Listen to what they say, it's not necessary to accept all advise. They've the experience of whole lifetime, probably went to some real shit, some good shit, some terrible shit. I generally respect their opinion and concern

Bhai fans are generally assholes.

People who still support demonetization are too far gone in the head to be reasoned with.^^^also ^^^they ^^^tend ^^^to ^^^be ^^^Bhai ^^^fans.

Restaurants that promise 100 varieties of dosa usually cannot make even a basic dosa properly.

",UngilUndy," Public chutiya hai.  Indian people don't really care much for their lives.

well most of em.. the way roads are crossed, the way trains are clinged on, the way cars are driven, the way electricity lines/boards are set up, the way no-one cares about allowing access to handicaps, the way people wanna go before the ambulance... i can go on and on and on.

it's weird that people show fright when they watch horror movies or when some mob gathers to beat them but the way they go about living each day of their lives doesn't show they care much about taking care of themselves. (i've seen this hold especially true in ""macho men"" and less in women.) [removed] Activists only care for issues while the issues themselves are unpopular or not talked about.  Because they get off on the feeling of being the only ones fighting for it.

They throw protests with 12 people at cafes nobody visits and then complain that society doesn't take the issue seriously.

The moment their issues get momentum from the masses, they find some reason to criticize the movement and stay out of them. When someone popular takes up an issue (like an actor who has 10000x more reach than any activist) or when it becomes a hashtag with millions of people taking part, they won't try use this momentum to strengthen the movement. They'll just belittle it and write long think pieces about how the public/personality is missing the point or how everyone else is wrong and how they and they alone understand the true nuance of the situation.

When the Nirbhaya movement saw massive crowds form across the country, I noticed so many ""feminist"" activists stay out of it because it was a middle-class protest and because ""where were you"" when previous rapes had happened. They criticized the movement instead of adding to it.

I've noticed this happen so many times on so many different issues that I've given up thinking it's limited to just one branch of social activism. My generalization is that activists hate when the people actually take up their issue, because they no longer feel like its ""their"" issue. > Parents are always right. Whatever they do is for your good.

Whenever I encounter such people, which is everyday on the Internet, I temporarily lose my objectivity and feel this country has completely earned the mess she's in and then I begin picturing a day when this regime has the bhakts themselves running for their lives.  Modi fans are Modi fans only because they hate Muslims. They don't give a rat's arse about jobs, growth, Ram Mandir, Gau Mata or any other bullshit. As long as Muslims are harassed, all's well. Most young liberals just want a license for debauchery instead of correcting injustice, scapegoating and subjugation.  If i am from particular religion, i support particular party. You can be happier if you never married.  - Average IITian is smarter than average student from tier II colleges.

PS: I am not an IITian. Talking from experience at workplace. Civic sense in India is very poor I used to work in an office with 75% females. My female colleagues and friends who had children were so overworked, stressed, miserable that it left an impression on my mind. (This was a great company to work for,  they had flexible work hours and WFH options for moms). I would not want my wife to go through that. I am not the kind who would ever stop my partner from pursuing her dreams and career, but I want to make sure that I can earn enough and provide a good life for my family on my own.

Most of my friends think I am silly for refusing the extra income, but at what cost? I'd rather prefer if my wife stayed home and raised my kids than busting her ass for a few lakhs more per year.

Edit: Thanks for sharing your opinions people. This thread is about unpopular opinions, so I shared mine. I am not rigid about what I want, and I am definitely not the kind who think I have the right to impose my will on another adult. Far left and far right wing people are a disaster for a country. Men are awesome. A girl is born sealed from birth until it is opened. A virgin girl means many things accompanied with values, culture, and sexual hygiene. > People who still support demonetization are too far gone in the head to be reasoned with.also they tend to be Bhai fans.

I have a counter for this. Bhai fans are assholes, and they tend to avoid tax, and hence they don't support demonetization :D Ye bikk gayi hai society Civilization is the worst thing happened to us.

Morals and ethics doesn't exist outside human frame of reference. Doing ‚Çπ8 worth of work where ‚Çπ7 worth of work was required, and claiming to have done work worth ‚Çπ100, that one time 5 years back, is our definition of working hard, and excuse for not doing shit now. Entire south tambi/kallu
Entire north north I don't think any of what you wrote is an unpopular generalisation.

In that vein, I'll add some further generalisations:

* Autodrivers are generally assholes.

* Kids driving superbikes are maniacs and I won't shed a tear if their rash driving ends up killing them. Especially when they don't wear helmets. 

* Fuck Royal Enfield. If your dick is small, don't try to compensate by riding a noisy bike.

* Every five years, just vote out whoever is in power. Both Congress and BJP will fuck things up - it's best not to let them have two terms consecutively. 

* Old people should learn to shut the fuck up when it comes to the younger generation. You raised us. We have to deal with the problems you created or couldn't solve. So after a point, you really need to shut the fuck up since your chance is passed.

* If you disagree with something, downvoting doesn't change my mind. Use your words. [removed] [deleted] 1. Those who complain that others are X Y Z are basically talking about themselves. I am yet to meet an open minded person who keeps criticizing others non stop. Sure they will talk shit one day or another but not 24 x 7.

2. ""Feminism"" in India is different from actual Feminism started as suffrage movement by Ms Pankhurst. Feminism means I wont disrespect a woman's opinion just because she is a woman.

3. Men and women need to understand the differences in the gender. Men need to realise that women have their own brain and self respect. Not all need constant pampering and looking down upon. That you are equally responsible for your household. Only girls r not responsible.

4. Generally ppl don't complain for things until it starts affecting themselves.

I have been advised to take Inspiral 10 along with Addwize OD18. However the side effects I've faced are numerous. So, the doctor has since told me to stop the Inspiral and continue with the Addwize OD. I'm still suffering from certain side effects. Is there anyone who can talk to me/help me about this ?",OneLoki," Inspiral 10 is Methylphenidate 10 mg

addwize OD 18 is Methylphenidate 18 mg

Previously you were taking Methylphenidate 10+18 mg = 28 mg.

Now only 18 mg and still facing side effects.


May be you need to lower your dose to 10 mg then increase it as needed. Also find a better doctor.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] What are some one time purchases that improved your life significantly?,121,9yezn3,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9yezn3/askindia_what_are_some_one_time_purchases_that/,277,I purchased a 300ml thermos last year. fucking best purchase ever. now I have homemade tea wherever the fuck I want. What about you?,CaptainPoverty," Those mosquito killer racqets. Significantly improved the evenings in our hostel. I feel like I am a walking murderer with my weapon.  Sony WH1000xm3's

Cant hear everybodys shit now A kindle . 

I didn't buy books cuz they were costly . Just invested in a kindle and read a lot of books . 

An Audible Subscription ( Audio books).  
When I got to working I had an hour long commute on either side , instead of just listening to the same old songs , I got a trial subscription and abused the fuck out of it.  I got myself a hard medical mattress. Man, it improved my sleeping so much. Never realised that my previous spinal pain episodes were induced by the soft and springy mattress.

Best purchase decision in the last 5 years, honestly. Good knife for the kitchen, and a 'combination stone' to keep the knife sharp. A multimeter.

There's only one 'combination stone' available in the market, and that is [this](https://www.amazon.in/Cumi-CSSC109-Combination-Silicone-Carborundum/dp/B00S86FA6M/) available online at \~Rs. 240 and offline(at least here in Sec'bad) at \~Rs. 135/-

[This](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/VICI-VC87-LCD-Digital-Multimeter-True-RMS-DMM-for-Motor-Drives-w-Frequency-Capacitance-Temperature-hFE/32701610512.html) (which cost me \~$99.00 at the time) is the multimeter I have since \~4 years. [This](https://www.amazon.in/Mastech-MAS830L-Digital-Pocket-Multimeter/dp/B0093H048Y) (which cost me \~Rs. 400/-) is what I upgraded from. Air purifier. I live in Delhi Caterpillar trekking shoes when they were available in market about a decade back. Shit still has enough life for another 10 years Noise cancellation headphones (Bose QC 30) for flights. I take at least 2 flights a week and I can sleep on morning flights because of it. 



 Cordless vacuum cleaner. Cleaning house is so much easier, and now house gets cleaned more often. I was putting off buying a microwave for years. It has been life changing since I got it. I get to eat hot food again like it was just prepared. People on the edge, just go ahead and buy it. It's totally worth it.  I bought (almost jokingly) one of those make-up brushes for women to clean my laptop. Lo and behold I clean each and every gadget (and other precious items) with it nowadays. 
Link for those interested: https://www.amazon.in/Vega-Wooden-Handle-Natural-Synthetic/dp/B00791F224/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1542636877&sr=8-5&keywords=vega+makeup+brushes A basic cycle from decathlon. Use this frequently now instead of car for short distances. Got a UPS 5yrs ago... almost forgotten abt power cuts  SSD for my laptop. It is noticeably faster now. An electric shaver/trimmer by Philips. Got it for like 700 something during some promotion. Used to have a lot of skin problems that now I know to be due to my earlier means of shaving (razor/cartridge style blades). Sure, they don't give a close shave but it is good enough and does not cause a lot of skin problems that may happen when you use a blade of any kind on skin. I listen to a lot of podcasts and relaxation/lounge music. But using earphones for longer periods is inconvenient. So I bought a JBL Flip 3 during the sale and I just let it play on my disk while I work. It has a 12 hr battery on 50% volume pleasant to hear. The LG gram laptop for 70k. Batter is soooooooo long. Always lasts full day. And it's only around 900 something gram.

I can now code all day without breaking my back.  A Chromecast, honestly. Don't know why anyone would go for a smart TV anymore. Offers very little functionality over the relatively cheap device.  I collected money for 1year and brought adidas shoes. And it was my best purchase. After that i realised shoes are most important to feel comfortable. I bought a hydroflask 720 ml insulated bottle. 

Cold water all the time!

It was a little expensive but its also got a lifetime warranty theres that.  In Delhi, you get these electric charge hot water bags. Cost 200-250 Rs. Very comfortable in winters. Not one, but almost any high quality item I have purchased has served me really, really well. In contrast, whenever I've saved money on things, they ended up either requiring a lot of repairs or downright upgrading quicker than I thought. Here are a few top picks:

1. Memory foam mattress (significantly improves sleep)
2. High end running shoes from Decathlon (reduce strain on your ankles, don't skimp on shoes!)
3. A 27"" 4K monitor (Man, this thing is amazing to watch movies and youtube on, as well as general browsing and coding. If you are using a laptop, seriously consider attaching it to a monitor and getting wireless keyboard and mouse)
4. A gearless scooter in Bangalore: Here, public transport is non-existent, Uber is too slow/expensive and auto guys fleece you hard. Scooter will easily run you down 8000-10000 km a year and if you think of 20 rupees per km for Uber(standard in Bangalore), it justifies the cost of scooter + fuel in less than a year. Also, gearless is much easier to drive in city traffic.

&#x200B;

In contrast, the cheap chair I bought gives me back pains after long sessions(trying to get rid of it at a loss :( ), the 8 years old second hand fridge required several repairs, and the cheap laptop I bought gave me heating issues and horrible battery life. I have learned my lesson that good stuff lasts longer and pays for itself in that time. Amazon Alexa along with a few connected lights. Very convenient to have it all synced up. Also, if you cook a fair bit or just enjoy cooking, get a good quality knife or 2. Makes cooking so much nicer. [A monitor stand from Amazon basics](https://imgur.com/gallery/xYmihOM) Bought some TheraBands, now  exercise at home. I am way more regular at working out.  A house A laptop cooling pad. Do not worry about laptop heating now. * Water Filter - No more need to buy water Cans 
* Cartini Serated knife 
* Car air pump 
 Chromecast is great. Purchasing dashcam also makes me feel safe while driving. Chromecast... really dont wanna see anything in a small phone screen now.  A good quality mattress with pillow that suits your body.

No amount of exercise and yoga can help your body if your mattress and pillow are not comfortable(doesn't always need to be soft). You spend most of your life of bed(average 6+ hours) so compromising with it is not a good idea.

&#x200B;

I fall asleep fast, have less back and neck pain and cramps even after long duration of sleep thanks to one good investment I made. Raspberry Pi (mini computer board). Installed Kodi. Watching movies from hard disk and YouTube ad free is priceless. Condom strawberry flavor  live in the UK and also spend lot of time in india during holidays so I needed a phone that supports both indian 4g frequency bands and british

&#x200B; Harman Kardon Soundsticks II  


I got them almost 7 years ago during some sale on Flipkart, I think. Picked 'em up for about Rs 7,000. They are by far the most exquisite sounding home-speakers I've owned. Seven years and not a single issue thus far. Anyone who comes over and listens to music on them is immediately wowed by how they handle every genre flawlessly.

Easy pull vegetable chopper Better headphones and better/more comfortable shoes.  Had someone get me a Chromebook from the US. It was the Acer Chromebook 14. Damn it only cost like 250$ but I tend to use it more than my desktop or windows laptop.

It runs off flash storage so it's much faster than my desktop and laptop. It has a really good 1080p IPS screen and weighs practically nothing (it's like 1.5kg) so I do all my viewing on it. Did I mention it literally lasts 11 hours. My 3 year old core-i5 laptop albeit much more powerful lasts only 3 hours at best. For light usage this is better than any device I've had.

AskIndia,[AskIndia] Tell me an yesterday's non-news around you and your neighborhood,86,atcz0u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/atcz0u/askindia_tell_me_an_yesterdays_nonnews_around_you/,90,"News is only when something shit happens. Non-news should be a thing in today's world of instant news and instant shit. Sanity in this insane world that we've never imagined we'll ever be is non-news. And it should be yesterday because you've been through it and it's fresh in mind. I'll go first.

1. Yesterday I saw three donkeys after a very long time. I used to see and hear them almost everywhere. They've become a rare sight while I am growing up. They look old and don't look like they are in a good shape.
2. Yesterday I thought for few minutes why wasn't I am seeing monkeys in my neighborhood? They used to be everywhere in my childhood. That once again reminded me of a video made by one History professor on Pigeons in US. In early 19^th century 
2. Yesterday I watched a video on retrograde motion of Mars ~~mercury (and also sun)~~ again after a very long time. This time around I really wondered what it takes to observe such a motion. 

    a. First, curiosity of what's out there in the space; instead of just ignoring because it's been always there and can be seen everyday.

    b. Keep seeing one specific part of space, notice a specific object in the sky

    c. Identify the same object the next day

    d. Notice that that specific object has shifted it's position in fucking space and not a coordinate plane.  mean, you've got to have much more than a photographic memory to keep track of location of an object in space

   e. This comes before (d). The idea that I should keep track of it's location when you never knew it could move around/rotate/revolve.

    f. And the notice that the movement is strange. How many of us (in India) would do this in 21^st century? Apparently, this was observed by Greeks back in ~ 200 BC.
   
4. One auntie got mad at her husband/children and was screaming and shouting in no particular direction for a long time, even after they're gone. It seemed to stop at lunch time
5. I thought I should try making dosa using Chik Peas (Channa?) Yesterday I made batter and today morning I tried making dosas. It was a disaster. Was able to make just one dosa and it did taste dammed good. I am trying to make idli with the rest of the batter. It's work in progress.
6. All of a sudden Elpy mode is freezing my emacs. Need to find out why soon. I can't stand a monster memory guzzler Intellij.
7. Yesterday I bought 1KG really good tomatoes for 11 bucks.

I'll add any unremarkable, utterly boring, inconsequential events that I can recollect. Share your non-news and get back to your choice of slavery.",UUUU__UUUU," I overheard an old age aunty saying I love you to her husband. Made me smile.  After many many years, I just wandered around aimlessly on a two wheeler to explore surroundings last week. Found out there were 4-5 farms in 5km radius of my house, saw roads where they had good asphalt but nobody uses them, developed layouts with acres of empty land and a lot of cattle. It felt like a developed village with a dairy and old houses. There was a temple and outside a lot of old people sat to chat in the evening. I joined them and the chat went from their childhood stories to their oldage stories, their efforts and how you need to be a good person before a rich person.

It felt like I paused a day off my normal schedule and experienced something so small yet so beautiful.  Motu the dog barked for exactly 134 minutes straight last afternoon. Motu needs to stfu [deleted] A sweet Bhabhiji slipped down in the mud at bus stop yesterday morning. She was screaming at her son for being serious on exam day while the 7 year old bachcha was singing a song. I saw a dead cat yesterday. He was a stray but me and neighbours used to feed him.
RIP. Today morning I woke up  I am looking for a new job since people higher up the ladder blame the lowest pebble (me) for anything that goes wrong. My roommate got a job offer that pays more than his current manager's salary. We spent a while talking about the incompetent middle management at his current company and then went to the roof and had a few beers.

Also saw two kids popping wheelies on a beater 100cc bike. The second dude was almost hanging from the back in order to create enough leverage for the front wheel to stay up. I had deleted Ola app because of Rs.50 cancellation fee it slapped on me. But yesterday, I had to book Ola auto for my aunts. So, after a gap of almost 6 months, I re-installed Ola app and paid the damn fine (100 rupees) and booked Ola auto ride. [removed] After a long time, I went to skiing with my friends to Gulmarg. We stayed the night there and during sunset looking at those mighty Himalayas was one of the best sights I have seen till far by now.  A stray cat mom abandoned her 2 kitties in the building I stay. These kitties have settled to staying on the stairs and running up and down when someone uses the stairs. I ended up pitying them and kept milk and some cat food at my house doorsteps and they started to trust me. This was all cute and fun until they decided to play with our shoes, threw my nikes outside the building and shat all our entrance lol. Don't know how to respond to them now I am aiming to get my first job this summer. 
 After dropping my brother at the railway station yesterday, I went to the temple i used to go to every Tuesday with my mom. Felt good. Vultures are coming back. just saw 2 yesterday. such awesome birdies  Killer idea OP hope this becomes a thing (or a future website in which case HMU!)

A few days ago, my neighbour's plot caught fire. I thought it was intentionally done to clear the overgrowth. Such huge flames. I was cursing the mentality we have to use fire to clear our fields.

Later, I found out that the fire was accidental. However, the owner returned and found that since half the field was cleared, he might as well finish the job. Burned the rest off as well.

Supposedly, it's good for the soil and the ash can help the trees. What, 11 bucks for 1KG tomatoes? Its 20 bucks here.

Though I got 3 carrots and 2 small capsicums for 10 bucks, that was a good deal afaik.

 Man, now that you have mentioned donkeys, I don't remember seeing one in months :o.
Also, came across [this guy. ](https://i.imgur.com/oP180VO.jpg) Too fucking busy to notice anything other than desperation of elected officials

I saw more sign boards being posted on roadside in last week compared to last 5yrs.

MLA came to our society and asked if any work needs to be done

All roads r dug out because they r building new ones

A lot of dust on the road.

And not getting enough sleep, a family function this weekend so too busy I saw this and I like it. Quite relaxing to hear the small stuff that affects people. Puts into perspective the damage social media, 24x7 news, FOMO has done to us. A part of this world moves at lightning speed and another part moves leisurely. 1. Today, I finished my first ever new york times crossword after months and months of trying to do them. It was one of the greatest feelings and i celebrated by eating a vanilla ice cream. Had not had ice creams for ages before today afternoon.

2. There is a stray cat which roams around my building. I stay on the 5th floor. She comes up daily and just stares at me while i cook and clean. I want to adopt it but I am not entirely sure its a stray.

3. Yesterday, i saw house sparrows after A LONG LONG time. Decided to keep some grains of rice on my balcony. They have not noticed it yet. Hopefully, tomorrow. *Yesterday, I wanked all by myself...* Yesterday I learnt that my roommate has been a headache ever since and my flatmates actually want her out. 

I don't want to be a part of their petty war and it's been only 3 days since I moved out.

:/ Electricity department replaced a damaged light pole that was in middle of the street. The entire activity took about 3 hours with about 12 15 onlookers with special interest. By the way the truck bringing the new pole had a flat tire for no reason and had to be repaired. Visited my parents side of Hyderabad yesterday.

The constable who harassed my friends and I when we were younger has built a three story house with the bribes he collected. This is a gem of a thread. The saddest part is reading about the missing birds and animals. I am glad people are noticing. This should be a weekly thread

***Weekly Non-News of India*** The pig in my friend's backyard pooped lesser today Wow. Such a nice post. This should be weekly thing. Good going OP. :)

Also, yesterday, I finally picked up a pencil again after 2-3 weeks, to practice drawing. Not exactly yesterday (since I was traveling for the last 26 hours) but last week.

1. Visited Delhi for the first time. I've been to Delhi before but my time has always been spent either in the Metro or places close to the railway station.

2. Realized that a lot of the shops I used to eat at when I was a kid have been trying to modernize and have lost the old touch. I wanted to show off this old school shop where they made a big mug of lassi in a kulhad to my SO. However, the lassi doesn't taste the same anymore. Felt bad because it was an experience that I wanted to share but couldn't and that shop was a big part of my city experience growing up. My dad's phone got stolen some assholes snatch it off his hand. They were on a bike. Feelsbadman.

 Now I'll have to be careful too! Delhi ain't that safe even for men. :( Here is my non news: saw some post about an idiot talking garbage like he bought tomatoes for 11 bucks.

Seriously man WTF is this shit.",2019-02-22 17:50:19
AskIndia,"[AskIndia]South Indian Supporters of RSS, why do they believe in Hindutva?",25,awasht,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/awasht/askindiasouth_indian_supporters_of_rss_why_do/,101,"AFAIK Hindutva/RSS's idea of Nationalism stems from the European idea of Nationalism and not the Gandhian one. RSS hasn't adjusted its core ideology to be ethnically inclusive, instead it doubles down with Hindi as a National Language and a North Indian cultural soft power(TBF these issues always plagued the Central Govt but it feels like Hindutva ideology is adding jet fuel to the dormant embers of Hindi-Hindu Majoritarianism).

I find it baffling to see a lot of South Indians on Social Media vociferously supporting RSS. In a Hindi-Hindu Rastra they are ethnic minorities with second class status. And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India than they are towards non-Hindus. Which begs the question, why is there even a single South Indian Bhakt?

**On a Sidenote**: Has the Gandhian idea of India failed? Everything is so hyper&jingoistic these days. A mere mention of ethnic groups existing in India seems to trigger outrage&accusations of anti-nationalism. ",OmegaMaleX," South India is not a monolithic culture. 



Within TN post independence rationalist, and Tamil movements took root allowing little space for Hindutva politics of RSS or Hindu Mahasabha. Even congress's influence waned  after Kamaraj. DMK continued to propagate athiestic world view( unless electorally inconvenient) whereas AIADMK has always been ambivalent about religion. JJ was never overly athiestic. 

As rationalist politics and Tamil  pride politics got run  over by caste politics and welfare measures
, there are some pockets especially in the upper caste who want to wear their religion on their sleeves, and have also felt marginalized these many decades. Remember these were the 'villains'  in the Periyar and Anti caste movements. This minority is now turning towards hindutva.

 AIADMK becoming a BJP puppet, and  BJP's vast spending on PR and social media lends greater visibility as well.



Kerala is surprisingly conservative as a society. BJP has managed to infest a few pockets, and has piggy backed on the Sabarimala issue (after initially supporting entry of women). They have had  nearly no impact on electoral politics till now though.



Karnataka is the only state where BJP has been able to form a govt. 

Thing to note here is that unlike other southern states Karnataka was not administered as a single entity pre independence. Karnataka today is an amalgamation of Mysore kingdom, North Karnataka ( part of Bombay province) and other parts of Madras presidency. Though a common language and past empires ( Hoysala, Satavahana , Vijayanagar etc) united the territories within the state, a cohesive state consciousness and politics is yet to emerge in my opinion.  

Different parts of Karnataka have thier political heavyweights. Mysore region dominated by JD(S) with Congress second. NK Congress. Coastal Karnataka and Malnad is where BJP is strongest. In fact coastal areas have suffered from the poison of hatred filled saffron cultural goondaism ( remember Sri Ram Sene and the pink chaddi movement? ). 

Although there have been rationalist movements in the past, and rationalist literature has seen its hey  day, hindutva's appeal is mainly political except for pockets mentioned earlier. 

I have no clue about AP and TN Mainly because they only resonate with the ""Hindu"" part. To them Modi, RSS and bjp stand for ""Hindutva"" or ""Hinduism"" . Also a lot of the supporters mostly belong to upper caste Brahmins who feel Rss and BJP alone are a party worth voting for (never mind how they are actually treated) and see Congress as a ""non hindu/Muslim party"". [deleted] In South it's usually the upper castes who have this North culture(Hindi Sanskrit and cow) worshipping nature. For them native culture of their land is not their culture. If you ask some Tamil brahmins they will claim sanskrit is their mother tongue.

This also explains why Marathi brahmins have historically been pro Hindi and running the RSS instead of sticking to Marathi language.

How much this narrative affects the state politics is function of their population and influence.
That explains the clear irrelevance of this hindi-hindu ideology in TN and it's significance elsewhere  I think it's just hatred towards Muslims that drives them to RSS/hindutva.  Everyone votes based on caste lines. Even the upper caste people. Who will have a higher representation on social media.  [deleted] 1. Conversions and Other religions: By making them the strawmen.
2. Positive Image: Because they are projecting themselves as representatives/guardians of Hinduism. 
3. About Hindi: Local RSS functions in the local language but the love for Hindi comes from believing that English is not good for their culture. English education is how one becomes ""westernised"". They paint English as the destructive force. Gandhi kinda comes off as racist and undoubtedly casteist. He is a bad marker of moral behvaiour tbh.  [deleted] Wow, slow clap OP!

This discussion is petty at best. If anything, the RSS wants a United India, not a country further squabbling about who's from the North and what language they speak of. Nobody is imposing Hindi on South India, other than the imagination of people who are inherently racist. Believing that someone else is a racist makes the person a racist too. [removed] ""And the fact that many of the RSS leaders believed(still believe?) in Aryan/Dravidan dichotomy just cements this idea. I just don't see them being anymore inclusive towards South India""

Out of the loop on this. What has RSS said on Aryan/dravidian divide? Any references.  Faith and Country are two distinct things. History between the two religions has been pretty rough. One of them got the rough deal while the other got away easy and is now playing the victim. So this misappropriation will make every Hindu latch onto any organization that voices its support for them.  It's the TV. TV should have the same sort of warnings as on cigarette packs. A lot of southie right wing supporters are very badly educated if you look at it, the rest are clever and want to capitalize on a situation and extract some sort of political power from this stupidity.",2019-03-02 12:18:51

So did you mean to ask  ""**Mosquitoes make life a living hell in summer, but where do they disappear to when the weather gets colder?**"" :/ People who are saying that OP has got the situation reversed are wrong. I stay in Bengal and here we see more mosquitoes during Winter, especially in North Bengal. Whereas you don't see much mosquitoes during the summer.  In Mumbai, I feel it's the bad in summer. Okay in Winters. 

Advantage of living in small flats in Mumbai is that you have a lot of control over the air coming in (limited windows) and can easily eliminate mosquitoes. 

Downside is, crazy Hugh dengue rates. No Civic authority cares.  Oh, so this is where they migrate to in winter! My dude, you got it backwards. Winters are best because there's almost no mosquitos. 

They come back in the Summers but during Winters you will hardly notice any.  r/titlegore",2019-02-28 07:25:31

Business/Finance,I can't get over Shaktikanta Das being appointed as RBI Governor,347,a5ewag,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a5ewag/i_cant_get_over_shaktikanta_das_being_appointed/,116,"I flaired this as Business/Finance. I guess it should be Politics and Non Politics as well.

IAS officers generally have no technical knowledge of the area they lead. Now from RR, we have gone down to the level of this guy who raped us with his demo execution.

Now, does this guy have any formal education in finance and economics? I couldn't find out. Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit.

What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. We just don't have daily interaction with the RBI, so most don't know or care. RBI policies and actions affect everything. And I mean everything! As if demo isn't a good example of that.",badger991," It's very simple.

The only reason Urjit Patel, who offered no resistance to the government's draconian demonetisation move, flipped out when the government asked the RBI to loosen its reserves is even he realises how dangerous a move this is.

Jaitley is out there behaving like an ignorant child saying the RBI has 3 lakh crores of ""surplus"" when in actuality, it's ""reserves"". No one knows when the economy will go haywire.

The world's best economists didn't see the 2008 disaster coming. So these reserves are just that. Reserves!

And since Urjit didn't bend, the government kicked him out. You think this was a resignation? No, it was a firing that was timed to perfection.

The replacement was announced on election result day so it gets burried in the election news.

Mr. Das with his master's in history will offer nothing but support to the government's ideas.

Modi wants the reserves to come out, creating a temporary surge in growth. He will also announce a lot of people friendly schemes in run up the the 2019 Elections.

If these things happen, he truly will have fucked up the economy. I'm buying lube and preparing my anus. Demo 2.0 is right around the corner They got Das for one simple reason. For the ~~1 lakh~~ 3 lakh crore that Jaitley and gang are eyeing. 

The request for that money to be given from RBI reserve, will come in a week or two. 

In a month, there‚Äôll be more loans being dolled out by banks, more mudi kaka posters, more photo ops, more statues of mudi kaka himself if possible and Ofcourse, for ram mandir. 

These people will leave the country in ashes.  I have one request from all of you(people who understand beyond Mandir-Masjid, BJP-Cong). Start educating people on our parliamentary system about MLAs MPs start with your friends, your domestic help tell them how it is done, counsel them(not on which party to vote for but how it affects them). 

Let's start something from our side to save whatever we have left! [deleted] >What really worries me is that common people, or even educated people, or even the randia crowd don't seem to realize how serious and fucked up this could be. 

I hope the opposition takes to the social media and tells us what these people are up to. Most of us have a bare minimum education in matters of economics.  [removed] He's got a history degree and has no idea about the economics. He's a government yes man,a puppet.

The government wants to take a huge risk and damage the countries financial stability,in return for short term gains.

The movement of wealth from cash to bonds shows that this is just too risky Dude is MA History.  All his predecessors have been PhD in Economics and Banking.  He is just a Jately lapdog.   Why do you think Dr. Kurian didn't think highly of IAS folks, they are generalists not specialists. Das will help with the looting, this is their second attempt at demo to financially hamstring the opposition and slurp the RBI reserve. Our stewards have turned weak and spineless like Theoden. A reminder to everyone.  RBI asked PayTM to remove the CEO of Paytm payment bank because she did not have any banking experience. And now Jately ji has brought in a no banking experience/no economist(MA History) to head RBI. They think we are retarded. 

And to reply to another comment, these sarkari training certificates have no weight what so ever. I did an MBA from one of these Indian Institute tags and we train many a sarkari afsars usually IAS,IRS and IFS. They just have to attend a few sessions and they get the certificate. Getting a PhD from Yale or Harvard or MIT involves original research work. 

And on top of everything this dude implemented demonetisation.  No economist worth their salt would have let this happen.  I'm not worried if some person without some academic background gets appointed as the Governor of RBI as long as his actions are carefully considered and sane. Also, as other commenter pointed out, it's the board members who make the decisions collectively and we have experts from different fields of study in the board.

With all that said, it's still a very bad decision made by the government. I mean, it's not unexpected that they chose someone who supported the DeMon to the core despite its serious flaws. Also, his politically conservative attitude which he fearlessly displayed in the past is something that's troubling regarding his appointment. I'm supportive of people with very little or no academic background but with sufficient experience working in different related fields of relevance making it into key positions in apex level organizations but this man is clearly chosen with a different motive in mind.

As for the boards and its members being key decisions makers in the organization, I won't be surprised if they're to replaced with other like minded experts as our newly appointed governor if the present members show any kind of disappointment in the decision taking. No organization is devoid of factions but what we've seen till now is that these apex organizations were given a significant freedom to operate on those level of factions that were divided on academic grounds which is undeniably a healthy division. But the recent divisions that developed within the organization are toxic to this organization and thereby to the country as a whole because the core ideology is that of political, rather than being an economic or social one.

This appointment is very much like the appointment of Betsy DeVos as US secretary of education or Kavanaugh's appointment to the US Supreme Court. Abuse of power and unhealthy political involvement in matters that are unrelated. Let's see how this will unfold in times to come.  To me, it matters less what his academic or research credentials are. A lot of people with less formal credentials can do good jobs. What matters more is that he is a Government stooge. Totally agree with you. Mr Das has corruption allegations against him as well.  Pre 2014 RBI was eyeing implementation of basel norms, and now RBI itself is getting its ""pillars"" stripped üòë He was mouthpiece of government during demo. It's election time and government will try everything possible to remain in power.

RBI reserves will be used as election funds. Loan wievers, ect . Will there be any announcements or news once he hands over a part of the reserve to Mudi Kaka and Blog minister?  I dunno but I get the hunch that even this guy will not be able to tolerate the PM and his gang's nonsense and he will also leave.. Generally (historically) how much time the previous governments taken to decide on the next governer? Daru will help to get over someone üòÇ Nothing surprising saar. Inmates running the asylum is trademark of bjp Guys, he's an alumnus of IPE and has a masters in finance from there it seems. Just saying, not stating he's the guy for the job at all, cause he's not. ITT posters citing Wikipedia as source for Shaktikanta Das's qualifications. SMH vigorously.  tax payers are fcuked Why do you bring the rape analogy here! \>   Or are we just following 'hard work > Harvard' bull shit. 

I definitely do not agree with this. The Harvard passouts I have personally met so far have been bitter disappointments. Mostly because expectations from such people are high but also they are usually not experts in their fields or really intend to be. I dont have enough knowledge to say whether this is a good thing or not, But atleast his wikipedia page seem to indicate that he has done schooling in Finance in IIMB and National Institute of Banking Management. He also had held posts in various government revenue organizations.  Not sure, if these are good enough but i dont think they just appointed a guy with just MA History degree as RBI governor. He seems to have some relevant qualification and experience. He has experience in economics related field. PhD in economics doesn't means that you should be selected. Even Raghuram  pursued IIT and later did MBA. Did he had an economic background from the start? No.

This guy might not be the best option but let the guy even work. I know he is a puppet of the government but give some time at least. Turns out he does have a background in finance and management education as suggested by his Wikipedia page To be fair, RBI is supposed to serve the government. If urjit wasn't doing what the government was asking then they have the right to replace him. Because we will blame the government for poor economic policies and vote them out, not the RBI.

They're both Muslims from Hyderabad. 

One uncle married a Gujarati Hindu (she had to convert). The wife is a US citizen. Her family has businesses in Chicago and this guy inherited those too. They have two kids. As far as I know, their marriage works well enough. 

Another uncle married an American born daughter of Pakistani Muslim immigrants. She doesn't follow Islam and drinks alcohol, which this guy didn't like, but still went ahead with the marriage. She turned out to be very abusive. The guy was admitted twice to a hospital during the few years of their marriage. He has a son, so he's staying in the marriage for his sake. It's not unheard of when one partner is Indian origin person who got citizenship earlier. Infact, a close friend of mine got into an arranged marriage with a keralite girl with British citizenship and moved. It's probably more common among keralites though. They're experts in migration. I did it. My wife is actually an ex Victoria's Secret model as well. That seems to be one nasty way to emigrate. I believe women might have more chances than men.

Business/Finance,GST: Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials,21,7ohp21,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/firms-fret-over-raw-gst-officials-seek-to-get-them-changed/articleshow/62386197.cms,2,,madamplease," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Firms looking for a way to change their GST officials** 

 ______ 
A senior finance executive in a private equity firm was visibly worried after
he got a call from goods and services tax (

GST

) officer. The officer on the other end wanted to know more about the
construction business that the company was involved in. It took some time for
the executive to explain that the word ""stone"" in the brand name had nothing
to do with the business the firm was into.

Few kilometres away from the PE firm's office in

Mumbai

, the CFO of a finance company -- that's part of a major conglomerate -- was
nervous too. The CFO was just back from a meeting with the company's

GST assessing officer

, and it left him in knots.

""How does one explain credit

swap

ratio, private placement, and other debt instruments in Hindi?"" he asked his
chartered accountant who had accompanied him. The GST officer too had some
queries about some transactions that were carried out in the past few months.

As the government assigned GST assessing officers from a combined pool of
erstwhile Sales Tax, Excise and Value Added Tax (VAT) officers, many companies
are running scared. Earlier, state officers --mainly VAT -- only dealt with
manufacturing companies and service tax, and excise officials dealt with
service companies including banks, PE firms, NBFCs and insurance companies.

But under GST -- the common indirect tax -- that distinction has disappeared
and all officers now fall under one umbrella. So in several cases, erstwhile
VAT officials have been asked to assess PE firms, banks and finance companies.

Many of these firms are rushing to their tax consultants and desperately
asking them if they can in anyway change their assessing officers.

""There's no mechanism prescribed by the legislation that enables taxpayers to
voice their views on whether they would prefer being assessed by the existing
authorities.

Several service providers, whose business models are well known to the central
authorities and have now been assigned to the state authorities, are
apprehensive that the state authorities will take time to develop expertise on
taxation of services,"" said MS Mani, Partner, Deloitte

India

.

Industry trackers say that for indirect taxes, the importance of assessment
officers become crucial and dealing with them is not just an annual affair
like in the case of income tax. ""One has to deal with officials for refunds,
credits, monthly taxes, etc. The worry is many VAT officials will take some
time before they could understand nitty-gritty of our business,"" the senior
finance executive in the PE firm said.

The government has used a formula for allocation of assessment officers and
dividing work among central and state officers. And this is worrying not just
for PE firms or banks, but also some of the other traders.

Take the instance of an Indian shoe manufacturer that has a turnover of about
Rs 1,000 crore: the manufacturer has got a clean chit from the VAT officials
for the past five years, but is now worried about the heightened scrutiny.

Another diamond exporter based in Crawford Market in Mumbai has also sent out
an SOS to his tax advisors. The exporter, like the shoe manufacturer, wants
former state officers to assess his accounts, and not central officers.

The manufacturer has asked his tax advisors to figure out a way to change his
assessing officer back to what they were. Many say that these worries are
somewhat unfounded. ""Many companies have been approaching and making pleas of
changing their assessing officers, which is not possible. Every officer has
undergone training and there is no need to worry,"" a government official in
the know clarified.

""Most former VAT officials had until now dealt with indirect taxes on goods
and they would now be dealing with services. Although many of these officials
were given training, there would be a learning curve and this has worried
several services companies that have been assigned to state authorities,"" said
Sachin Menon, national head, indirect tax,

KPMG India

.

The worries may not be unfounded. Tax experts point out that indirect tax is a
complex subject. ""One of my clients, an IT firm, had received a notice because
the tax officer wanted a copy of an airfare receipt,"" he laughs. ""However, I
would say many officers would go easy on companies whose business models they
don't understand, and it may just be a good thing.""

But not everyone is convinced as some officers are already asking questions
which are making some companies jittery. Take the example of a law firm. The
tax officer wanted to know about each transaction leading to revenue of the
firm (although law firms are exempted from GST). The officer wanted to know
how come the head of the law firm was charging a fee of Rs 2 lakh for ""merely
talking for half an hour"" from a client, but not charging anything from
another client with whom she had spoken for two hours.

""It's not the law alone, the procedure of indirect taxes, especially GST, is
complex. It would have been great if officers who have no experience were
allotted smaller companies or firms for initial few years,"" a senior tax
advisor said.

  NEW DELHI: Apple wants the government to relax labelling rules so that it doesn't have to print product-related information directly onto devices to avoid cluttering up their minimalist design. That's one of the concessions Apple has sought after expressing its intention to start manufacturing in India, an official said.  

 

  The Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion (DIPP) forwarded the iPhone maker‚Äôs request to the Department of Revenue and Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeITY) in November for consideration, said another official. The company manufactures its products in six countries, with most being made in China.  

 

  

 

 

  Apple's distinctive design language is integral to product appeal and it strives to keep surfaces as free of artefacts as possible. The company wants to provide the product details that are required by law in India as part of the software of the device or on the packaging. The labelling issue will be dealt with by DeITY, the official said.  

 

  The company has also sought tax incentives that are being examined by the finance ministry. The government currently provides subsidies for investments in special economic zones in order to woo investors. Apple did not respond to queries.  

 

  The finance ministry had rejected an earlier proposal by Apple to set up wholly owned outlets in the country that sought exemption from the compulsory 30% local sourcing norm. The company had sought the exemption on the grounds that it was bringing ""state-of-the-art"" and ‚Äúcutting-edge technology,"" making it difficult to meet the sourcing condition.  

 

  During his visit to the country earlier this year, Apple CEO Tim Cook had said India was its next big market. PM Narendra Modi had urged Cook to set up factories to make its products in India.

Fitch Rating (Representational Image) Fitch Rating (Representational Image)

Despite a continued pitch from the government and corporates for an upgrade, global rating agency Fitch Ratings has kept its sovereign rating on India unchanged, citing weak public finances. In its latest rating review, Fitch acknowledged India‚Äôs strong growth and recent economic reforms but maintained that the state of the government‚Äôs finances do not justify an upgrade. Fitch affirmed India‚Äôs sovereign rating at BBB-, the lowest investment grade rating. The outlook on India‚Äôs rating remains stable, with the agency saying that upside and downside risks to the sovereign rating are broadly balanced.

India‚Äôs long-term foreign and local-currency issuer default ratings were also at ‚ÄòBBB-‚Äô. ‚ÄúIndia‚Äôs sovereign ratings balance a strong medium-term growth outlook and favourable external balances with a weak fiscal position and difficult business environment. However, the business environment is likely to gradually improve with the implementation and continued broadening of the government‚Äôs structural reform agenda,‚Äù it said. On Monday, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had said, ‚ÄúWhy is India, the fastest growing emerging economy for over one year now with all macroeconomic fundamentals being positive, rated just BBB-? On the other hand, Italy and Spain, which are far weaker and smaller, are having much higher ratings than us.‚Äù

‚ÄúItalian banks are in far worse shape than our banks. Italian government is more shaky and we have a solid political stability now,‚Äù he had said. According to Fitch, weak public finances continue to constrain India‚Äôs ratings, with a high general government debt burden of 67.9 per cent of GDP (‚ÄòBBB‚Äô median: 40.9 per cent) and wide fiscal balance of -6.6 per cent of GDP as estimated by Fitch for FY17. However, there are some early indications that fiscal policy might become more focussed on bringing down debt, it said.

Fitch said India‚Äôs economy is less developed on a number of structural metrics than many of its peers. Average per capita GDP remains low at $1,714, compared with the ‚ÄòBBB‚Äô range median of $9,701. Governance standards also remain weak, as illustrated by a low score for the World Bank governance indicator (46th percentile versus the ‚ÄòBBB‚Äô median of 58th percentile).

An official committee reviewing the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act has recommended lowering government debt to 60 per cent of GDP. ‚ÄúIt remains uncertain if the government will commit to the target suggested by the committee, but in his February 2017 budget speech, the finance minister explicitly recognised the low number of direct taxpayers, stating that India is ‚Äúlargely a tax non-compliant society‚Äù, which is a significant change in rhetoric. The central government‚Äôs FY18 budget also continues its gradual consolidation efforts irrespective of the difficult trade-off with the desire to spur infrastructure spending,‚Äù Fitch said.

‚ÄúSignificant contingent liabilities for the sovereign continue to emanate from public sector banks. The banking sector‚Äôs non-performing assets (NPAs) problem is well recognised by authorities, but continues to linger,‚Äù it said. Fitch expects NPAs to rise to 9.7 per cent of total loans by end-FY17, from 4.6 per cent in FY15, due mainly to stricter implementation of standards.

**Stand-up India: Key to developing entrepreneurs from underprivileged sections of society is¬†mentoring** 

 ______ 
Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India‚Äôs youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood.

Indian startups have captured global attention, attracted venture capital and achieved notable success in recent years. Such an effort if replicated at scale for underprivileged sections of society can have a catalytical impact on job generation in the country. While new entrepreneurship requires a supportive environment for finance and facilitative administrative procedures, creating large-scale entrepreneurship across the country additionally necessitates special measures for addressing capacity gaps among prospective entrepreneurs. Mentorship and effective links with financial institutions can play a key role in this endeavour.

Lacking sufficient employment opportunities, India‚Äôs youth are turning to small and micro enterprises for livelihood. According to the Sixth Economic Census conducted in 2013-14, there were about 58 million establishments in the country, employing some 130 million workers. Manufacturing, retail trade and livestock farming were the top three activities as per the Census. In addition, the shared economy fostered through online and telecom platforms too creates new opportunities for small and tiny businesses to generate rising income opportunities.

In the Bharatiya Yuva Shakti Trust (BYST), we have seen instructive examples of the impact that mentors can have on entrepreneurs from weaker sections of the society. Starting in 1992, BYST has helped establish 5,500 entrepreneurs through mentorship, creating about 2.5 lakh jobs. Tusshar Munoat from a poor farmer family of Maharashtra was identified as a potential entrepreneur, in one instance, and linked with a mentor who helped him to obtain finance for applying for government tenders in road construction. Munoat had maintained good accounting records and followed practices such as stock movement registers which made it easier to get the loan. With strict control on raw material quality and adherence to contractual conditions, he built lasting roads, providing employment to over 1,000 people from neighboring villages.

You may also like to watch:

Helping such young entrepreneurs convert their ideas into viable business enterprises under the guidance of mentors who double up as incubators for their new ventures can enable these job seekers become job creators. The new entrepreneurs need complete support and training, inspiration and networking and must be nurtured until they reach a level where they are not only self-sufficient, but in turn are able to do their bit for society by creating wealth and employment.

Mentors, too, should be selected carefully and trained with certification. Under the BYST program, each enterprise is assigned an individual mentor who provides personalised advice, tracks business growth and helps solve problems. Counselling and mentoring is needed right from product identification to scaling up and long-term growth.

Another example is of Bhaskar Tamuli from Assam, who wished to set up an enterprise to revive the traditional craft of bell metal. Lacking information on how to set up an enterprise, he needed counselling, training, and support to prepare the project report, and follow up with the financing bank. The designated mentor was able to work with Tamuli to obtain a loan and go on to maintain proper accounts, improve product design, link with markets lineage, manage employees, and conduct other essential business processes. This can have a cascading impact as well. Tamuli further encouraged 300 other persons to set up business, and is now considering exports. He has also ventured into training of local workers and has become a mentor himself.

Such handholding of entrepreneurs who lack the necessary knowledge is particularly important to encourage women entrepreneurship. Women face additional societal norms and family pressures which hinder their venturing into business. However, the micro-finance movement has demonstrated that they can be effective income-earners, given the right support.

Shanmugadevi Lakshmana Perumal conquered all odds to set up Swasti Support Services Pvt Ltd, which provides integrated facilities management services to corporates, IT Parks, hotels, etc. BYST helped in securing a loan from the Bharatiya Mahila Bank, Chennai. After the Chennai floods devastated her enterprise, more mentoring enabled her to stand on her feet again by launching a new brand logo, website and marketing collateral for ‚ÄòVivikura‚Äô. Another inspirational example is of Archana Parmathayalan who started a catering enterprise providing food for boys living in hostels.Her mentor helped her streamline the processes, improve efficiency, maintain financial records, and undertake financial forecasting, even obtaining ISO certification in the process.

We have found that the mentors too derive high personal satisfaction in voluntarily assisting entrepreneurs in building new livelihood opportunities. The mentors tend to remain in the program and take several new enterprises to successful maturity without expectation of returns. BYST has a cadre of over 4,500 mentors who devote time, energy and expertise to ensure success for entrepreneurs from weaker sections of society.

Under the Government‚Äôs MUDRA Yojana, Startup India and other programs, entrepreneurship creation is receiving the same policy attention as job generation. However, the lack of formal training and absence of information on how to set up a business hampers this effort. With a mass mentoring movement and spread of incubation to rural India, we could see a flowering of entrepreneurship at all levels.

**‚ÄòThe party will be over‚Äô: How GST‚Äâwill affect businesses that don‚Äôt pay tax** 

 ______ 
Rakesh Sachdeva sells auto parts in a busy market in central Delhi, just a few miles from Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs office. Yet despite having a flourishing business he does not pay any tax.

Until now, his rundown premises and small scale operation has kept the business below the radar of India‚Äôs tax officials. Come July 1, however, ‚Äúthe party will be over‚Äù, says the 51-year-old, with a resigned shrug.

A nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST), set to come into effect on Saturday, has faced criticism for its complex design. But the country‚Äôs biggest tax reform since independence is promising to bring millions of firms like Sachdeva‚Äôs into the tax net, boosting government revenues and India‚Äôs sovereign credit profile.

The new tax will require firms to upload their invoices every month to a portal that will match them with those of their suppliers or vendors.

Because a tax number is needed for a firm to claim a credit on the cost of its inputs, many companies are refusing to buy from unregistered businesses. Those who don‚Äôt sign up risk losing any customer who has.

‚ÄúI have no option, but to register with the new system,‚Äù said Sachdeva, who spoke to Reuters on condition the name and precise location of his shop were not disclosed.

Boosting the coffers

Improved tax compliance should shore up public finances, augmenting resources for welfare and development spending and giving a lift to the $2 trillion economy.

India currently has one of the worst tax-to-GDP ratios among major economies at 16.6%, less the half the 34 percent average for the members of the OECD and also below many emerging economies.

While there is no official estimate of the potential fiscal gain, some tax experts say the measure, after the initial teething trouble, would lift the tax-to-GDP ratio by as much as 4 percentage points as the number of tax filers is estimated to more than treble to 30 million.

‚ÄúIn future, compliance is going to be extremely crucial,‚Äù Rajiv Nair, chief executive officer at Kaya Ltd., told Reuters. ‚ÄúSince we are also responsible for compliance across the supply chain, we have to ensure that the suppliers we have are in a position to work with us in a compliant manner.‚Äù

Nair‚Äôs company, which makes beauty and personal care products, has just streamlined its supply chain, dropping vendors that were not going to be GST-compliant.

Other companies are doing the same. Elior Group, a French catering and food service company, said it has mandated GST-compliance as one of the eligibility criteria for its orders.

A REVAMP 17 YEARS IN THE MAKING India is all set to keep its July 1 date with the Goods and Services Tax (GST), a reform that has been in the making for 17 years. GST will unify India into one market place with one uniform tax, shore up government revenue and is expected to spur economic growth. Timeline of the long journey to GST rollout:

Winners and losers

The unorganised sector of India‚Äôs economy is vast, employing an estimated nine out of 10 workers.

While staying outside the GST regime risks losing business, joining it will necessitate an overhaul of firms‚Äô accounting systems and an investment in technology.

The new tax system requires three filing a month plus an annual return - a total of 37 filings - for each of India‚Äôs 29 states in which a firm operates. For smaller companies operating on wafer thin margins, hiring accountants and technical staff could substantially dent their bottom line.

Sanjiv Mehra, head of a traders‚Äô body in Delhi, reckons a ‚Äúprohibitive‚Äù cost could prove to be counterproductive.

‚ÄúCompliance is needed for input tax credit,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut what if you are in a business where margins are strong and allows you to forsake credit?‚Äù

But despite its flaws, many analysts think the new tax will be good news for bigger established businesses, because it will sweep away an array of federal and state sales taxes, levied at different stages of the supply chain, that often result in double taxation.

The government estimates the GST will save companies around $14 billion because it will allow them to organise their warehouses and supply chains more efficiently.

Firms can now move to demand-based ‚Äúhub-and-spoke‚Äù models used globally, rather than operating state-by-state.

‚ÄúThose companies which can wring out the maximum cost efficiency are the ones investors should bet on,‚Äù said Ajay Bodke, head of portfolio management services at financial firm Prabhudas Lilladher in Mumbai. ‚ÄúAll consumer-facing industries will be big beneficiaries of the GST.‚Äù

Didn't these firms have a sales tax number before?

Companies buying from them earlier would have surely shown whatever they purchased as expenses in their tax filing (I am not talking about tax credit, just expenses in a P & L statement). Now for showing these purchases as expenses, they would have needed a bill/receipt/invoice from these firms. For that these firms would need to have a Sales Tax Number.

**Au Small Finance Bank IPO; here‚Äôs what 8 brokerages say** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: AU Small Finance Bank is all set to hit the market with an initial public offering ( IPO ) on Wednesday. On offer are 53.42 million shares in the price band of Rs 355-358 apiece. The issue will close on Friday.The Jaipur-based company, which has got RBI licence to engage in small finance banking, has already commenced operations. With a network of 300 branches spread across Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Chhattisgarh, the lender used to serve across 10 states as a non-banking finance company ( NBFC ) ‚Äì AU Financiers ‚Äì before foraying into the small finance bank space.Here‚Äôs what brokerages said on the IPO:AU Small Finance Bank (AU SFB) is a small finance bank that recently transitioned from a retail-focused NBFC and primarily serves low and middle income individuals and businesses. Started in 1996, the company‚Äôs business primarily was focused on vehicle finance. The company later ventured into MSME and SME loans. AU SFB commenced business as a small finance bank on April 19, 2017. The transition to SFB has offered AU SFB significant growth potential and will help deliver improved performance and return ratios. At the upper band of the price band at Rs 358, the post-money valuation of AU SFB is at 5.3 times P/ABV FY17 of Rs 68, which we believe, leaves little scope for any upside in the near term. Hence we recommend investors to subscribe to the issue only with a long-term investment horizon.AU SFB‚Äôs gross AUM has grown at a CAGR of 30 per cent over FY13-17 on account of sectoral tail winds such as a financial inclusion drive and low credit penetration in certain areas of the country. These growth drivers are likely to persist over the longer term. As a result, AU SFB should continue its record high growth rate on its loan book.Further, AU SFB has successfully diversified its loan book composition that has helped it reduce concentration risk and improve asset quality. Out of the total loan book, 98.99 per cent is backed by revenue-generating assets. Also, LTVs of 80-85 per cent on showroom prices for vehicles loans and 40 per cent for MSME/SME loans are indicative of high-quality loan underwriting and risk management practices at AU SFB.Its initiation into housing finance and unsecured lending in FY18 should aid further diversification of the loan book. Given that the management has strong operational experience in housing finance and has an excellent track record of scaling up the same, we are confident that its initiation of housing finance will only add to profitable growth for AU SFB besides achieving diversification and risk management objectives. AU SFB has also displayed strong focus on optimising costs to keep profitability levels high. At the upper end of the price band of Rs 358, issue is priced at 5.1 times FY17 book value. Based on the management‚Äôs successful track-record of scaling up the business over the years, generating high returns (better RoAE than peers), focus on optimising costs, well-established framework for controlling asset quality and well-thought-out future expansion strategy, we recommend subscribe rating to long-term investors.In its earlier avatar as an NBFC, AU grew its gross loan assets and earnings at a robust CAGR of 34 per cent and 65 per cent, respectively, over FY14-17. The brisk AUM growth was complemented by its business diversity, both in terms of products and geographies. Profitability grew by leaps and bounds, notwithstanding persistent investments on the back of moderation in funding cost and firm control on product pricing.Post SFB launch, growth and profitability would be restricted; but the longer-run prospects seem bright. Its conversion into SFB will augment earnings diversity and stability. The IPO of 53.4 million shares is a 100 per cent offer for sale; with the promoters divesting 9 million shares after which they would bring down their holding to 33 per cent.At the upper end of the price band of Rs 355-358, the stock is being valued at 5.3 times FY17 P/ABV. In our view, this valuation, more than being palatable, offers a material upside post listing. We recommend a subscribe rating.While the trailing valuation of 5.1 times FY17 P/BV may look expensive after taking a first look, this is a unique model with no exact peers. An important distinguishing factor is that Au SFB is a small finance bank and can raise deposits to keep the cost of funds low, unlike its peers. Therefore, the SFB model should do better compared to the NBFC model in the long run.At the upper end of the price band, the company is valued at a P/BV of 5.1 times on FY17, which is relatively higher than the peer group NBFCs. However, given the consistent track record of AU delivering high growth, better RoAs with contained asset quality issues vs peers, AU commands a premium valuation. At the offered valuation, we recommend a subscribe rating on the issue with a long-term view.Given the strong presence in niche customer segments, AU SFB‚Äôs profitability will be remain superior to most conventional banks, said the brokerage. ‚ÄúDespite the migration to SFB, we estimate that AU will report trough RoEs of 17 per cent in FY18 this will recover to 20 per cent by FY20. This is significantly better than its listed peers which are currently reporting single digit RoEs. As such, valuations at 3.2 times book on FY20 are reasonable, and investors can expect strong upside over the next few years,‚Äù it said.Its evolution from a DSA of HDFC Bank to a significant retail lending NBFC and outstanding performance track record suggest AU SFB has the potential to emerge as one of the most successful SFBs in three to five years. ‚ÄúWe expect AU SFB to attract higher valuation premium compared to its peers led by sustainability of high growth in diversified business amid lower assets quality risk. At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, AU SFB‚Äôs market capitalisation would stand at Rs 102 billion, which gives it a price-to-book multiple of 5.1 times on March 2017 book value and P/E of 31.2 times on FY17 profit. We recommend subscribe rating to the issue, as it provides a favourable investment opportunity for long-term investors.At the upper end of the price band at Rs 358, the issue is offered at 5.1 times its FY2017 BV. However, AU has reported a strong 48 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2013-17. ‚ÄúWe believe it has the potential to deliver 30 per cent PAT CAGR over FY2017-19. Based on our quick estimates on FY2019 BV, the issue is offered at 3.5 times. While the issue is offered at premium valuations, we believe the valuation is justified given the historical track record and strong growth potential that SFB offers. We recommend subscribe rating on the issue,‚Äù the brokerage said.

**Regulatory reform fails to cut red tape: NITI Aayog** 

 ______ 
The survey conducted by NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country. Graphic: Mint

New Delhi: The big push by central and state governments to ease the regulatory environment notwithstanding, the perception of most business enterprises is that little has changed on the ground, a new survey has found.

The nationwide survey of the organized manufacturing sector was conducted jointly by the NITI Aayog and IDFC Institute, a Mumbai-based think tank, to monitor the business environment in the country. It surveyed 3,276 enterprises, including 141 early-stage firms, across 23 categories.

Not only do the survey results serve as a wake-up call to the government and a reminder that the legacy of red tape is far more difficult to undo than what has been thought so far, it also reveals that the experience of regulatory reform has not been uniform across the country.

The results released on Monday showed that for a majority of respondents, parameters such as setting up a business, land and construction, environment, labour, water and sanitation, taxes, and access to finance remained the same compared with a year ago; on legal matters, they reported that things had worsened. The survey was conducted in 2016.

To be sure, a little over a third of the respondents did say that there was an improvement in ease of doing business, while about a fifth said procedures had deteriorated.

While 38% of the enterprises said that the regulatory environment for setting up a business had improved, the same proportion claimed nothing had changed and 21% said it had worsened. A large proportion (44%) of the enterprises said the regulatory framework for getting environment clearances had stayed the same while only 17% said it had worsened. Around 36% of the enterprises said that legal processes for resolving disputes had worsened while only 25% said they had improved. About 46% of enterprises said that access to finance had stayed the same while 36% said it had improved.

The World Bank, in its Doing Business survey report released last year, offered a plausible explanation. ‚ÄúThe experience of implementing reforms based on doing business data has demonstrated to the government the significance of establishing clear stakeholder feedback mechanisms to close the gaps between policy formulation and implementation,‚Äù it said.

India‚Äôs ranking in the World Bank‚Äôs annual Doing Business survey improved by just one notch to 130 in its 2017 report from a revised rank of 131 last year. India is targeting a 40-notch jump in ranking in the upcoming survey, which is expected to be released in October.

The NITI Aayog-IDFC Institute survey also found that a substantial chunk of the enterprises surveyed were not aware of many of the improvements undertaken both by the Union and state governments.

On average, only about 20% of manufacturing start-ups were using the single-window facilities introduced by state governments for setting up a business. Even among experts, only 41% had any knowledge of the existence of these facilities. ‚ÄúTherefore, there is a clear need for creating greater awareness. In cases in which the lack of use is due to poor functioning of the service, the functioning must be improved,‚Äù the survey recommended.

Conceding that there was a communication gap, a person involved in overseeing the survey said that ‚Äúevery single company needs to be told about the changes taking place‚Äù.

Based on the results, the survey recommends more flexible labour laws to allow businesses to gain economies of scale. It also makes a strong case for states to open up their power distribution sector to private competition to lower costs and improve reliability.

Some analysts disagreed with the findings, claiming that the business climate has actually improved. ‚ÄúThe robust inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) despite volatile global macroeconomic situation reflects the overall improvement in ease of doing business in India,‚Äù said N.R. Bhanumurthy, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, a think tank.

FDI inflow in the April-June quarter jumped 37% to $10.7 billion compared with $7.6 billion received in the same period a year ago.

Commerce and industry minister Nirmala Sitharaman, who released the survey along with information and technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, said improving ease of doing business is getting the central government‚Äôs full attention.

Mumbai: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on Thursday relaxed the branch authorization policy, bringing all branches and fixed business correspondent outlets under the definition of banking outlets and removing restrictions on opening branches in Tier 1 centres.

According to the revised policy, RBI has defined ‚Äúa banking outlet‚Äù for a scheduled commercial, a payments bank or a small finance bank as a fixed point service delivery unit, manned by either the bank‚Äôs staff or its business correspondent, where services of acceptance of deposits, encashment of cheques, cash withdrawal or lending of money are provided for a minimum of 4 hours per day for at least five days a week‚Äù. Those outlets which do not meet this criteria will be called ‚Äúpart-time banking outlet.‚Äù

While the policy has removed restrictions on opening banking outlets in Tier 1 to Tier 6 centres without taking RBI‚Äôs permission in each case, the regulator has mandated that banks open 25% of these outlets in unbanked rural centres (URC). Under the revised policy, a URC is defined as a ‚Äúrural (Tier 5 and 6) centre that does not have a core banking system (CBS)-enabled ‚Äòbanking outlet‚Äô of a scheduled commercial bank, a small finance bank, a payment bank or a regional rural bank nor a branch of local area bank or licensed co-operative bank for carrying out customer based banking transactions‚Äù.

With the expansion in definition of a branch, RBI has allowed all extension counters, satellite offices, part-shifted branches, ultra small branches and specialized branches, to be treated as ‚Äòbanking outlets‚Äô or ‚Äòpart-time banking outlets‚Äô. However, ATMs, E-lobbies, bunch note acceptor machines ,cash deposit machines, e- kiosks and mobile branches will fall outside the purview of ‚Äúbanking outlets‚Äù. This is a shift from the earlier definition of a ‚Äúbranch‚Äù which also included off-site ATMs.

The proposal to rationalise the branch authorization policy was introduced under former RBI governor Raghuram Rajan in the April 2016 monetary policy. ‚ÄúWith a view to facilitating financial inclusion and providing flexibility on the choice of delivery channel, it is proposed to redefine branches and permissible methods of outreach, keeping in mind the various attributes of the banks and the types of services that are sought to be provided,‚Äù RBI had said in the policy statement.

Later an internal working group was set up, which came out with the draft report in October 2016. The key focus of the recommendations was to facilitate financial inclusion by ensuring availability of banking services in all centers through low-cost delivery channels.

The revised policy has also allowed small finance banks three years from the date of commencement of business to align their banking network with the extant guidelines. Till such time, the existing structures may continue and would be treated as ‚Äúbanking outlets‚Äù though not immediately reckoning for the 25% norm. ‚ÄúNevertheless, during this period of three years, for all the banking outlets opened or converted from the existing MFI branches in a year, they will have to open 25% banking outlets in unbanked rural centres in the same year,‚Äù RBI said.

‚ÄúThis policy will help in further penetration in rural areas and increase the profitability of the organization. We expect 10-15% more growth in the business with same set of branches we have projected,‚Äù said Munish Jain, chief operating officer of Capital Small Finance Bank.

If you want results from only one newspaper put that newspaper's name also in the search along with your search query. Or go to the newspaper site and search there.

Come over to /r/indiainvestments and ask your question. We will try to help you.

I appreciate OP who wants to learn all he can. To all other users who feel they are similar to OP, you can do this two ways:  
1. Crib and complain you don't know anything  
2. Take the initiative, start learning yourself.

Khan Academy's links to understanding basic money concepts: https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance


Edited to add: Read the big financial newspapers in the country: Economic Times, Business Standard, Financial Express, The Hindu Business Line. All have decent websites. XI and XII class ki business studies and economics ki book padh lo. if you are interested in learning all aspects of personal finance then visit the faq section of /r/IndiaInvestments 

Also check the articles on sites like www.jagoinvestor.com

They also offer services http://www.jagoinvestor.com/services which are more of educating you rather than providing a off the shelf service
 On a serious note, whether we learn German or Sanskrit, some of the basic finance topics consumer banking, tax, investments should be taught in schools or colleges so as to not get ripped.

Let girls alone, guys don't know enough about these things. And, things are complicated and I would want FM to simplify these things.  Try coursera.org for a free online course on Macro Economics. Try to correlate what you are learning with stuff in the newspapers. Also go to a CA and file your tax yourself with him helping you. The more you do stuff on your own, the more it'll make sense... its not that hard, just a bit daunting. Khan academy

not really indian context, but overall good resource for Finance/Banking 101 So disappointed with this thread! Really thought I'll get better answers than taking courses and reading textbooks. 

I feel the same way as you OP. I just don't know how to manage money and my biggest nightmare is that someone will cheat me out of it because I am too naive. Currently I get more than 5 calls per week asking me to invest in FDs at my bank. I have no idea about interest rates, I didnt even know my current balance earns an interest. I'd like some ""smart"" folk here to explain where I could invest my savings in a super simple but efficient way. I aint got no time to read my high school economics textbooks again. Seriously I don't remember a thing although I aced it. ;)

Recently I had to file taxes at my company and realised my parents have manipulated my name in not having a single thing to claim tax. I just sat down and wondered wtf is happening. Needless to say I couldn't claim. I have a pan card but it was handed to me by my dad who got it all done. So no fucking idea what happened there. 

I request someone here to tell me brielfly about things I discussed. (no links) thankyou! Search for business insider 25 most useful websites.1 site among that list teaches finance. Also add Taxation ,shares ,investment etc :) TTC lectures money and banking(paid)


Khan academy > To be more clear, I am a medical student

Consider finances and investing as a complex system (like the human body). Like for a healthy life, you don't *need* to understand the intricacies of the workings of the human body, similarly for good financial management and investing, you don't need to understand how and why of all those changes. 

> I don't know how or why the rates of oil, gold and the value of money changes, 

Most people, including investors, don't understand the reasons of those either. Don't go by the financial news networks explanations ex post facto. 

For the modern monetary system working, check out [this research article](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1905625). This is posted in terms of the US system, but applies on India too. 

> how the bank works 

Banks take money from the depositors (as money in the savings and current accounts, FD, etc) and lend them to those who need it. In the middle of this, they have their margin. Eg, the highest FD rates would be 8-9% while the lowest lending rates would be 11-13% (so the gap of 3-4% is their profit margin). This is the most basic idea.

**Banks wary of Modi government's merger plan for fear of loss of brand name** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: The government is looking at consolidation of at least two state-run banks in this financial year, but some of the lenders identified for merger or takeover by bigger entities have expressed serious reservations on their identities being subsumed in the process.The target banks are keen that their names survive the consolidation and they continue to have a strong role in business operations, officials said. Earlier this year, four state-run banks ‚Äì Syndicate Bank, Canara Bank, Vijaya Bank and Dena Bank ‚Äì made presentations to the finance ministry on their consolidation plans.‚ÄúWe have worked out some combinations. This involves a larger bank taking over two smaller entities.Also, there is a case for merging two smaller but strong banks. We can look at some hybrid names which retain characters of the both banks,‚Äù said a government official, who did not wish to be identified.The official cited the case of the merger between Centurion Bank and Bank of Punjab that led to the creation of a new entity, Centurion Bank of Punjab, which later merged with HDFC Bank in 2008.Senior executives of the banks being considered for consolidation have told the finance ministry that the brand names of the lenders have deep-rooted association with their borrowers and the loss of brand names could potentially affect business. Vijaya Bank, for instance, was set up in 1931. Syndicate Bank, set up in 1925, was earlier known as Canara Industrial and Banking Syndicate Ltd.Experts, however, said the merger exercise should not be delayed only because of brand issues.‚ÄúThese are state-run lenders. The borrowers are aware of this and there is no possibility of losing business just because a lender reinvented its brand name,‚Äù said MP Shorawala, a former independent director with Central Bank of India. ‚ÄúWe already have a successful example in case of Axis Bank.‚ÄùIn 2007, UTI Bank rechristened itself as Axis Bank. ‚ÄúThe idea was to get a grasp on the issues which could come up during the merger exercise,‚Äù the official cited earlier said, adding that some of the factors taken into consideration for merger are the business mix, the information technology platform that the banks are operating on and the geographical spread.In April, State Bank of India absorbed five of its associate lenders and Bharatiya Mahila Bank, creating a larger bank that accounts for a quarter of all outstanding loans. There are 21 state-run banks in India.In June, after reviewing the quarterly performance of public sector banks, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the government was ‚Äúactively working‚Äù towards consolidation but did not share any details, stating this was price-sensitive information.The government is also undertaking a simultaneous exercise to assess the capital requirements of state-run banks. ‚ÄúWe are waiting for the first quarter results.Once that happens, we will allocate further capital based on their requirements,‚Äù Jaitley had said at the time.While the government has already allocated Rs 8,000 crore ‚Äî the spillover from the previous fiscal, this year, it plans to provide another Rs 10,000 crore by way of capital infusion.

The Indian pharmaceutical and healthcare industry has long been dominated by men, a trait it shares with many of its counterparts abroad. But now a big change is sweeping across this immensely technical and challenging business landscape. A new crop of women business leaders has emerged at the top, coming up with game-changing ideas and services in some of India's top pharma and healthcare companies. Their business acumen apart, these women have added tremendous value in shaping their organisations.
 
 They are reinventing age-old practices and promoting diversity to meet challenges and take their companies to the top. Some like Ameera Shah of Metropolis have built the business from scratch while others like Samina Vaziralli of Cipla have been handed the reins of a 75-year-old company. But whether it is building businesses or wading through troubled waters, they have proved their mettle. They are young, but have come of age quickly. They are not afraid of taking business risks or foraying into newer businesses. They have embedded a culture of inclusive environment and pushed for HR reforms targetted at women in the DNA of their companies ‚Äî who better than them to understand the struggles of juggling family and business. These are their stories.
 
 Our systems have kept pace with growth: Namita Thapar 39 CFO, Emcure Pharmaceuticals
 Key Accomplishment: Expanding global footprint and making five global acquisitions in the past 3-4 year
 Key Challenge: Managing work-life balance. Having to earn the respect from peers who judge her as someone born with a silver spoon 
 
 In 2006, five years after she completed her MBA from Duke University's Fuqua School of Business, Namita Thapar got a call from her father Satish Mehta, promoter and CEO of Emcure Pharmaceuticals, to join the family business in Pune. Thapar, a CA by qualification was then working in the healthcare sector in the US ‚Äî for Glaxo and Guidant (now Abbott) in various finance roles. Emcure had by then received funding from private equity fund Blackstone and had aggressive plans to enter the US market. Mehta felt that with his daughter's US education and experience in the healthcare sector would add value to the business. He persuaded her and her husband to move back to India.
 
 The move paid off. Emcure is one of the fastest growing pharmaceutical companies in India on account of launch of innovative formulations developed by its R&D and marketing strategies designed to build brands. In the last 10 years, it has grown from a Rs 500 crore company to a Rs 4,500 crore entity. ""I can't take all the credit as my brother Samit and husband Vik have added tremendous value too, but believe I have made some good changes based on my experience in the US. All three of us got a lot of autonomy from my father to make changes,"" says Thapar.
 
 Emcure has made five large global acquisitions in the past three years. As CFO, Thapar and her team assisted the M&A team in those deals. ""These strategic acquisitions have significantly expanded our global footprint,"" says Thapar.
 
 At Emcure, Thapar has brought more automation in finance, was closely involved with domestic marketing and helped make meetings more data driven (especially through sales force automation). She also worked with HR to improve critical systems such as appraisal, variable compensation and talent identification. ""I am a strong believer that as a company scales, it needs to become more process driven and develop leadership bandwidth,"" she adds.
 
 Thapar says there are plenty of reasons for more women to join the pharma sector. Functions like quality, finance, marketing, IT, regulatory are great areas for women to work, according to her.
 
 She has launched a program called ""Prerna"" aimed at increasing the representation of women in the company, which has doubled to 20 per cent in the past four years. Emcure has several women in leadership roles in quality, regulatory, marketing, IT, HR and finance, says Thapar.

Business/Finance,Should I get an MBA? [NP],4,3ewrql,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/3ewrql/should_i_get_an_mba_np/,9,"Currently, I am a undergrad student majoring in Finance in Thailand. I will be done in December. I haven‚Äôt done 10+2 ‚Äì> only did the IGCSEs. My dad runs a jewellery business which I will join if I do not go for Masters. I have no prior knowledge about the business and I will move to India to train myself (it has been taken care of).

I am considering an option and would like an opinion on this matter. I was thinking that while I learn my family business under someone else‚Äôs guidance, I also prepare myself for CFA. Since I am already a Finance undergrad, I will be furthering my studies in my field of interest. This would mean I can learn about how to handle a business and earn a CFA (provided I pass). But this would also mean boycotting the MBA.

Also, maybe pursue a Gemological Institute of America (GIA) course at some point ‚Äì although unlikely.

How do you think of my plan? Will it be wise to not pursue MBA? I am uncertain if this is the right way to go and would love to have opinions. ",nosleepnomore," I think your best option would be to opt for an MBA overseas.  If you want to expand your business, work with your dad and join an entrepreneur/Family Business oriented MBA/PGP program. For example, ISB has one http://www.isb.edu/management-programme-for-family-business.

 IMHO, you should go ahead with the MBA. Reasons:

1. It would give you the skillset and network needed to successfully run your dad's business, esp considering that you do not have work ex so far.

2. Even if you plan to stick with finance with the CFA, the MBA will still be a value add as it is highly regarded in finance companies.

A word of advice: Aim high, don't compromise on college because of the high fees. It's not like undergrad, where you can sit in your room at night and catch up on studies even if your profs are no good. In an MBA brand value and peer learning are important. Plus a top tier programme will provide enough return on investment to justify taking an education loan. Instead of CFA or MBA, why don't you try other finance courses too? You can learn with industry experts at Imarticus Learning. They even have placement options, if that is something you are interested in. Visit their website: www.imarticus.org .. They also offer online courses in case you want that flexibility.",2015-07-29 05:12:50

Blockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services. Photo: Reuters

Mumbai: The Mahindra Group and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) will co-develop a blockchain solution, which the companies claim, has the potential to reinvent supply chain finance across India by enhancing security, transparency and operational processes.

This cloud-based application, one of the first projects of its kind in India outside of traditional banking, is designed to transform supplier-to-manufacturer trade finance transactions, Mahindra said in a statement.

The blockchain-based supply chain finance solution will enable all parties involved in the transaction to act on the same shared ledger, with each party updating only its part of the process, ensuring efficiency, consistency, trust and transparency, while safeguarding sensitive information.

Invoice discounting, the process of bundling and selling invoices at a discount, is a major source of working capital finance for many suppliers. This new solution aims to enable more suppliers to access credit, with the goal of driving more financial inclusion throughout the supply chain. The solution aims to simplify supplier-to-manufacturer invoice discounting processes that have historically been difficult, slow and risky, requiring each party to maintain and manually update separate ledgers.

Anish Shah, group president (strategy), Mahindra Group, said the group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth.

The company is also actively looking at other applications across the group in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. ‚ÄúThis proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance‚Äôs small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. Working with IBM, we will work to build, test, scale and refine this solution over time,‚Äù said Shah.

Blockchain technology can help enable Mahindra Finance access transactions recorded on a shared ledger in near real-time, enabling it to develop and offer new products to small and mid-sized enterprises. This is a radical process and technology shift which has the potential to drive business growth into the future.

‚ÄúBlockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did,‚Äù said Lula Mohanty, managing partner of IBM Global Business Services.

The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, ‚Äúand we‚Äôre confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well,‚Äù he said.

In an interview with Mint in June 2016, Shah said Mahindra is sharpening its focus on digital technologies such as blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT), and even augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), to boost growth.

> * Chief Economic Advisor (CEA) Arvind Subramanian has suggested Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley to radically alter India's climate-change policy and negotiation strategy before the new global climate-change agreement, to be finalised in Paris by December this year.In a note to the two ministers - which has been reviewed by Business Standard - Subramanian has recommended that India should stop insisting that the developed countries provide financing for poor countries to fight climate change, as they are required to under the UN climate convention.The chief economic advisor has said India should align with coal-rich countries and distance itself from poor and developing countries, as well as existing allies like China, those in the BASIC grouping, other 'like-minded developing countries', and BRICS, for the coming climate change negotiations in Paris.He has advised that India stop focusing on adaptation to meet the inevitable threats of climate change on the poor and, instead, do more to reduce its own emission.

> * He has also suggested that India stop insisting that the current way of differentiating in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change between rich and developing countries - called annexures - be retained in future.Subramanian has warned that India should not trust China, even as the latter has formally insisted at the talks that this firewall be retained.So far, India's stance on climate-change negotiations has consistently been just the opposite, for years.

> * The present note elaborates the same observations, and additionally gives specific recommendations to the prime minister and finance minister on how India's goals, strategy and actions for the Paris talks should change.These recommendations, if accepted, will entail a complete overhaul of India's long-standing policy on climate change, internationally as well as domestically.

> * ""Seeking climate change financing, retaining the distinction between Annexe I (developed) and non-Annexe I (developing) countries, and emphasising on adaptation"" he has listed as ""less vital interests"" of the country.In a paragraph on why India should not demand climate change finance from rich countries, Subramanian has asked: ""Are the commitments of cash-strapped advanced countries plausible?

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation. Photo: Mint

New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs crackdown on the cash economy has shattered the consensus needed for a new national sales tax, plunging his boldest reform into limbo and threatening to entrench an economic slowdown.

Modi‚Äôs government already had its work cut out to finalise a deal with India‚Äôs 29 federal states to launch a goods and services tax (GST) on 1 April that would transform Asia‚Äôs third-largest economy into a single market for the first time.

But his decision to scrap 86% of the cash in circulation, in a bid to purge the economy of ‚Äúblack money‚Äù, has caused huge disruption.

A slump in business activity stemming from the cash crunch has caused the revenue of state governments, which collect value-added tax on goods and other duties, to slump by 25-40%.

The states won‚Äôt risk another setback by rushing the sales tax into force.

‚ÄúThe investment and economic environment in the country is in bad shape,‚Äù said West Bengal finance minister Amit Mitra, who earlier head a panel tasked with building a consensus on the GST. ‚ÄúHow is the country going to absorb the dual shock of GST and demonetisation?‚Äù

The GST is India‚Äôs biggest tax overhaul since independence in 1947. It would replace a plethora of federal and state levies with one tax, easing compliance, broadening the revenue base and boosting productivity.

It took Modi more than two years to forge a political compromise on the tax in August. Now, demonetisation ‚Äúhas created a trust deficit,‚Äù said Kerala finance minister TM Thomas Isaac. ‚ÄúAfter this, I am not going to sit and compromise. They don‚Äôt deserve it.‚Äù

Left in the lurch

Failure to break the deadlock could tip India into a fiscal crisis: The GST would need to come into effect by mid-September, when the old system of indirect taxation is due to lapse. The lingering uncertainty is worrying companies needing to understand financial implications of the new tax.

‚ÄúWith so many vital details still missing, they are feeling left in the lurch,‚Äù said Saloni Roy, a senior director at Deloitte.

Modi‚Äôs shock move last month to scrap Rs500 and Rs1,000 notes was aimed at India‚Äôs shadow economy. But the ensuing cash crunch has caused job losses, disrupted supply chains and slowed construction activity.

With cash shortages showing no signs of abating, some economists are calling for emergency stimulus to cushion the economy against the impact of demonetisation.

Ambit Capital, a Mumbai brokerage, forecasts growth this fiscal year will be only half of the roughly 7% level many expect. The Reserve Bank of India has shaved its growth outlook by half a percentage point to 7.1%.

To make up for their losses, states are seeking compensation and will press their case at a meeting in New Delhi on Thursday and Friday with finance minister Arun Jaitley.

He has already agreed to cover states‚Äô revenue losses for five years after the GST‚Äôs launch, but further concessions would narrow his room for manoeuvre in his annual budget presented in February.

One top finance ministry official dismissed demands for compensation for demonetisation as unreasonable. But states are adamant. ‚ÄúThey have brought it upon us,‚Äù V. Narayanasamy, chief minister of Puducherry, told Reuters. ‚ÄúNow they must pay for our loss.‚Äù

Counting costs

The quibble is not just over lost revenue. Some states worry about the social and political costs of demonetisation.

Take Kerala, where credit cooperatives that farmers and retired government workers rely on cannot swap old bills or issue fresh notes. The state alleges this has encouraged commercial banks to scout for their deposits, sparking a ‚Äúrun‚Äù on them.

Odisha‚Äôs chief minister has written to Modi, saying curbs imposed on primary agriculture societies were making it difficult for farmers to access crop loans and procurement payments.

With the states smarting, they have hardened their stance on how to collect the new GST, which will have federal and state elements.

They want sole control over businesses with annual turnover of Rs15 million ($220,000) and so-called ‚Äúdual control‚Äù over bigger firms. Jaitley opposes this, fearing tax collectors could end up at cross purposes.

‚ÄúWe reached this far because states were willing to compromise,‚Äù said Isaac, Kerala‚Äôs finance minister, told Reuters. ‚ÄúIf they want the GST, they will have to now concede to the states.‚Äù Reuters

So my question is how good is ISBF, Delhi? Apparently, it's affiliated with University of London, with ""academic direction"" from London School of Economics. I'm not too sure about this as this is literally the first time I'm hearing about this institution (pardon my ignorance). I couldn't find much about it on other websites, either. I'm looking at a BBA (or a BSc in Business & Management in ISBF's case) from either Symbiosis, Pune or NMIMS, Mumbai. 

I have the option to go abroad, but I honestly doubt if it's worth spending 80L+ when I could get a similar degree in about 10L. Of course, the knowledge and exposure I'd get would be tremendous and I'd get a better pay as a fresher, but I doubt it's worth the extra $$$.

What do you guys feel? Thanks :D",fiftycabbages," >ISBF delhi 

Lel apne moolchand vala college. This place is small but I have heard many people go there. They sent you in your final year to London which is quite good although many other universities have this program too. 

>symbiosis pune

Get ready to smoke weed everyday. You name the type of weed you want. Like Bhasin or a little kerela gold and they got you covered. If you are planning to live in a hostel get ready to get high. Peer pressure is unbelieveable 

Tip - share munchies, jaldi dost bnege. Academics sucks there. 

>mims mumbai

Lund college hai, ek Chota sa 7th floor hai bas. No fucking campus 

And fees is retardedly high. Students ki gaand maarte hai college mein. It's a strict school. Placements are quite good here though.  NMIMS would be the way to go in my opinion.  If you can go abroad, give it a try. 

Only, beware of the fact that one year master's programme from UK won't be recognised if you return to India.  Unless you are loaded don't go abroad for undergrad. Just not worth it. Study in India and go for Master's later. What's your current age? Acha ji. Well tbh I did my college around ten years ago, things have clearly changed since then.

Is there any leased line provider backed a SLA guarantee? I'm based in Hyderabad. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!,wildgoat," Get at least 2 lines from completely different and independent ISPs like Tata, Rcom, Airtel, Vodafone.

Most leased Internet connections come with a SLA. BUT, the SLA doesn't itself guarantee the up time. If there is a downtime, the provider will simply pay the penalties but your business will be hurt severely.

Make sure to discuss with them your needs of very high up time and get 2 different drops on one line or a backup fixed wireless link.

With two ISP which have there own backhual that takes data out of India like Tata/Rcom/Vodafone, and two lines from each you can pretty much give you 100% uptime. I am setting up a finance based business currently and am going to use airtel for leased line. They say they guarantee no downtime.

What you setting up from the look of it a sub broker or an HFT . Is it an HFT? haha, There was some add for a colocation service in front of the fort starbucks a while back. Sadly, I don't remember the name of the firm. It exists, and perhaps that will help you find it.

Also, what the heck do you plan to do? Is it whats usually within the intersect of super low latencies, finance, computing and programming?

Government is thanking tax payers. That's not enough, they have to return by pushing for more tax enforcement for tax evaders which will reduce the burden overall bringing down the tax rates. In other news, government recently proposed a bailout of 100,000 crores for bsnl / mtnl.

)"". 

I had earlier speculated over the radical language in the economic survey implying a clear break from the past and this symbolism increases that. Let's see if the budget follows through on all this language. That speaker's smile is creepy! The budget's fiscal deficit calculation of 3.3% for 2019-2020 (Estimated) is based on the indian economy growing by 12 % over this year ! 

&#x200B;

""GDP for BE 2019-2020 has been projected at 21100607 crore assuming 12.0 % growth over the estimated GDP of \`18840731 crore for 2018-2019 (RE)"" 

\-Footnote page 3 of [Budget at a glance](https://www.indiabudget.gov.in/doc/Budget_at_Glance/bag1.pdf)

Edit : I know its the nominal figure, but it is calculated on the basis of inflation target of 4 % which in turn depends on the success of RBI and Govt policy in reviving industrial growth in the country. 8% real growth is still a massive challenge and using an inflated figure to claim that fiscal deficit will be brought down to 3.3% of estimated gdp figure for 2019-20 still implies that the fiscal deficit will rise in rupee term.

Awesome. The budget lacked action. It had few proposals but majority of it was creating a vision for India. No big schemes or proposals So for people who want a comparison of how this budget is VS something from the MMS team, here‚Äôs chidabaram presenting the 2007 budget - http://www.moneycontrol.com/budget2007/pre_budget/Union%20Budget%202004-05.pdf?classic=true

I find that while he also says ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a plan for that‚Äù, he backed up more of his ideas with mechanisms of actions, cut offs to identify target groups, and specific budget allocations - at least compared to what I have seen so far by 12:10 IST. 

Let‚Äôs see how things change, and hope to be pleasantly surprised.

Edit: at least the banking section is more on the ball. However I‚Äôm not sure how RBI power over NBFCs is going to fix it?

Edit: hahaha! It‚Äôs here! Debt raising!! This is the govt of spend (not a bad thing provided it‚Äôs accretive) 


What It‚Äôs now time for our citizens duties! Is our duty to make sure we get the bang for our buck? 

Ok time for taxes.

Edit: Republican Party of India. Spend more, tax less, take on more debt, and reduce the fiscal deficit. 

Frankly, given the mess we have, even that contradictory plan is not bad. Government spending is now a major part of our teetering economy. At least that‚Äôs keeping the infra side of our economy thriving.

However someone has to pay, and with lower taxes, taking loans is the other option.

Edit: the tax credit on interest is Decent. Doesn't budget usually takes place around February, why now?

Why is the minister speaking like this is an election campaign? Is every budget like this? Economic survey showed that rajasthan which relaxed the draconian labor laws generated about 25% more jobs than other states.

The current labor laws force small scale companies to not hire more than 99 employees.

This is because, as soon as you reach 100 employees, a large number of government laws and regulations come into effect.

This has caused small companies to not have any incentive to increase in size and take advantage of scaling to reduce costs Wow their arms are going to break with all the patting their own backs.

Literally zero hard numbers so far. This is disappointing in its predictability. What time (IST) will it start? What all reforms are you expecting? I‚Äôm expecting this budget to be something exciting this time. Will sadhvi also contribute to Gandhipedia which the minister is taking about? Did I miss the memo about Lord Basaveshwara?

Business/Finance,In need of urgent advice regarding career! Please help.,14,czff99,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/czff99/in_need_of_urgent_advice_regarding_career_please/,4,"Hi,

I am a 25 year old Indian national living in Thailand with my family. I did my undergrad in Thailand in BBA in Finance. After that I joined my family trading business of loose diamonds. After a year in the business, I joined a Thailand based diamond jewelry export company (owned by an Indian-American). 

I am working in the jewelry company for the past two years but since I am the youngest I am given odd works. I am being paid 55,000 baht per month (after tax). 

I was wondering what my options for a secure future are? I am starting to get complacent in my job - getting comfortable with my monthly salary which I do not want. If I get fired or if I want to switch my job, I do not feel I have enough skills to get an equivalent salary. 

Another issue is that the jewelry industry is shrinking. I am also not sure if I enjoy the industry as much. I have a few options in mind but opinions are needed. My options are -
1. CFA
2. MBA
3. Starting a business

I am so confused in life about my career that I hate even thinking about it. My work timings are 8:30 am to 6:30 pm (Mon-Fri). Saturdays I work 8:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I have around 10 lakh baht saved since I live with my family. But we do not have any asset - no house, car, etc.

Please help.

Edit - For MBA, I would love to go to the Western countries or India - wouldn't do it in Thailand. I do not mind shifting back to India if required. My family is not very well off. My parents do not have a lot of money save for their retirement.",nosleepnomore," Do you have a good memory? if you have the 'cover' of a reasonably relaxed job, use the time and space to acquire skills which are valuable in the market. Then use those to change / upgrade jobs. I leave it to you to decide what skills to acquire - too hard to give specific advice on the internet without knowing you / your circumstances in person.

Look for a confluence of personal interest (in acquiring a skill) and that  skill having high market value (people will pay you money for that skill).

Good Luck. Having a business is always the ideal solution but it is also very risky, plus you need to have a good idea that works and it will take a lot of energy and effort to even get it going.

Moving to the West is almost always a good idea if you are qualified enough as they provide better opportunities, pay and lifestyle. Returning to India may not be of much financial benefit. Please cross post on r/Indian_academia if you don't get any replies here. Hope it works out for you buddy.",2019-09-04 16:57:42
Business/Finance,Torn between whether to choose Canada or Australia for further studies,5,cz4498,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz4498/torn_between_whether_to_choose_canada_or/,6,"Hello Everyone! 


I have a bachelors degree in commerce and I am now eyeing for further studies. As I have a three-year degree, Canadian universities are not accepting me and the only option I have is to enroll for those two-year diplomas. But I have heard that these two-year diploma courses are not worth it as they are simply used for getting PR. How true is that? Are there any colleges that offer some decent eduction


I aim to settle whichever country I choose so PR is important for me but I also need quality education. 


As far as Australia is concerned, it is a good option but it's very expensive so I have to take up a loan. 



I am mainly interested in business/marketing/commerce/finance/economics or maybe social work. 



So can you people suggest me what to do? (My grades are decent I do not plan on taking GMAT/GRE)",4evahungry," I would say that a bachelors degree in commerce is more in enough to get a head start in life. If you still want a masters then an MBA  from a good university like IIMS or other competitive ones can be a game-changer otherwise they will only waste your precious time. 

I would recommend doing a PG in a Metro city like Ahmedabad or Bangalore and then appear for a Bank exam which is great for settling down in India with kids. You‚Äôll have to give GRE/GMAT to get into a ranked university, even in Canada and Australia. UofT, University of Melbourne, UBC, Waterloo, all ask for GMAT/GRE as far as I know. You‚Äôre exempt only if you have your undergraduate degree from overseas (US/UK etc.). 

Canada (Toronto) has really good opportunities for finance, being that it is very close to NYC, is emerging as a startup hub, all the big banks have offices here etc etc. Opportunities in Aus, although available, might not be as plentiful as in Toronto. 

I actually have a few cousins in Aus who are engineers and they have great careers. Anyone outside of the STEM stream isn‚Äôt faring that well.

Best of luck, OP!

Edit - I‚Äôd advise you to consider a one year Masters from a well known university in Europe to get over your 3 year degree dilemma. There are some universities offering excellent courses in Finance and Economics which will set you up for a good career or PHD and give you some much needed visa points for Canadian/Aus PR. 

Please don‚Äôt do Marketing. You can learn it on the job and it doesn‚Äôt require any technical training. Don‚Äôt waste your money on a marketing course. Similarly, social work is not very well paying. You‚Äôd find it hard to sustain if you aren‚Äôt well off already. Make sure you have your career path roughly drawn out before you make a move abroad.",2019-09-04 01:50:25

Business/Finance,Help! My parents are getting divorced,26,cvayjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cvayjn/help_my_parents_are_getting_divorced/,3,"My parents owned a private limited company with equal ownership. Today we found out that he has kicked out my mother from the company and put his friend as another director. How did he do this? ( Legally what could have he done?) Is there anyway we can find out (eg  letter to ministry of corporate affairs) by which we can find out what exactly did he do.

Now that they're getting divorced, how can we know if he has put all his money in a bank account we don't know about.
Though he says that he wants to split the assets, his actions say totally otherwise. I just want to get this over with and ensure that my mom gets her fair share. She struggled a lot for the house as well as for the business but she never looked into the finances or documentation trusting my father.",throwawayhelpindia," It is not easy to fire/replace a director. If your Mother **owns 50% of the company or even 1 share of the company,** ask her **not** to sign anything without a lawyer/CA/Person You Trust Present.

To change the Director, A CA/CS needs the persons letter (easily faked) and Digital Signature (occasionally kept with CA/CS). So your father can transfer the directorship.

&#x200B;

You can right now register a complaint against the CS here: [https://smash.icsi.in/Scripts/Complaint/ComplaintForm.aspx](https://smash.icsi.in/Scripts/Complaint/ComplaintForm.aspx) and here

&#x200B;

[https://www.icsi.edu/profile/organisation-structure/discipline/](https://www.icsi.edu/profile/organisation-structure/discipline/) (send this person an email)

And if a CA, then here:

[https://www.icai.org/disciplinarydirectorate/](https://www.icai.org/disciplinarydirectorate/) .

&#x200B;

Once you send do this online, also send a simple letter via speed/registered post to the regional ICSI/ICAI office and the Headquarters in Delhi. You can Google the addresses.

&#x200B;

DO BOTH, the E-Complaint & the registered Post part.

Now, the good news is that it is not possible to transfer shares without her signature!

Also, you can file a complaint with the Bank and MCA & ROC. You can send an email to the bank **right now. And  a formal letter later**  thru a lawyer/CA where the professional mentions that there is a dispute between the owners and that the company block all fund transfers.

***This can help in case your father tries to withdraw the funds.***

Also, lodge a complaint against the Company at the ROC and MCA.

I see that there is an existing master thread on the Budget. I should have ideally posted this summary there. What is PIS and FPI? \> A TV channel for startups (to be designed by startups)

Let's hope it's just not another startup news channel, 'X startup secured Y funding' is useless for 99.9% of startups.

Where as UGC type startup channel which covers knowledge rather than information i.e. 'How to identify a problem, to solve with a startup', 'How to make money with a startup', 'How to improve capital efficiency' etc. would actually be useful. What's the tax slab for hybrid vehicles going to be? Still the retarded 28+cess?

Also if this is a provision in the budget and not a rate set by the GST council, is it constitutional? If it is, then wouldn't it then become a statutory provision that the GST council cannot amend? Who will prevail? Thanku for this.",2019-07-05 22:51:58

Business/Finance,Business and boxing: two sides of the same coin,5,cqzusw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cqzusw/business_and_boxing_two_sides_of_the_same_coin/,0,"By James M. Dorsey



A podcast version of this story is available on Soundcloud, Itunes, Spotify, Stitcher, TuneIn, Spreaker, Pocket Casts, Tumblr, and Patreon, Podbean and Castbox.



What do a planned US$15 billion Saudi investment in petroleum-related Indian businesses and a controversial boxing championship have in common?



Both reflect a world in which power and economics drive policy, politics and business at the expense of fundamental rights.



And both underscore an emerging new world order in which might is right, a jungle in which dissenters, minorities and all other others are increasingly cornered and repressed.



Rather than furthering stability by building inclusive, cohesive societies both support trends likely to produce an evermore unstable and insecure world marked by societal strife, mass migration, radicalization and violence.



A world in which business capitalizes on decisions by a critical mass of world leaders who share autocratic, authoritarian and illiberal principles of governance and often reward each other with lucrative business deals for policies that potentially aggravate rather than reduce conflict.



No doubt, the planned acquisition by Saudi Arabia‚Äôs state-owned national oil company Aramco of 20 percent of the petroleum-related businesses of Reliance Industries, one of India‚Äôs biggest companies, makes commercial and strategic economic and business sense.



Yet, there is equally little doubt that the announcement of the acquisition will be read by Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, days after he scrapped the autonomous status of the troubled, majority Muslim region of Kashmir, as a license to pursue his Hindu nationalist policies that discriminate against Muslims and other minorities and fuel tensions with Pakistan, the subcontinent‚Äôs other nuclear power.



The ultimate cost of the fallout of policies and business deals that contribute or give license to exclusion rather than inclusion of all segments of a population and aggravate regional conflict could be far higher than the benefits accrued by the parties to a deal.



Underscoring the risk of exclusionary policies and unilateral moves, cross border skirmishes between Indian and Pakistani forces erupted this week along the Kashmiri frontier in which at least five people were killed.



The timing of the announcement of the Aramco Reliance deal in a global environment in which various forms of racism and prejudice, including Islamophobia, are on the rise, assures Indian political and business leaders that they are unlikely to pay an immediate price for policies that sow discord and risk loss of life.



Like in the case of Saudi and Muslim acquiescence in China‚Äôs brutal clampdown on Turkic Muslims in the troubled, north-western Chinese province of Xinjiang, the most frontal assault on a faith in recent history, the announcement risks convincing embattled Muslim minorities like the Uighurs, the Kashmiris or Myanmar‚Äôs Rohingya who are lingering in refugee camps in Bangladesh that they are being hung out to dry.



To be sure, Kashmiris can count on the support of Pakistan but that is likely to be little more than emotional, verbal and political.



Pakistan is unlikely to risk blacklisting by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), an international anti-money laundering and terrorism finance watchdog, at its next scheduled meeting in October by unleashing its anti-Indian militants.



Anthony Joshua‚Äôs controversial fight with Andy Ruiz scheduled for December in Saudi Arabia, the first boxing championship to be held in the Middle East, pales in terms of its geopolitical or societal impact compared to the Saudi Indian business deal.



Fact is that Saudi Arabia‚Äôs hosting of the championship has provoked the ire of activists rather than significant population groups. The fight is furthermore likely to be seen as evidence and a strengthening of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman‚Äôs selective efforts to socially liberalize the once austere kingdom.



Nonetheless, it also reinforces Prince Mohammed‚Äôs justified perception that Saudi Arabia can get away with imprisoning activists who argued in favour of his reforms as well as the lack of transparency on judicial proceedings against the alleged perpetrators of the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Saudi Arabia insists the killing was perpetrated by rogue operatives.



What Saudi investment in India and the scheduled boxing championship in the kingdom have in common is that both confirm the norms of a world in which ‚Äòhumane authority,‚Äô a concept developed by prominent Chinese international relations scholar Yan Xuetong, is a rare quantity.



Mr. Yan employs the concept to argue without referring to President Xi Jinping, Xinjiang, China‚Äôs aggressive approach towards the South China Sea or its policy towards Taiwan and Hong Kong that China lacks the humane authority to capitalize on US President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs undermining of US leadership.



Mr. Yan defines a state that has humane authority as maintaining strategic credibility and defending the international order by becoming an example through adherence to international norms, rewarding states that live up to those norms and punishing states that violate them. Garnering humane authority enables a state to win allies and build a stable international order.



Mr. Yan‚Äôs analysis is as applicable to India and Saudi Arabia as it is to China and others that tend towards civilizational policies like the United States, Russia, Hungary and Turkey.



It is equally true for men like Anthony Joshua promoter Eddie Hearn and business leaders in general.



To be sure, Aramco is state-owned and subject to government policy. Nonetheless, as it prepares for what is likely to be the world‚Äôs largest initial public offering, even Aramco has to take factors beyond pure economic and financial criteria into account.



At the end of the day, the consequence of Mr. Yan‚Äôs theory is that leadership, whether geopolitical, economic or business, is defined as much by power and opportunity as it is by degrees of morality and ethics.



Failure to embrace some notion of humane authority and reducing leadership and business decisions to exploiting opportunity with disregard for consequences or the environment in which they are taken is likely to ultimately haunt political and business leaders alike.



Said Mr. Yan: ‚ÄúSince the leadership of a humane authority is able to rectify those states that disturb the international order, the order based on its leadership can durably be maintained.‚Äù

What is true for political leaders is also true for business leaders even if they refuse to acknowledge that their decisions have as much political as economic impact.

Business/Finance,Mourning the demise (?) of Jet Airways,79,beaonr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/beaonr/mourning_the_demise_of_jet_airways/,36,"I am surprised to see absence of Jet Airways closure in my r/india feed.

I flew on their BOM-AMD/BDQ leg couple of times and was very impressed by their customer service. They did a pretty good job in transferring international travellers to domestic route including luggage transfer. Also, as an international traveler, I was served hot delicious breakfast even on a 45 minutes flight, which was perhaps the best way to welcome back an NRI

Never got a chance to fly on their YYZ-BOM leg. Will always be a pipe dream.

Jet airways closure will be an interesting case for MBA finance students, and a reminder to all people - Always pay your bills on time!

PS. - The online newspaper articles doesn't explain why Jet Airways ran out of money despite doing good business. Can anyone care to elaborate?",baawri_kathputli," Bought air sahara despite warning from experts, had to write off, resulting cash shortage. Also stress sector and unstable government policies. [deleted] Read this article

https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/jet-airways-timeline-when-and-what-happened-so-far-3846461.html Totally sad about jet airways leaving the scene. It was great service. It was also that one flight where tall people didn't need to pay more good leg room. The good days are gone. Miserly attitudes of India‚Äôs much famed middle class unwilling to pay for services, management issues, banks cracking down on companies run by truant owners, slowdown in the Indian economy etc. My few experiences on Jet have always been good. I hope they get operational with a new management soon. It employs a lot of people. Also the demand for air travel in India is only going to increase so Jet will leave a huge void in this sector. Yeah, it was a cheap flight and didn't feel as budget as Indigo or SpiceJet. Good service and great air hostesesseseses too. Will be missed. Yeah I've had a great time on Jet Airways as well.

I've only travelled by Jet , Indigo as of now.  
Had a much better time at Jet. On Jet, I was served free (and actually quite good) food. I got nothing on indigo. The airhostesses (guy and girl) seemed much much better on jet.  

At the airport itself, had a much better time with jet, than with Indigo. Not sure about others, or if I was in a special situation or anything, but yeah, I had a much better time on Jet than with Indigo.

(Travel experience : 1 round trip with jet, and another round trip with Indigo) Had a few memorable flights with jet.

Flew with jet when jet and air India was only premium offering...

Hated traveling by spice or go or indigo...

Always got middle seat empty on my sector.

Decently priced.

International circuit was good. Service was decent ( nothing too much, just enough)...

In a race with air india, it was indeed good.

As for other international carriers, it wasn't good. Nope. I only had one good experience in 2006 where i was served some decent meal and a fresh towel to wipe my face.

After the luxury of Kingfisher in it's heyday, jet always seemed over hyped and overpriced. 

Flew on their international flights last year, and it felt like i was flying Air India. Rubbish food, sparing cabin service and visibly aging aircraft. Bad situation for the employees very average airline in terms of flying experience. I didn't see the point of paying extra compared to indigo/spicejet for the almost same service. I had a jet airways flight in the morning, now I have no idea if/when I will get my money back. What are my options? I booked it through PayTM. 

What's worse is that I HAD to be where I needed to be and ended up booking a much more expensive flight. Fucking sucks. Talking about YYZ-BOM sector, looks like I am down $4000 because Jet shut down.

Today has been an absolutely awful day because of that. :(

Edit: I had booked 3 family members on AMD-BOM-YYZ return trips and I don't think I'll ever see that money. I was even thinking getting business class for one of the tickets (my grandmother). That would've been another $2000 down lol. At least I have that going for me, which is nice 3 months ago I flew jet airways from Paris chennai and back to Paris. Worst flight, service experience for an international flight. At that time itself I complained to their customer service. Sorry to say this.  I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre out of business. I‚Äôve flown many international airlines and this was the worst of it all. Lost all my JP miles :(",2019-04-18 07:09:57

UNION BUDGET 2019:-

Summary:  Low impact on personal finance as such.  There are some good noises on NBFC, startup, etc.  More help given to small businesses in GST.  Gold duty hiked to 12.5%.

Edit: Custom duty hike in many electronic items. This can affect your purchase decisions.  Mi phones may become cheaper than OnePlus :-)

also, DHFL's stock price has been going down steep the past year.   

&nbsp;  

1. what exactly is the problem at DHFL?  
1. are they seeing poor loan repayments by home loan borrowers?  
1. is this the canary-in-coalmine   situation for a wider home-loan / real estate crash in India ?  
1. what causes led to this situation?   
1. did DHFL lend too aggressively / to 'sub prime' borrowers?  
1. what other lenders did similar practices , and are likely to face similar situation?  
1. is there any link between ILFS situation and DHFL ?  
1. if DHFL crashes (like ~~NSDL~~ NSEL, Giranjali gems, Kingfisher, etc) what would be the wider consequences? would their retail home-loan borrowers still need to continue paying EMIs after the lender company is liquidated / closed? (kek)    
1. from whom has DHFL borrowed money? what would be that lender's impact?  
1. are real-estate builders impacted in any manner due to this?  
* would this be yet another case of ""socialise the losses"" and hence some govt company (LIC esp) rescuing DHFL ?",donoteatthatfrog," There are multiple factors involved.

Firstly NBFCs model is flawed. They borrow short term say 6 months to a year and lend Long term say 3-5 years.
Because of this they have to constantly keep raising funds.

Dhfl crisis happened because of poor liquidity on Dhfl part as they have some 20% exposure in bad performing real estate firms. But the Main cause of crisis is because of IL&FS. They had mismanagement of funds by senior managers of their subsidiaries because of which they defaulted on emis and the crisis began.

Now Dhfl wanted to raise funds because their short term borrowings were maturing but mutual funds as well as share market was pulling money from nbfcs as they deemed it too risky because of IL&FS. Because of this Dhfl was forced to borrow funds at very high interest.

This is the jist of it there is more to this. I recommend watching finnovationz video on this topic. NSDL crashed before? Then there is that Cobrapost expose as well. Something is shady at DHFL.",2019-05-29 18:28:13

‚ñ† **Ornit Shahni, [How India Became Democratic](https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/how-india-became-democratic/) (Penguin, 2018)**

Shahni's book is a fascinating historical account of how the first electoral rolls in India were prepared. This is a process that is so technical and bureacratic that we don't always stop to consider how this laid the foundation for our democracy today. She uses archival materials to bring out how people struggled to gain the fundamental democratic right to vote in our first elections, and how this struggle informed the Constitution-making process.

Banerjee's book is an ethnographic study that attempts to answer the question of why Indians exercise their right to vote. Through interviews in a number of states, including Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Rajasthan, she asks ordinary voters why they vote, what they think of politics and elections, and what drives them to participate in the democratic process.

https://penguin.co.in/book/uncategorized/the-verdict/ Thank you for making the list, OP.  A forthcoming book that looks interesting as well is Ruchir Sharma's Democracy on the Road (Penguin) but I haven't read that as yet.  Thanks for the list OP. There's also a new podcast by Milan Vaishnav called [Grand Tamasha](https://carnegieendowment.org/grandtamasha/) . It is a co-prod with HT and Darnegie Endowment for Peace. I recommend The Verdict. Also off topic, but can someone recommend a book that summarises the Constituent Assembly Debates about what went into making the constitution? mandatory mention of India After Gandhi, which covers the first election (and some important subsequent elections) I'd add Ruchir Sharma's **Democracy on the Road: A 25 Year Journey through India** to this list. 

From the 1990s to December 2018, he and journalist/analyst friends of his basically take road trips to most Indian states to see state and general election campaigns. It cites many of the academics listed in this thread, but it's a book for everyone and each chapter covers a different election. Quite funny/eye-opening/shocking at various points, as  they talk to everyone from Maoists to RSS to swing voters.

Business/Finance,Please help me with career advice,18,ahuc0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ahuc0c/please_help_me_with_career_advice/,13,"I am a 24 year old male with BBA in Finance. I studied in Thailand. My family lives in Thailand. We have a diamond trading business. I worked with my dad for a year before finding a job in a jewelry factory. I have been working in this factory for little over a year now.

I am being paid 55k baht a month. The problem is, there isn't much growth in this industry. I feel the industry is shrinking. I am hoping to get out by this year. Another problem is, it is very difficult to get a job as a foreigner in Thailand. 

What skills can I develop on the side so I can switch industries? I am thinking programming. But I have no prior knowledge. I do not mind coming back to India for work.

Is MBA a good option? What other ways can I make money on the side?

I have around 10 lac rupees saved.",nosleepnomore," You are making decent money and India doesn't really have the jobs or growth it used to.

Diamond trade globally is dominated by Gujju's, why not go up the supply chain and apply for management positions at customer facing companies. 

You don't seem very enthusiastic about your current line of work. You definitely need to work for a few more years to get some clarity on the general direction you want to take.

MBA is an expensive decision and should be taken with much more thought and is not a guarantee to reduce or remove your current confusion.

You have an advantage of being in a more developed country surrounded by fast growing economies along with India as a back-up. You already have some professional assets/experiences in place. Use that to discover more and learn and spend your life savings on a degree when you are sure about what you want.  So you're talking about career shift and rapid growth. with a managerial experience and international exposure, an international mba from top 20 would be a good bet. If you want to study in India, ISB is one such option. Do you hold a Thai passport? If yes, look into getting into the IIMs via the foreign student route. Much easier to get in than through the regular CAT Tell me which Indian dude gets paid 15L per annum like you are, at the age of 24? Guys with your qualification in india earn 1/5th of what you earn. Since you‚Äôve saved 10L until now, which is a great amount of money for your age, you can do an MBA and a PGDM from a **top ranked university** under NRI quota for that amount. You‚Äôll need a good number of years put aside for that, and then you‚Äôll get jobs that pay above 10LPA in the beginning. After that, the sky‚Äôs the limit. I think you already earn well enough, and really don‚Äôt need to come to india which has its own problems of having way too much of competition for a job. The Thailand govt cares about their country more than India does and I think you‚Äôll earn really well staying there instead of coming to India. Lady boi ban ja. ",2019-01-20 18:15:34

A little about myself. I'm 30 yr old Indian woman working in IT and earning well. I am the only kid and my mother raised me as a single parent after my dad left us.She has raised me to be independent and has given me freedom unlike other Indian families.

I had my share of relations when I was young and I was single for a considerable amount of time in mid 20's and I made good use of it. I started traveling and over years have come to love it. Travel opened doors for me in blogging and photography and my friends say I am decent at both. Being single also taught me value of friendships and I'm fortunate to have made some solid bonds over the years.

I met my bf (32 yrs) two years ago and with time we realized we do want to spend our lives together. As we started talking about future I realized that my bf is very keen to move to his hometown and take over his family business/ agriculture (he mentioned it casually once a yr ago. I had no idea he was serious about it).  I refused to agree for this as it is hard for me to relocate to a place which has zero opportunities for career. I hate the idea of staying at home or being dependent for finances. For the reasons above and also that I would be giving up all my friends,leaving my mom,work, travel everything for one person seemed like a bad deal.

We tried to come up with solutions but none of them made of us happy and hence agreed for mutual breakup. This breakup has left bitter feelings in me about everything. I want to stop feeling negative about my ex (somewhere I feel he could have stayed considering he has been staying in the city for 20+ yrs) and stop feeling sad for myself. I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head.Any suggestions are welcome!

Thanks,

Ablahnaari!

&#x200B;",ablahnaari," Chill dude, no need to worry. It's better to be alone than with someone with whom you're not comfortable. Living by yourself has its own advantage.  * You have time. 30 is not that old. Get back out there when you are ready.
* Don't blame yourself, or your ex. If you wanted different things in life and had strong convictions about your choices, either one of you would have had to compromise and deal with the resentment that typically follows compromising core beliefs or the relationship would have fallen apart at some point if neither one wants to compromise. 
* If it had to end, Its better it ended now and not after you were married and in your late thirties or later.
* Give it some time and re-evaluate, feelings always clouds reality. Everyone feels like the universe is conspiring against them after something bad happens. Time heals most wounds if you let it.
* Stay Positive. I am 33 years old, have never been in a relationship, no marriage proposal seems to work out for myriad reasons, yet I keep faith while also keeping fit, enjoying my life, finding new interests and try to travel as much as I can amidst incredibly heavy pressure from my parents and ""society"". Last thing one needs is to give in to bullshit societal standards. Love has no sell by date.
* You mentioned you love to travel, do more of it, its a great distraction. Plan a trip in the near future. Travel has healing and transformative powers.

I wish you all the best!
  The dude lived in the city for 20+ years and wants to go farm? Let him. He seems passionate about it, don‚Äôt hold him back.

As for you, you are too young to be worried about what‚Äôs gonna happen to you. Take it easy and move on; you have no idea what‚Äôs in store. 

That ablanaari shit was funny though üòä >I am scared that I might end up alone given the age taboo/caste etc in India and quite not sure how to deal with all the negativity in my head

Stop worrying about that crap and work on making yourself a better person. Pickup some new hobbies. Hang out with your friends or try making new ones. I have to admit that I have not travelled as much as you did.

But my only suggestion right now is to pack your bag and leave your home.
 You will get a  better solution as I am pretty sure you will meet up someone who has solutions to all your problems. 

LPT: Just talk to as many people as possible. find new things to do. the less you sit and ponder, the better it'll be. give it time, and then ponder, and let go.

live life forward, not backwards. You took the right longterm decision. The blaming, bitterness and sadness for a few months is common. Convince and coax your mind that you took a good positive long-term decision for the reasons you have yourself mentioned. 

*Express* your thoughts and justifications and plans in some way. For me, writing them in detail in a diary worked. But if you're not into writing, record an audio or video of yourself discussing it with yourself. 

Or if you have a close friend who's a good listener, express it in front of them. I don't know the psychology behind why expressing your thoughts to yourself or others actually helps, but it does.

As for fear of society, most people don't bother and those who trash talk you can be ignored or even belittled. Solo life is not bad as you yourself already seem to have explored it quite a bit. I'd suggest getting into any new relationship only for positive reasons - such as love and companionship - and never for negative or shallow reasons - such as fear / reputation / social status.  take it from a 24 y/o guy, who got cheated multiple times and lost faith in love.

&#x200B;

Smoke a joint, let go off things, and start afresh. 30 ain't too old. You still have a good 4-5 years before you settle down. Goodluck and learn to forgive but not forget :) 30+something, just broke up. Its very normal to hate your ex even if he/she hasnt done anything horrible. 

&#x200B;

Be kind to yourself. Im not a believer in god or spirituality but mindfulness has helped me. What are you going through is grief. Its the same feeling as you would feel if a loved one died. You probably already know the 5 stages of grief. You are going to go through all of it, not in sequence but in circles. Give yourself time and be kind to yourself. 

&#x200B;

Trust me I went through this, Im not out yet .. but I am a million times better than what I was immediately after.  curious question... is the word 'abla' or 'ablah'? i know certain indian demographic ppl like to add 'h' around their 'T's but cmon why here? i am pretty sure the actual word is abla

Business/Finance,What would be a better decision? [Serious],24,abqu80,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/abqu80/what_would_be_a_better_decision_serious/,17,"24 year old male, working in a day job from 8 am to 8 pm. I come from a BBA in Finance background but have been working in a jewellery factory. 

I want to learn to programme and investing in the little free time I have. Programming so that I can switch jobs in two years or at the least freelance (Note: I have zero knowledge about programming). Also, after reading several articles, they mention programming is one of the jobs that is to stay even when robots become prevalent. 

My second option is to start an online business. I do not know what the business will be as I really haven't thought about it.

What would you do if you were in my position? Develop skills or start a side hustle? 

I make 50K a month and the expenses are growing exponentially. ",nosleepnomore," Bhai 8am-8pm is not a day job, it's slavery.

Aur programme ki jagah program karna seekhna.

Waise freelancers ki koi aukaat nahi hai, and i can prove that. Freelancer.com pe jaake koi bhi project daalna, india se freelancers toot padenge. I‚Äôll just add some information to help you make your decision:
Entry level job in Infosys pays ~25k per month. But during their training period there is virtually no expenditure. 
 If you are going to learn programming for job security (and considering robots a threat, no less), without having any knowledge about it, I'd say try something else you already know. Programming can be fun but your motivations are not in line with what makes it fun. Absolutely, try it. But don't expect to earn decently in a matter of a couple of years.

Similarly, ""an online business"" is too vague. If you have some particular thing in mind, we can probably give you a fair idea if we'll buy it or not. 

If I were in your position, I'd try programming for a couple of months and look at what I can possibly sell online and if I can find business partners. I'll tell my experiences here and *then* ask how I should proceed.
 You can land yourself a high paying programming job provided you have good credentials like hackerearth rank / GSoC rank / github profile. I have seen a unemployed non-IT BSc Chemistry 27 year old guy do it by self learning coding. Good luck !! Working in jewellery factory means what? Are you a Craftsman? Learn to communicate clearly what you have experience doing otherwise people without understanding your background might give misleading advice?

If you do have some years of training and skill with your hands in making jewellery then it's not a bright idea to switch to programming. Unless you don't like your job, keep improving your skill. A skilled person plus a machine will always beat a skilled person alone or a machine alone. 

The problem with robots (like your cell phone), every two years maintaining them and updating software and changing their hardware designs (because what customers want change constantly and hardware improves constantly) is very very expensive. So having skilled people operating machines is always going to be the better choice.

Jewellery sector in India is quite big and growing esp exports. The amounts people are spending on top quality jewellery has hugely increased. 
One option maybe is to try to move to better companies/bigger brand names/export oriented companies etc and gain experience.  Typical Indian mentality : get on the IT wagon == one true and absolute certain way of survival.

So sad. the real question is why would IT companies hire you as a software dev?

there are too many of us already, and for you to catchup its going to be extremely hard. even if you somehow become good enough, 6lpa will not be what they would be paying.

Not saying it can't be done, but you should know that to make big money at big N companies, you really have to become great coder. Which is something I have been struggling with.",2019-01-02 20:10:50
Business/Finance,"Suddenly, ‚Äòone nation, one policy‚Äô sentiment is overtaking other models -Interview with YV Reddy, IAS, former RBI Governor and 14th Finance Commission Chairman",7,azoh6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/azoh6g/suddenly_one_nation_one_policy_sentiment_is/,3,"You have said in your book that there is a feeling in some quarters that cooperative federalism is being replaced with coercive federalism. What is the basis for this comment?

>Some developments have taken place after the 14th Finance Commission‚Äôs (FC) recommendations. Cesses and surcharge have increased significantly, even after GST. The States felt that they were being short-changed by the way the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) were restructured, increasing the share that the State government has to put in and then the way the GST is being administered. The general debate earlier was about the Bihar model competing with the Gujarat model and different States‚Äô models of development competing with each other.

>Now, suddenly the ‚Äúone nation, one policy‚Äù sentiment is overtaking the other models. And the Planning Commission, which was a forum for States, is also not there now.

>Due to this institutional vacuum, Ministries are directly dealing with CSS. So, the spirit of discussion and dialogue is being replaced by diktats by various Ministries. Some say that there is no dialogue, which is untypical of cooperative federalism.

You‚Äôve said that States are now forced to share more from their own resources in CSS. After your own 14th FC recommendations, the impression was that the Centre was devolving more to the States as it went up from 32% to 42%.

>As my co-author G.R. Reddy will explain, the comparison is not between 32% and 42%; what was 39% became 42%, because of the way the computations differed. This increase was more than offset by the other actions on cesses and surcharges and CSS. So there has been virtually no advantage for the States

>G.R. Reddy: The 14th FC considered the entire revenue account. Unlike the previous FCs, it considered even the Plan revenue account. As a result, some of the Plan transfers were subsumed under tax devolution.

>The difference between 14th FC and others is that the former did away with sector specific grants that amount to 4-5% of the total devolution. If you take these two together, the actual devolution would have been 39% earlier and that became 42%. Even this 3% increase is not very visible because it has been more than neutralised by the Centre. The reality is that it has increased the matching contribution of the States in CSS and done away with 6000 model schools started in 2011; half way through, in 2015-16, it took a decision to terminate the entire scheme of model schools.

>The entire burden of running schools and meeting expenditure ‚Äì both capital and operational expenditure, has now fallen on the States.

>They then restructured 66 CSS into 22 umbrella schemes. So there is no change in the number of CSS schemes. All components have remained the same.

Why didn‚Äôt States raise the issue?

>We have done so before the 15Th FC‚Ä¶ and communicated to the Centre that what they had done was not correct.

>Immediately after the 14th FC recommendations were accepted, the Hon Prime Minister wrote to us saying ‚Äònow that the States are flush with funds‚Ä¶‚Äô, We wrote back saying there is absolutely no increase in the flow of funds to the States, but only a change in the composition of transfers in favour of untied transfers. Now what has happened is there has been a qualitative change in the transfers to States ‚Äì we are getting more money through untied transfers.

>The total transfers as a percentage of gross revenues to the States from the Centre has remained at the same level ‚Äì 49%.

Aren‚Äôt untied transfers desirable? It frees States to use funds for whatever purpose they deem fit‚Ä¶

>Whatever additional money to have come through untied transfers is now tied up towards meeting the additional commitment.

>In the revised pattern of CSS, you have to put in more money.

>You have made a commitment, you can‚Äôt ‚Äòuncommit‚Äô. But they have changed the pattern. Whatever untied funds you have got, you put in those schemes.

>For example, in 2014, Telangana‚Äôs contribution to the CSS was around ‚Çπ2,000 crore. In 2015-16, because of the change in funding patterns, it has gone up to ‚Çπ3,500 crore. So there is additional commitment on the part of the States.

>There is further commitment for States, because of termination of some CSS ‚Äì the model schools scheme is an example. Another is BRGF ‚Äì backward regions grant fund - for Telangana State, 9 of the then 10 districts were under the BRGF. They substantially reduced allocations under women and child welfare also.

>There is a view that there are just too many CSS ‚Äì money is not efficiently used

>The other concern with CSS is that the money is too thinly spread across schemes. For example, if you take education or health, States are spending close to 80%. The Centre is supplementing the States up to only 20%, which does not make much difference. That too comes with conditionalities, submission of uses, visits of Central teams, delays in release of funds. As a result of these procedures, we are unable to fully utilise the Centre‚Äôs allocations. I don‚Äôt think any State has used the funds from Centre entirely.

So the solution is to offer funds and allow States a free hand?

>The Commission under Dr. Reddy recommended the same ‚Äì that the number of CSS should be restricted to some nationally identified priorities.

>Dr. Y.V. Reddy: Basic issue is that Finance Commission is one mechanism which essentially is meant for sharing of taxes and that is based on a formula. 80-90% of transfers to States has always been on tax devolution. In tax devolution, there are no conditions, how much weight you give for population, which census‚Äô population and other consideration namely as fiscal capacity. The only question there is what weight you give. If you give weight equally for efficiency and equity, they cancel out, in some sense.

You mentioned institutional vacuum. Do you think NITI Aayog has not been able to step up to the plate?

>There were some deficiencies in the way the Planning Commission functioned. There was an impression given to the States that they had to go to the Commission as a supplicant but not for discussion. That was its weakness which had to be corrected. In the correction process, that bad habit was got rid of but there was no new system. There is no forum now. Each Ministry has become an authority unto itself and is able to dictate terms to the States.

Is it deliberate that the Aayog does not have power or did it evolve thus?

>That is a question mark. Whether it was by design or by default, the result is that the individual Ministries are indicating to the States, which means there is no coherent and comprehensive view of the States in the process.

There is a view that some of the terms of reference of the 15th FC may not stand the test of constitutional validity. What‚Äôs your view?

>There are 3-4 issues. It is true that it generated unprecedented reaction. Never before for an FC have a number of CMs got together and protested. Also, some scholars questioned the constitutional validity of some Terms of Reference ‚Äì for example, whether there is need for revenue deficit.

>The constitution provides for it and each FC needs to decide on this. Third, the 15th FC has been asked to review the 14th FC. It is a continuing process. Above all, the Commission has been asked to make recommendations keeping in view some performance indicators and that States should conform to certain policy parameters, which reflected the existing policy of the Centre.

>The way the FC is structured, it is not supposed to be an instrument of the central government‚Äôs priorities of the day. So it has been questioned on several grounds.

>Most of the considerations mentioned in the ToR are not necessarily binding on the FC. The Commission can choose to or choose not to take these into account. But it needs courage and vision for the Commission to do so ‚Äì we are hoping that will be there.

What‚Äôs your view on the controversy over the base date of population census in the 15th FC?

>The whole question is whether it is a correct thing or not. It is difficult to defend outdated population as the basis. Because the FC is supposed to take into account the needs of the State for the period. How can 1971 population determine the needs of the State in 2021? It was undertaken on the grounds that States should not be penalised. But what about States that have taken action on family planning after 1971? They don‚Äôt get anything. It should be a continuing incentive, right?

>This time, they prescribed 2011 population. That is also not valid. The FC recommendations are from 2020. So you should have estimated population of the States for the period 2020-2025. Ideally, there should be no stipulation of a date for population and should be left to the FC but if at all, one should have the population relevant for the period.

Isn‚Äôt GST a good example of cooperative fiscal federalism?

>It is an extraordinary institution and is commendable. It did not come into existence overnight. It started as an informal committee in the Finance Ministry and has evolved. In the implementation, there has been dissatisfaction expressed. The fact that the Centre has a veto increases its influence. But that is part of the game. Concerns may be there in the way it is working. But as an institutional set up, it is extraordinarily good. It is a good example of collaboration and cooperation in an institution between the Union and the States.

Can this be replicated in other areas?

>Exactly. This is on the revenue side. On the expenditure side, fiscal transfers outside the FC, it can be brought under some inter-State council. That was the recommendation of the 14th FC.

>The GST Council may not be replicated but is a good approach to build on. On the expenditure side, it is a different type of collaboration, compared to the revenue side.

Is that a recommendation that the 15th FC can give?

>Yes. The transfers to the States from the Centre can take FC and non-FC routes. The 14th FC gave recommendations on how to structure the non-FC transfers. It‚Äôs only in the ambit of advice.

>There are three approaches: virtually abolish the Commission by making a constitutional amendment and say this will be the percentage; the second is to have a continuous FC, a GST Council type of mechanism but the FC gets subsumed in this; the third is to have the FC and a design of new institutional arrangements which will be more technical, more political and more consensus-based, as recommended by the 14th FC.

>All this is provoked partly because of the GST Council which has been positive and partly because of the institutional vacuum ‚Äî both these are pushing us to find new institutional mechanisms.

Pleasantly surprised at the functioning of the GST Council. It comprises people with varying vote bank compulsions.

>The consensus has been the result of number of years of effort. Consultative process has been going on for the last 10-15 years. States also are convinced that it is a win-win situation, for the sake of tax harmonisation across the country, they felt it was better. And there was also the feeling that GST is a better form of tax, leading to better compliance. It builds up a value chain. Initially, there was some apprehension on part of manufacturing States that they may lose out this being a destination tax. So we have put in place a 2 year statutory mechanism that they will be compensated for a period of 5 years. The states have yielded lot more space than the Centre. For States, VAT constituted about 60% of their old tax revenue. They have conceded 50% of their fiscal space to the Centre, whereas the space conceded by the Centre is only 30%. They still get customs duty, income tax etc. In the working, there is still a trust deficit because the voting pattern is fully loaded in favour of the Centre, which has almost a veto power.

>Then, the way the GST is administered is also raising apprehensions in the minds of the people that they are not being treated fairly by the Centre. Like delays in apportionment of IGST, delays in payment of compensation cess, collecting more compensation cess than required. Best thing to do is to reduce compensation cess correspondingly that they are not doing. So there is surplus compensation cess lying with the Centre to be distributed after 5 years. It is for the Centre to set the record straight and remove this trust deficit.

On the special category status for Andhra Pradesh, what was the stand that you took in the 14th FC?

>Special category status is not under the jurisdiction of any FC. In my book, I have explained the Centre‚Äôs version of the relationship between 14th FC recommendation and the special category.

>If you want the simple truth, 14th FC did not make any recommendation on inclusion or exclusion of special category. The issue of according special category status and assurance by the PM was given months before the 14th FC could give recommendations.

>But the government has its own explanation as to why it interprets the recommendations of 14th FC with regard to special category status. I have given that in the book. It is for the reader to decide why and how these are related.

Cess is becoming a monster in the administrative system. With GST we assumed that cess won‚Äôt any longer be a part of the system. But with Kerala, we have a disaster cess. Isn‚Äôt the purpose of a reform lost with such acts?

>There is a calamity fund and the Centre is expected to come to the assistance of states when such things happen and there is always a burden sharing, you can‚Äôt anticipate this. Now the recourse to cess for such things is unusual.

Isnt this a step away from cooperative fiscal federalism? The Council is telling one state that funds needed for rebuilding after a disaster are to be generated from within that State...

>That is why some of them are dissenting calling it coercive federalism. These are ‚Äòinnovations‚Äô that some States are uncomfortable with.

You have Kerala at the upper end of the social development scale and Uttarakhand at the lower end; T.N., Gujarat and Maharashtra at the higher end of the economic development index with Odisha and Bihar at the other. How is it possible for any central body, including the FC to reconcile these differences?

>That is exactly the issue with regard to any federation. In any federation there are competing considerations. You have to build trust amongst yourselves so therefore there is no fixed formula. That‚Äôs how you operate the system.

>What is needed is for the Centre to be able to bring together the States and treat these inequalities or calamities as a national problem in which both Union and States participate. Problem now is that whenever a State opposes the Centre it is accused of being anti-national. Being anti-union is not anti-national.

>There are 3 levels of debate ‚Äì State interest, Union interest, national interest. To build a national consensus, the Union and States must be together. If the States get the feeling that the Union has abrogated to itself the sole authority of national interest, the States resent it. That is the essence of the matter.

How much is this because of a strong leader at the top?

>You should go back to Constituent Assembly debates. Dr Ambedkar when introducing the draft constitution, discusses the merits and demerits of parliamentary and presidential form of government and says why parliamentary system is important for India. He says that India is essentially undemocratic and therefore emphasises on continuous accountability. He says continuous accountability is more important than stability. That was the deliberate choice on this type of issue.

In 14th FC, you recommended forest cover as a determinant. In the five years that have lapsed, have you studied how that recommendation has helped India‚Äôs environment cause?

>No. But it‚Äôs an interesting area where we have to see the impact of the recommendation. But the logic is simple ‚Äì forest cover. The state govt is contributing to environment at a cost to itself. It cannot use the resource but has to maintain it. So you have to provide for it. The basic principle is externalities. The state is contributing at its own cost ‚Äì it does not gain anything. It incurs cost to maintain the forest.

[The Hindu](https://www.thehindu.com/business/Economy/yv-reddy-interview/article26489119.ece)",Avinash_Sharma, I've always liked the forest cover model of assigning tax resources to the States. It's a very esteemable initiative. [deleted] Summary ,2019-03-11 17:09:27

M21, Delhi

&#x200B;

I've invented a stationary utility device and now want to turn it in a business. I've applied for design, patent,trademarks as Intellectual properties. I have completed msme and gst registration. i've prepared visiting cards, proprietor stamp, installed billing software and a 100 pgs letterpad. I have a batch of 400 pcs ready to test the market .  I won't disclose it before the launch so please don't ask about it (no offence).

Not bragging just giving the information, I've done everything alone from research to paperwork to purchase raw material to manufacturing( plastic parts come from factory. i have to assemble it and pack in the box) to finance/money stuff (ca does gst returns). It has really taken a toll on me.

&#x200B;

here's my work environment.

i want to operate from home. my parents are agreed to this and i have access to half of first floor. it's a single room where i do the assembly(tightening screws to join parts) and packing and in one corner i have a table where i do rest of company related work from a laptop.

i'm trying to outsource the packing and assembly but still i'll have to store raw materials and final stock in that room till sent to amazon warehouse or factory.

&#x200B;

i really don't have budget for renting a shop and hiring employee. i want to execute this testing phase alone. if it'll be successfull then i'll get a shop, employees and other equipments but rightnow i don't want to create too much financial burdon on my parents

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my queries are

1. can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator.  and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.
2. do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

&#x200B;

3.  do i need to pay rent to parents.

&#x200B;

4. can i  cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

&#x200B;

5. do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

&#x200B;

6 do i need current account. my expenses are small and i'm currently operating from savings account.  banks (hdfc, icici, bob,axis) are asking for in house verifications and demanding a banner in front of my house. i'll never put a banner in front of house as padosi bade madar\*\*\*\* hain.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

anything else you want to advice me you're welcome guys. I'm just a 21 year old trying to escape from the rat race and want to really contribute something to the world.

&#x200B;

\[EDIT\]   do i need to register  or do anything under shop and establishment act? 

&#x200B;

do i need a manufacturers licence ?",cooltechpec," >my queries are

>can i do my business from home . do i need to do any paperwork or permission or licencing. my stock takes space only about a refrigerator. and all i need a printer and laptop for other stuff.

Yes, you can. no permision or licences are required.

>do i need commercial electricity meter. if so, then can my father apply for that (he owns the house and is a GOVT. employee). Is there any way i can avoid that as i'll get my own shop after testing phase and that commercial connection at home will be a waste.

No you do not. Unless you are running a factory consuming alot of electricity. Get your shop later once you make a profit.

>do i need to pay rent to parents.

Up to you, if you feel your parents deserve the revenue for allowing you to conduct business from their home. (personal relations)

>can i cause complications for my father as he's a govt. employee.

NO, this is your business. so it will not affect his job

>do i need any permission from mcd or other anyone.

NO

>do i need current account.

It is advisable to get it as you can separate your personal expense from the business expense, so get it. Most current accounts allow a minimum balance of only 10k 

If you are looking for markets to showcase your product, PM me.  You're overthinking this OP. Forget about permissions and licenses and everything else. 

Get sales first. Everything comes after that. 

Just make sure to not make your dad a director in the company (pvt ltd). Government employees can't be directors in private companies Good luck mate!
 I am very curious about your product and I hope you will post an update about it once you launch it. All the best. You need to give more information. 

What is the per piece sale price, and what is the size of the product? 

Who are your customers? How do you plan to sell the product and in what quantity.

The answers to these may change the answers to your questions. Can't you rent a shop for few months for your trial phase? 

Since your dad is a government employee, is the housing accommodation provided by his employee? If he is a government employee, then someone out there can create a fuss if they want to. That's the nature of it, and legality or the illegality of it comes later.

But again, you are at the moment not making any money. So it's okay to launch from your house. But as soon as you start making money, talk to a lawyer to see if your business needs special permits that can make your operations illegal. For instance, since the house is in your dad's name, he could be accused of moonlighting on a commercial venture. 

If you cannot find a leased space, you could also talk to your university or universities in the vicinity. Many of them have entrepreneurship cells and they could help you out with something (leasing out space, etc.)
 Bhai best of luck I wish you all the best. I can't answer your question as I am a salaried professional..

---",root_su," We will announce a special scheme to help the governments of Haryana, Punjab and Delhi to manage crop residue to curb air pollution


About time.  1.9 Crore salaried people paid 1.44 lakh crore as tax

1.88 crore individual business paid 48000 crore as tax Health and education budget looks impressive, they improved from last time Health coverage for 50 crore people, moving towards Universal health coverage. Nice, very nice. [deleted] Those under 5L salary saying that they don't need pay any tax BUT should remember about CESS tax. LTCG is the most disappointing feature of this budget. RIP NPS. Universal health wow... they nailed it.  Special scheme to support UP, Haryana and Punjab for pollution control efforts, to reduce pollution in Delhi NCR: FM everyone is talking about LTCG no one is mentioning the 10% on divendends distribution by equity mutual funds

http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/market/budget-2018-dividend-distribution-tax-equity-mutual-funds/story/269421.html Is LTCG applicable on 3years lock in of ELSS? For the good of this country make everyone declare their earnings/income.

 You've already linked every transaction with Aadhaar via bank and mobile and electronic payment methods. 

If you knew what farmers(not the labour which works on farms) actually make in a year you might want to reframe the taxation scheme altogether. Bjp when it was in opposition

http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/news/Raise-I-T-slab-to-Rs-5-lakh-demands-Arun-Jaitley/article20756508.ece First reduce bank interest / FD rates drastically luring the middle class person towards Equity Mutual Funds as an option to save/make money, despite the risk, if he invests for the long-term. Then impose tax on what he earns from there too. Disappointed there are no tangible benefits to the salaried class. They are the one who fuel the economy.  Bengaluru metro gets money Has there been a 4+ hr budget fest before? 

Official parliamentary budget coupled with a 2 hr fest of the PM and FM back to back on television. Petrol and Diesel excise duty cut, so they should become cheaper by 2 Rs. [deleted] 150 cr to commemorate Gandhiji. 

Bc unke ideals hi adopt kar lo. Free hai. Indian salaried middle class is treated like a pair of balls to be squeezed dry as and when others need feeding. Custom duty on mobile phones increased from 15 to 20%. is it true that Nehru did this year's budget?  bhai koi seedha seedha batao.

kya ab movie tickets and fast food mehenga pade ga ki nahi? Sutte ka kuchh bola kya? [deleted] Bengaluru will get a suburban train network: Jaitley Can someone explain the LTCG tax he announced?  Fucking hell. They don't have any manufacturing inside country and when I try to import it from outside ,they fuck me in the ass with customs. Fuck this fucking country and fuck this government Threw in AI, 3D printing etc to excite the nerds. This was a very disappointing budget from the tax point of view..
Finmin didn't even look at sec. 80 deductions let aside revising the tax structure..
Deeply disappointed.. From Twitter: 

Middle Class will now have to pay:

Goods and Service Tax.

Long Term Capital Gain Tax.

Income Tax.

Increased Cess on Income Tax.

This will make them fall in BPL category and hence will be able to avail all Govt Schemes.

Masterstroke by Modi ji. [deleted] Seriously not happy about LTCG. They could have excluded ELSS. Or maybe introduced 0% tax for all holdings greater than 3 years. I have a feeling this will have a bad impact on the market.   Tax Update : Payments in cash exceeding Rs. 10000/\- to be disallowed.  As a pakoda seller, chutney anyone? Middle class being shown the middle finger once again.


Govt never fears any backlash  from them because they  have the most to lose ,but they still aren't powerful enough to have their voice amount to something.


They have to pander to poor people to keep the votes from slipping and
if they don't appease the corporates they'll withdraw their funding.


Middle class they can afford to screw over. Nobody is talking about the elephant in the room.
  
In long term every one is going to get income tax increases because of the public healthcare program.
  
Take countries that have universal healthcare, I'll give you how income taxes look around the world.

+ Canada upto 60%
+ Germany upto 47.475%
+ Sweden upto 60%
  
Take any country that has public healthcare and you'll see tax rates that will make you cry blood.

Now one percent increase in cess might not seem like a lot. Look at how this will affect you in the long term.
  
More over majority of the health ailments are because of life choices and are self inflicted ailments.

+ Fucking drunk people destroying their livers.
+ Something about tobacco users and smokers getting cancer...
+ People eating shitty food and getting sugar and cholesterol... (Heart ailments)
+ Some idiots being irresponsible and having abortion... or having 6 kids for that matter...
etc.
  
Who the fuck pays for BJP's pet project???
  
+ The tax payers who already pay fuck load of taxes on their income and whatever they buy (GST)...
+ People who pay more taxes than their rent.
+ People who don't own cars...
  
Public healthcare is the worst idea ever.

Well take it in the ass and cough up the taxes or get ready to go to jail for not paying taxes.

Edit: Updated Germany tax rates. Immediate update on direct tax changes from the budget speech -

1.	Real estate ‚Äì double taxation in respect of immovable property. No adjustment where 5% difference is there.

2.	MSME ‚Äì Corporate tax rate 25% to companies having T/o under Rs. 250 crore in FY 2016-17. Revenue foregone Rs. 7000 crore FY 18-19. 

3.	Salaried tax payers ‚Äì No changes in structure. Salaried taxpayer ‚Äì standard deduction of Rs. 40,000/- in lieu of transport and reimbursement of medical expenses. 

4.	Senior citizens ‚Äì exemption of interest income from FD / RD increased to Rs. 50,000. No TDS u/s 194A for this. Health insurance deduction from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 50,000. 

5.	Rs. 1,00,000/- deduction u/s 80DDB for critical illnesses for senior and very senior citizens

6.	Payment exceeding Rs. 10,000 in cash disallowed for Trusts. Non-deduction of TDS would be disallowed @ 30%

7.	LTCG tax ‚Äì Tax LTCG exceeding Rs. 1,00,000/- @ 10% w/o indexation. All gains upto 31.1.18 grand fathered. STCG normal 15%. Tax on distributed income by EOF @ 15%. 

8.	Increase cess by 1%. Total cess @ 4% health and education cess

9.	E assessment ‚Äì to be expanded 10% LTCG on equity returns is with or without indexation? Are we just going to ignore the FCRA amendments again? 

> 
> The government has for the second time introduced amendment to the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA) in the finance Bill, paving the way for both the BJP and Congress to escape legal scrutiny for receiving foreign contribution since 1976, the year FCRA regulations were introduced.

http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/fcra-amendment-in-finance-bill-to-help-bjp-congress-escape-scrutiny-5049589/ Remember, in UPA's government's first term last budget, they gave debt forgiveness to farmers at a national level to win elections. The fact that NDA has not given into anything like that itself is a positive.

Budget overall is ok. More exemption for salaried class is good, LTCG is a non-issue with grandfathered gains. LTCG is there in many countries, markets will factor that in. The only change should have been LTCG at 2-3 years not 1 year.

Increase in cess sucks. Do away with all these cess and rationalize tax brackets and bring more people into the tax net. Tax farmer incomes for fuck's sake. Chud Gaye phir se salaried log Your worst fear is here!

LTCG: Gains exceeding 1 lakh to be taxed at 10% without indexing Salaries of MPs, President and Governor increased! http://www.indiabudget.gov.in/ub2018-19/eb/allsbe.pdf

No allocation for the much hyped health insurance announced today. It is just the meagre same allocation for the existing UPA health insurance.  IIT Madras will work on 5g and block chain  Direct Tax growth 2017\-18 : 12.6&#37;  Nothing but Schadenfreude when seeing actual rich people claiming that they are middle-class and whining that no government does anything for them.  Gobartatti budget for the salaried middle class.  If not for the huge spending on infra,  this was like any vanilla UPA budget.  Anyone with a taxable salary more than 10 lakhs is basically fucked. So 1.6 lpm, get ready for 1.54 lpm


EDIT: Double whammy if you had ELSS mutual funds. Get ready to pay additional 10% ""ek gaav may Raghu thatha"" - Arun Jaitley, 2018.  [deleted] Maro pakad ke. Well done on the National Health Protection Scheme (5 lakh for every BPL family every year!) but please don‚Äôt implement it by linking Aadhaar to BPL Families. God knows what a can of worms that would create. A BPL card should be enough.

4% cess for income tax payers along with no change in the slabs? Wow. Also 10% tax on Long Term Capital Gains and reduced corporate tax for companies making upto Rs. 250 crores (25%). Corporations need all the deductions it seems. 

If the income tax base rose to 8 crores, could you not give some relief to them by lowering taxes? Would have gotten better tax revenues with a wider base anyway.

Again, the Government sees the middle class as the silent pony to beat around with a stick.

good from a welfarist PoV I suppose

also the 3% cess is up to 4% for a consolidated health and education tax [removed] revenue from cess will cover the healthcare coverage. if everyone believed in satan you wouldnt need this sissy healthcare.  >Real estate ‚Äì double taxation in respect of immovable property. No adjustment where 5% difference is there.

Can someone explain this? Thank you! Does new tax on LTCG imply that people will now try to ensure that they have atleast 1 Lakh LTCG / year, in order to claim max tax benefit? Rural Gujarat gave BJP the shaft while urban stayed with them, so now the govt takes the urban for granted and making attempts to please the rural.  Good Initiative for Senior Citizens!

http://www.financeminutes.com/budget-2018-for-senior-citizens-key-benefits-relief/ I work in fund management and welcome long term capital gains. Allowing people to ride secular bull runs without paying tax promotes inequality. Risk inequities is way overstates especially if you don't sell.

But the government should also remove all write offs except fully expensing capital investment for businesses and corporate.  Sensex has crashed Waiting for Pradhanmantri virginity hatao yojna. Everyone in the country to have a house by the year 2022.

Well, disappointed, but is it enough to vote for Congress in next elections? Aur gaand maar lo bhen chod. Cess increased by 1%. There is so much ignorance in this thread.

Okay first, the cess is already 3% now ... It's been 2-3% since more than 10 years ! And the cess is calculated on the tax you have to pay and not your income. NO, THE MIDDLE CLASS DOES NOT GET FUCKED BY 1% CESS ON TAX.

Second, LTCG. Let's do the math. If you're to earn 1 lakh a year as capital gains and let's say you've earned 10% return in the year, that just means you have had 10lakhs to invest in stock market.

Someone who has 10lakhs to invest in stock market IS NOT MIDDLE CLASS. Middle class in this country is worse off than Cows of this country. Atleast they have Gau-rakshaks to protect their ass After everything is announced and available can someone breakdown the budget and explain everything in layman terms? Everything that a citizen should know. Want farmers to earn 1.5 times the cost of produce of their crops: Jaitley says on the government‚Äôs promise of doubling farm incomes in five years

The government will launch a flagship National Health Protection Scheme, which will have 50 crore beneficiaries. The Centre will give up to Rs 5 lakh per family per year. This will include secondary and tertiary healthcare.

This is some big shit. kudos 1 Class Mild aur 1 Rajni Gandha total 32 Rs ka milta tha, ab kitne ka padega ? Thanks for doing this :) [deleted] Standard deduction a beneficial for employees not getting many allowances basically lower middle class or middle class.

http://www.financeminutes.com/standard-deduction-back-budget-2018-relief-to-salaried-employees/ I know this will get downvoted soon, but someone needs to put this out.
A lot of people are saying/posting here how bad it is for salaried people. I posted this somewhere else a while back, and so posting again:

**Less taxes on salaries does not necessarily mean your take home salary will increase. Companies will just pay you lower (look long term not short term). Taxes on salaries are not taxes on individuals but taxes on employers.**

Please. People need to understand it. Less taxes on salaries will just give you more money in the short term. In the long term no difference.

Edit: But seriously, **if you are gonna downvote me, provide with a rebuttal. If you can't, you are contributing to spread of lies/false-information, pretty much like online trolls.** Just that this time you are at the receiving end.

Edit2: Some people think removing all taxes from salaried class people (like done for farmers) won't increase inflation. Salaried class people paid a total of Rs 1.44 lakh crore as taxes (source: http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2018-19/news/budget-2018-standard-deduction-of-rs-40000-on-income-tax-actually-amounts-to-just-rs-10000-benefit/story/269379.html). That much more money and inflation won't increase. Good luck with that.

Edit3: I will delete this post within 24 hours. No point arguing when no one is ready to listen. :)

Edit4: Had I just worded this differently, ""Higher taxes doesn't mean less take home. Companies will be forced to increase salaries."" no one would have complained. :P

Edit5: A similar thing happened during demonitization. All salary-class people hailed Modi as God, Modi finally took the long-standing revenge of the salary-class against all shop-keepers, farmers, business owners. Masterstroke by Modi.
When I tried debating, most salary-classed were like: ""Why should I care, I pay all taxes, all my money is in banks, why should only salary-class pay all taxes?"". Now when the demonitization induced slowdown is gripping the entire country slowly, that is when they realize how brutally naive their arguments were.

Edit6: Ravish Kumar also said the middle class should not crib about the budget when there other much more important things to worry about. Here: https://youtu.be/B8dM1MGxQFw?t=16m53s Meanwhile, Congress is leading in all 3 LS seats in Rajasthan.  What is this long term capital gains tax? Is it a part of income tax or its a separate tax which I have to pay even without having any income? Could somebody ELI5 as to why middle class or salaried citizens are fucked? What were the expectations of which were not met regarding them? More tax on salaried class. Education/health cess goes up by 1 % to 4 % Thread deleted?

Harish Damodaran is a brilliant analyst, so keep an eye on him. Income tax batao yar. Bore ho gaye. The National Health Protection Scheme is more ""Obamacare"" and less NHS. Like earlier governments, this govt has also placed the onus on the private sector. 
 Right now I have a deduction of 60k for vehicles, and 15k for medical. So I'll be paying MORE taxes with the 40k standard deduction The healthcare coverage he talked about sounds splendid - up to 5 lakh rupees per annum for everyone. I wonder how it will get so much funding though. Anand Mahindra Applause!

Questions Public wants answers for -



ENVIRONMENT

Our verbal commitment to SDGs are contrary to the ground realities. Why?


We need many more NGT benches. Do we have enough competent lawyers to occupy those benches?


With the National Clean Energy FUnd now be used to compensate States for the losses due to GST, what is the Govt's plan to fund its environment and climate actions now?


Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 


Why regulations around sale and use of pet coke have been relaxed?

 
What is the status of the Waste Segregation and City Compost Policy under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan which were supposed to be taken up in 2017?


Sustainable solutions for agriculture, waste management, pollution ++ do not cost much. Why can‚Äôt the bureaucracy look at such solutions?


Why not learn from China, how it brought down pollution in Beijing during the last few years?




FARMERS AND AGRARIAN DISTRESS


Quote
Indian farmers have, for long, ensured that the country does not face any food shortage. The time has finally come for the PM to declare: ‚ÄúI am confident Indian farmers can feed the nation, I annul the Essential Commodities Act‚Äù. The most critical reform to revolutionise Indian agriculture requires no money. It requires something far harder to acquire ‚Äî learning to unlearn yesterday‚Äôs wisdom.

You ride on seaplane during Gujarat election, didn't left enough water for irrigation in Narmada dam. Why?
Today coastal Saurashtra is in submerged condition, forget about sea plane there isn't enough life savings boat, how can you afford seaplane?


Agreed the sardar sarovar dam is finished, But when will you actually complete the entire project? More than 50,000km of sub canal work is pending!


What is the status of the new crop insurance scheme? How much premiums were paid and what is the payout to farmers?


How many marginal farmers who were not earlier given loans by institutional finance been brought into institutional finance instead of loan sharks



FINANCE



Who IS the FM? 


Why the hell is Aadhaar, which was initially implemented for granting govt benefits directly to the people being used as an identity card now and being forced to link with banks and mobile numbers (Even when proved that it is not unique nor safely guarded)?

What was the actual purpose of demonetisation ? Did it yield any results? How much effective was it in combating counterfeit currency and curbing terrorism? Why does RBI takes so much time to count all the notes?
Why petrol not included in the GST?


Why Alcohol not included in the GST?


How this government understand the final effect/result of any project they rollout.(e.g Jan Dhan/ Ganga /Demonetization / etc)


Do they really care about ground reality, if yes then please tell the procedure? 


Do they have any deadline to get the feedback / Complete the process.



EDUCATION



Why was autonomous status forced down on Universities?


Do you have a good word or not on the changes brought about in Delhi schools by a different govt?


The commitment to IoE has come down from 20000cr to just 3000cr. Why?


Why is there an urgency to bring in the No Detention policy, without setting up a proper lower education infrastructure where the teachers are asked not only to teach but sent on census duty and election duty etc?'


Why is only 3% of the budget being concentrated on the education? Why haven't you shared the cess collected in the development of the schools? 


Research fellows from IIT will be paid Rs. 70000 as stipend. Why not extend this from other institutions too? For instance, JRFs are given Rs. 25k, SRF‚Äôs Rs. 28k and RA‚Äôs Rs. 35k-40k

FEDERAL DEMOCRACY


1. It is obvious that a number of states with different parties in power are doing some things right, going by the positive outcomes. Federal Democracy is here to stay. But the needs of citizens within different states are quite different. Respect regional aspirations. One size cannot fit all, ever, in India, or elsewhere.


2. Why is the gov increasingly taking democratic institutions for granted? Ex: using governor states to boss around in the administrative matter of state government. Ex: tamilnadu, new delhi, puducherry, karnataka.

 >Why has the government backed away from the EV policy? 

They haven't. There is still a large subsidy for EV's and where I live, public charging infrastructure is being tested privately on a large scale.  It's going to take time to come to all cities. But they haven't backed down at all. 

Source: I am in the EV Vehicle industry. I'm listening to him talk about job creation right now. It's literally the dumbest shit I've ever heard. He's fucking assuming that people are creating jobs for other people.

Example 1: X number of students graduated from law school. If we assume that each of them started their own practice and employed 2 people then, Y number of jobs have been created. WTF?  BECAUSE CONGRESS...NEHRU...60 YEARS...EMERGENCY...HINDU IS IN DANGER! 


^^^^^^hint ^^^^^^you ^^^^^^won't ^^^^^^get ^^^^^^any ^^^^^^answers But..but..but..but.. Hindus are in danger  So many questions but there is one answer for all of them. Nehru. 100/100. Wah Modiji Wah. Forgive my lack of knowledge, but are there any inherent problems with giving special status to a state?

Also how come demonetisation led to loss of so many jobs?

Also isnt the problems with money deposits in swiss bank is that there is no way to force swiss banks to disclose details without seriously damaging diplomatic ties? Modi's reply - Bhak saala. Bjp govt is illegally controlling Admk and TN govt. This must stop.

Kiran bedi must mind her own business in puducherry.

Mining and frackong projects of ambani and adani fraudsters must stop in TN.  Wrote NP by mistake. Fixed the flair.  Fuck him. He said 1 crore jobs were made,by some ""independent survey"" and disregarded the government figures  Kek. This is so uninformed, it is hilarious!

> 5) Rafale Deal: Is there a secret pact between France & India to not reveal the cost of defence equipment being bought?

No, the pact is in the public domain. Further, the aggregate price can be revealed, and has been. In Parliament. The details cannot. 

> Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Was it? Proof?

> 6) Doklam: Why was issue not raised during PM‚Äôs China summit (April 2018)?

It wasn't? Proof? If it wasn't, why did the statement mention ""peace and tranquility in all areas of the India-China border region""? u/kumbhakaran is an avid Parliament watcher.

He's be pleased to see this exhaustive list.

But all these count for zilch unless your MP raises them in Parliament and gets the govt to answer.

Can you write to your MP? Why does the goberment of Chindia tolerate weapons training camps of Bajrang Dal and RSS? This is waaaay too long to read in whole, but a couple of things I noticed near the top, a few questions I too want the answer to:

> 5) ... Why was contract taken away from HAL and given to a businessman?

Why should HAL get the contract by default? In fact, why should HAL exist in the first place? Why should any PSU exist? It is not the govt's job run the industry or banking or whatever. Rather, focus on privatizing the PSUs.

> 10) Why MSP not raised to 1.5 times of C2, as recommended by Swaminathan committee? (TMC MP)

Thank our lucky stars it wasn't! Why should MSP be raised? What evidence is there that increasing MSP benefits farmers? Why should there be a subsidy in farming in the first place? The focus should be on industrialization and creating blue collar jobs so that people don't have to be engaged in farming in the first place.
 There is this tiny question but carries a lot of weight. Who is the FM? Wtf is happening with the cabinet? Jaitley, Parrikar go off duty while being elected and stay invisible for months and some Tom Dick & Harry is a finance expert overnight? How is this okay? TL;DR. Where the fuck are my 15 lakhs!

Business/Finance,"So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.",28,9ypjsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9ypjsr/so_you_made_yourself_a_little_bit_of_money_huh/,11,"# So you made yourself a little bit of money, huh? How nice.
&nbsp;

All your life, all you've ever wanted, is a little bit of money. And congratulations, now you have it. Does it feel nice? Does it feel like a dream come true? Of course it doesn't. It's all just numbers on a screen, staring at you like a pathetic joke. But thanks to your thankless job, you made yourself a little bit of money. How nice.

And now, you, in all your half-decayed intelligence, have decided that you want to invest the little bit of money that you've made? Well, step right up to the raging wildfire that is the field of investing. We've got a shit-show full of stocks, mutual funds, bonds, real estate, gold and other commodities, all clamouring for your attention, and even more for your money. Done properly, you can retire into an ungodly amount of wealth. And done poorly, you can join the majority of investors setting their cash on fire, day in and day out. 

But don't feel daunted or scared. You're on the right path, and that's probably the only time you're going to hear those words in your life. Just the fact that you're thinking about investing your money puts you at a major advantage, just the fact that you've even made a little bit money is extremely rare. Look around you, what do you see? People that are so poor that they're crawling out of their tents on the roadside, people that are such douchebags that they're buying worthless bling like fur sweaters and gold chains, people that are so childish that they absolutely have to buy the latest iPhone with their credit cards, and people that are so dumb that they just can't be bothered to learn about investing. Just the fact that you're here now, thinking about investing, makes you part of an exclusive club.

Before you get ahead of yourself and feel one cent of happiness for being better off than most, let me tell you something - there's an army of twats waiting to screw you out of the little bit of money that you've made, an army of twats who wants to take away the only thing that matters to your miserable existence anymore. These are crooked relationship managers who'll sell you anything to get commissions. These are unsuspecting relatives who'll recommend terrible investments just because they don't know any better. These are seedy stock brokers who'll push schemes offering incredibly high returns that are too good to be true. These are corrupt financial advisors who'll destroy your returns, either because they're incompetent or unscrupulous, or both. You've got an entire armada of twats just waiting to snatch the money right out of your wallet. What're you going to do about that? Are you going to put your head down and hand over the cash? Are you going to run to your mommy like the little bitch that you are? No, you're going to pull out a knife and stab that little twat right in the heart. And here's how to do that, beginning with a set of basic guidelines. 

&nbsp;
##### Savings are sexy
Let's be honest, you were never made of the stuff that gave wet dreams to women. Well, here's your chance. You know what all the girls like these days? It's not that ripped chest, or that sleak jawline. It's a man who saves. Step aside AXE body spray, there's a new sheriff in town. If you're spending more than you're earning, you've got bigger problems to worry. Before anything else, you need to make sure that you're bringing in more money than you're spending. So reign in your spending, delay gratification. That burger is going to taste pretty much the same without the overpriced slice of cheese. And the movie will probably be on Netflix in a few months.

&nbsp;
##### Debt is your kryptonite
So you borrowed a little bit of money and are now stuck with the interest payments. That's okay, who hasn't done dumb stuff when they were young and full of hormones. I know I have. This one time I cleaned up an entire jar of mayonnaise thinking it was yogurt. Set some money aside every month, not just to pay the monthly minimum on your loans, but a little more so you can pre-pay all your debts. Some loans take priority over others: pay off your credit cards, personal loans and similar high-interest debt first. Keep in mind that not all loans are straight poison: those that help you develop assets like a home loan or increase future income like an education loan or business loan are alright. However, investing while carrying a high amount of debt is like playing football with one leg tied behind your back. Not exactly ideal.

&nbsp;
##### Read like your life depends on it
Stop reading WhatsApp forwards, pick up a book, and then pick another one. If you don't develop a habit of reading properly, you're going to get a lot of poop flinged at you in this business. But if you can make it through a book every once in a while, get read to fling some poop on the n00bs. You don't have to go straight for the finance section. Begin with any book that sounds interesting to you, and work your way up. Reading not only helps you understand the world around you, but also develops a better personality and temperament within you. Most of you have the patience and memory of a goldfish, and generally speaking, goldfishes are not good investors.

&nbsp;
##### Gold is old
Gold was what housewives in the 70s stockpiled in their cupboard because they had no other option. But you, you are the child of the 20th century. You actually know how to turn on the wi-fi. You have better options, like mutual funds. No matter what your uncle from the third cousin over says, investing in gold is setting your cash on fire. All it will do is make you feel good from the inside, while the eternal fireplace fuelled by your cash keeps burning in the background. Gold and silver are metals that we dig out of the ground. As an investment, they just sit there and stare at you. Just because they shine doesn't mean they're good investments. However, not everyone is convinced of this basic guideline. So if you're hell bent on investing in gold, I recommend going into the mountains and throwing yourself off a tall cliff. A medium-sized one works too.

&nbsp;
##### Insurance =/= Investing
While housewives in the 70s had gold, housewives in the 80s had LIC*. Getting life insurance is critical if you have family that depends on your income, but insurance and investing, like pizza and pineapple, never mix well. Have you ever wondered what the insurance company does after collecting your premium money? Well, the company invests your premium money in stocks and bonds, which is also what mutual funds do. So let the insurance people insure, and let the investing people invest. Separation of labour was something that the caveman figured out in 2nd century. It's time you evolved from being a caveman.

&nbsp;
##### Real estate is not real investing
The only reason for you to buy property is if you're going to be living in it. Buying real estate purely as an investment is one of the worst decisions you could ever make. Real estate: is an illiquid market (need to wait to find a buyer or seller), has high transaction costs (stamp duty and other bullshit charges), has a lot of red tape (needs several government approvals) and faces high maintenance costs (occasional cost of paint and plumbing here and there). However, every other Tom, Dick and Harry will tell you that real estate is a great investment. Why? Because real estate is how Indians signal wealth to others. It is how Indians demand respect from the *chaar log* committee. It's how we tell people that we've got a big dick, and we're not afraid to swing it around. You don't have a big dick. Tuck that little stinker back in your pants. You're just embarrassing yourself.

&nbsp;
##### Pick your poison properly
Identifying the bad investments is a greater skill than identifying the good investments. Now that gold and real estate have been vilified as bad investments, let's turn to the places that actually deserve your money - mutual funds. For the uninitiated, which includes most of you idiots, a mutual fund collects your money and invests it in the stock market on your behalf. A diversified basket of stocks in good quality companies will outperform most other investments over any time period longer than 10 years. Mutual funds can give you this diversified basket of stocks. If you haven't been living under a rock for the past few years, you've probably see the advertising campaign - *Mutual Funds Sahi Hai*. And if you have been living under a rock, stay there. We're doing great without you.

&nbsp;
##### Get yourself into a coma
The best investors, the ones who win the game in the long-term, always have patience. When you're investing in stocks or mutual funds, you need to have a minimum time horizon of more than 5 years. Any less than that, and out come the fireplaces that are fuelled by your cash. Mentally, you need to be in a place where the stock market might run off a cliff screaming into the wind tomorrow morning, and you'll still continue investing as per your plan because you're thinking about the long term. This ensures that your emotions, influenced by the ups and downs of the stock market, don't get in your own way. Ideally, you want to invest and immediately get yourself into a coma. Trust me, no one will notice that you're gone. You're one person in a world with seven billion people. You're really insignificant in the larger scheme of the Illuminati.

&nbsp;
##### Don't watch CNBC
All your life, you've only made socially acceptable choices, because you crave validation from the people around you. To your repitillian brain, approval from strangers feels better than an orgasm. But when it comes to investing, never seek validation of your choices, especially not from the pundits on CNBC. Televised business news focuses on the shortest of short terms, while you need to keep your eye on the longest of long terms. Yes, it is important to keep tabs on current events, but there are far better sources of information than the nightly news. I recommend reading Livemint and Reuters for news. Those two outfits did not pay me to endorse them, but if the PR people over there are reading this, give me a call. I accept cash, cheques and PayTM. Fuck it, I'll even take bitcoin.

&nbsp;
##### Keep It Simple, Shithead
Here is a basic plan on how to use your money when you get paid every month. First off, take care of any loans by paying off the hungry bankers who will come demanding their pound of flesh. Pay off all credit cards, in full and on time. Now, estimate how much you're going need for your monthly bills - this includes everything from your electric bill to your tab at the local bar. Deduct that amount and invest the rest of your money. When it comes to investing, begin by putting in three months of your monthly expenses in a liquid mutual fund. This is your emergency cash stash. Next up, depending on your time horizon and risk appetite, select a combination of ~3-8 mutual funds. There are a few different types of mutual funds, here's a handy rule of thumb to navigate them:
 
|                                    | High time horizon             | Low time horizon  |
|:----------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|:------------------------:|
| **Low risk appetite**  |Large-cap equity funds      |Debt mutual funds  |
| **High risk appetite** |Mid/small/multi-cap equity funds|Debt mutual funds  |
 
When you're done, set up SIPs so that you don't have to do the transfers manually each month. Every year, take some time off to review this process.

&nbsp;

This basic plan will require tweaking, depending on the context of your life. But having that plan is very important, not just for your financial life but also for the rest of your life. In the back of your mind, you've always known that. But you never followed through on making a plan, and now your life is just a series of mistakes and regrets. Is that why you drink so much? 

The lords of literature require that I write a conclusion to this piece. But this is not the end. This is the beginning of your investing journey. The basic guidelines mentioned here are intended to serve as the starting point for your own research. These guidelines are not rocket science, they are not supposed to be complicated. A person of average intelligence and awareness can reasonably expect to understand and follow them. The question is: are you a person of average intelligence and awareness? Assuming that enough of you read this, statistics require half of you to admit that you're dumb as a rock.

Always keep an eye out for the armada of twats that will try to convince you that investing is rocket science, simply so they can charge you high fees or lure you into unprofitable investments. Done poorly, you can expect a mid-life crisis magnified by a bonfire of your cash. Done properly, you can create the kind of wealth that can benefit you as well as your future generations. You've already disappointed your parents. Don't disappoint your children now.

",DexterMilburn," Is this a copy-pasta or did you actually spend time making up this...whatever this is Here's the TL;DR for people who just want the important stuff, without the bells and whistles that I have to attach just to keep your short attention span:

* If you're thinking about investing, take a moment to realize that, strictly in the financial sense, you're doing better than most people in the country.
* Be aware of the people who will try to stick you with expensive and bad investments. Not everyone is out to look for your best interests.
* Make sure you're bringing in more money than you're spending. Without any money left over at the end of the month, you've got bigger fish to fry. Mmhhmm, tasty fish.
* Make sure you've got all your loans and debts under control. After your monthly EMIs, think about setting a little more money aside to prepay. Loans with higher interest rates, like credit card loans, take priority. Borrowing money isn't bad, but not having a plan to repay definitely is.
* Pick up a book every once in a while. Start reading any book that picks your curiosity and gradually move towards more topical books on personal finance. It's good for your health.
* Don't invest in gold, or any other commodity. You've got better options than that. As an investment, gold does nothing but sit there and look at you. The exit plan is just hoping that someone will pay higher than what you paid.
* Don't mix insurance and investing. They are two different services, why would you want to mix them? By separating the two, you're making your financial life simpler and easier. 
* Only buy a house if you're going to live in the said house. Property as an investment is not liquid, aces high transaction costs, requires government approvals, faces high maintenance costs and exists without any transparency.
* Identifying bad investments is a greater skill than identifying good investments. Gold and real estate are bad investments. Stocks and bonds are good investments. Mutual funds that invest in stocks and bonds allow you to benefit from them.
* Have patience. All investing is for the long term. The stock market will move up and it will move down. Some days, it won't move at all. None of this should matter to you, because all you care about is the fact that over periods longer than 10 years, the stock market has always created a great amount of wealth.
* Don't watch any televised business news channel. They give you the news of the day. You're not worried about the day. You care about the year and the decade. For news, read newspapers like Livemint and Reuters India.
* Here's a basic plan: when you get paid, make sure you pay all required EMIs on your outstanding loans. With what is left, estimate your expenses for the month. This estimate will get better with time. Take out the money etstimated, and invest the rest. Begin with having three months of expenses in a liquid fund as an emergency fund. After than, pick 3-8 mutual funds depending on your risk appetite and time horizon. Refer table above for more information. Set up SIPs so that you can force some financial discipline on yourself. Review the plan annually.
* This basic plan will require tweaking based on the context of your life. But having that plan is important.
* Investing is not rocket science. Assuming you're individual of average intelligence and awareness, even you can do it with quite satisfactory results. Beware of people who will try to convince you that investing is like open heart surgery.

&#x200B; Really well written and a fun read. Thanks for the write up. This should be a sticky at /r/indiainvestments     * Mutual fund investments are subject to market risks. Please read the offer documents carefully before investing. I used to enjoy your Last week in economy series OP. Keep up the good work. Any plans to bring it back? Huge fan here.  Great write up, OP.

[AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate](https://nowthisnews.com/videos/politics/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-70-marginal-tax-rate-isnt-that-radical)

When we were born as a republic and our Constitution was being drafted, one of the tallest leaders of the land could foresee the problem we ail with even today. BR Ambedkar warned us about a divide and that divide was not just of caste but of rich and poor. The recent Oxfam Report on Inequality in India is a testament to that. Somewhere along the line we have failed to bridge that divide.

We have progressed, indubitably but failed to progress collectively. Poverty and hunger still ails the weakest among us. I remember watching one video of Raghav Bahl where he mentioned how India, as a mixed economy have actually got the worst of both worlds. Ours is not a **capitalist economy** and even with Indira's 42nd amendment, it isn't a **socialist economy** either.

I am not a Rahul fanboy, I supported Modi and voted for BJP but I concur with Rahul's tweet when he announces MIG and says 'we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers & sisters suffer the scourge of poverty.'

While all this is happening in India, in the west, USA, the Democrats are making a comeback, they have recently won back the House with their diverse bunch of Reps and are putting a leash on their meglomaniac President. The hotly debated topic and the eyesore for Fox News being? AOC's 70% Marginal Tax Rate on which she campaigned and won and will probably take it forward.

All these three events are happening at the same time and I do not see why we are not having this debate in India. Our divide is only growing and we cannot collectively grow until we take care of the poor and weakened ones. Here is an interesting statistic!

I do understand when you say that Ambani (or other ultra rich people) have notional wealth because it lies in stocks. This is a very capitalistic thought and factually correct but at the same time, incomplete. Ambani's wealth lies in RIL's stocks but, **STOCKS PAY DIVIDENDS**! Ambani, according to [this report](https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/mukesh-ambanis-dividend-income-from-reliance-industries-trumps-his-salary), **made Rs 14,553 crore in dividend through his stake in the company over the last 10 years** and  **Rs 1,804 crore in 2018 alone** and that with **a salary of Rs 15 crore annually**.

A rough calculation on Google's currency converter would tell you that **he can finance like two more $100 million weddings with the payout of 2018 ALONE**! So don't talk to me about the concept of notional wealth and how if he starts liquidate, RIL stocks would crash, a common and idiotic argument.

So yeah, we cannot build a new India while millions of our brothers and sisters suffer the scourge of poverty and MIG is sure as hell seems a nice idea (not talking about execution right now) and taxing the ultra rich like AOC says cannot be ruled out in India as well. This is India, we have a probe on Mars while we rank 103 of 119 countries in Global Hunger Index, the divide is real.

I am writing down all this because there **needs to be a debate** on this in India as well. The tax plan may just as well be a way to finance UBI or MIG in India but let's talk policy and make a buzz about this.

Lastly, here's a nice tweet from AOC on her idea of income inequality which I absolutely love. [Somewhere between ‚Äúteachers shouldn‚Äôt have to sell their own blood to make rent‚Äù & ‚Äúbillionaires with helipads and full-time workers on food stamps shouldn‚Äôt exist in the same society‚Äù](https://twitter.com/aoc/status/1085293594603339776?lang=en)",sultanatehere," Ohh pls...

GOI will need a separate department of International taxation to tax all the millionaires who accepted foreign citizenships... Idk why you talk of dividend income as if it's untaxed. Dividends are given after tax. Then there is also dividend distribution tax and some cess on it.  We badly need an inheritance tax as well to address the wealth inequalities.",2019-02-01 15:43:23
Business/Finance,"Due to family problems, I had to forego my college education. Now I may have the option to finally do something about that. Please advice me on how to proceed? [Long]",38,9pj0at,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9pj0at/due_to_family_problems_i_had_to_forego_my_college/,19,"Sorry this is a bit long. Tl;dr at bottom

&#x200B;

I come from a middle-class family in Gujarat, and I passed my 12th commerce from a CBSE school. I got good grades and was able to enroll in a very good college in Mumbai, and everything was going well for me. After I got my admission I went back to my hometown to prepare to move to Mumbai in a hostel, when my grandfather who was already in ill-health passed away.

&#x200B;

Now he did not have a will and most of what we owned was in my father's elder brothers name already and what was in my grandfathers name was usurped by him as well. He kicked my father out of the family business as well as made threats for us to leave the place we were staying in(It was registered to my grandpas name). This meant my own families financial status went from somewhat stable to completely in shambles. We were blindsided and that meant I had to stay and help my father weather the storm. At first I thought we'd bounce back in a month or 2 and having never known poverty I never knew ho much people struggled. But it only got worse for us. My father is an 8th pass and could not get normal jobs, so he decided to start a new business and I took a job with a friend of his due to my English skills.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

After some time passed then scumbag had us evicted as he and my aunt(bua) made some deal that she should have the house. I do not know the details of what they did but we were forced to rent a place and our already poor finances were shot to pieces. My father started to work as a salesman cause no other option and I took on a bigger role at his friends place. But things were still hard and we were barely making ends meet.

&#x200B;

I forgot all about my college and education, never going back to Mumbai after my enrollment. My family trudged along for 2 and a half years but things are changing now. My father has a childhood friend who is offering my father a good role in his business back in their old village. He is moving there and starts at first November. Now he told me that I can finally go to Mumbai and finish my college if I wanted to but I'm not even sure what to do at this point.

&#x200B;

I never went to Mumbai after my admission but this year would have been my final year. Am I still even enrolled there? They have my documents as I never collected them back. But I never paid any fees except what you pay on enrollment. My father wants me to go and try to study as he thinks his lack of education was a major reason for our family's crisis cause he had nothing to fall back on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But I don't even know if I am enrolled there anymore. The college is affiliated with Mumbai university but I could not find any details about their code on skipping exams\[By exams I mean skipping everything :( \] on google. And even If I'm still enrolled how long would it take me to finish my degree. Hell at this point I'm pondering is a [B.com](https://B.com) even worth it? My dream was to do a masters from foreign but even If I finish my degree will I get enrollment in any institute as I had these many drop years. I am really confused at this point weather to move to the village with my family or try to pursue an education.

&#x200B;

If anyone has any knowledge on how Mumbai university operates or even any advice on how to proceed please help me.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr : Scumbag uncle and aunt usurped everything and I could not attend a single day of college. Now I may finally be able to go but Idk if I am even enrolled there anymore. Please help. Any advice appreciated.",random_throwaway1579," Glad your family situation is better.  Can you call the college office during working hours and see if they are willing to look into this? 

Any degree is good. B. Com should be good if you plan a business in future or pursue further studies like MBA/CA.  Bhai get back your career on track.
The best thing you could do to support your family. How old are you now ?

What do you do for a living ?


 First, go to Mumbai right away to collect your documents from the college!

Second, take it as a fresh start. If you are not sure of B.Com, think of some other option. If you are concerned about the time wasted, you could perhaps enroll for a correspondence program from IGNOU until the next academic year? Dude, from your replies, I notice you're 20. So, first off you have time on your side - LOADS of it! That's a good thing.

Now coming to your conundrum, I understand you may be anxious to share it with some admin guy in your college.  However, if it helps you re-secure your place in the college, I'd say it's worth it. However, you have to be prepared for the worst case scenario that they may not take you back. So you gotta keep your options open.

Finally, yes [B.Com](https://B.Com). is worth it. However, IF you can do, I'd suggest doing something in Economics. If you do well in Economics, there usually are good opportunities, including scholarships for Masters. Just by 2 cents. Happy to discuss if you have any further questions. ",2018-10-20 01:09:39
Business/Finance,Is it worth moving to Canada on the basis of job opportunity at the age of 50 as an Indian Male???,22,9w2du8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9w2du8/is_it_worth_moving_to_canada_on_the_basis_of_job/,11,"I have been holding a license from IRDA, government of India as approved insurance surveyor (for collision of Automobiles) & valuator since 1990. As valuator I have been holding approved licence from other competent authority of India too.

I am Diploma Automobile, post diploma in sales management, B Tech (Mech), MBA Finance, Fellow IIISLA, Alternate dispute resolution and other professional qualifications also. I have my own proprietorship company and having office in prime location of Ahmedabad city of India. As a surveyor we get the allotment of work from insurers. As valuator we generally get the valuation work from banking sector, NBFC etc for refinance purpose of assets like cars, commercial vehicles, Engineering equipment, plant & machineries, earth movers, mining equipment etc.   

Looking to the current scenario of India-Ahmedabad. it seems that the some of the issues like inflation, population, traffic, pollution, reservation, parking issues etc are never going to be solved. They are being increased day by day. India has become of 130 cr. Mentality of certain class people are on too below level and we feel that it is never going to be changed. Business scenario is also being deteriorated due drastic and impractical changes in government policy. Political leaders are minting their own except few. As per international media India is growing but as per my experience picture of actual India is different.

For last 3 years l have been getting job offer from Canada. In 2016 from Alberta and in 2017 from British Columbia etc. I was not sincere about these offers. Taking in a view the worth uses of qualifications, experience and Looking further for better future of my sons I think sincerely this time. The offer is from St john- New Brunswick.

New Bruns wick is an Atlantic province out of total 4 provinces. St john have population of 7.50 lacs approximately. The population have been deviated in last 4 years due to some unknown reasons. I have been offered 60,00 Canadian Dollar per annum from General Insurance company of St John- New Brunswick Canada.  I will be deputed at St John only. I assume that the offer is via authentic consultant of Canada. It is to be noted that nothing is written as off now. I will have to sign the bond for 2 years for the job of said company.  As per my knowledge job profile in st john is same as India. 

The role will be as collision surveyor that is my core competence.   
I have following queries:

01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer???


02. Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.


03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence.  Are these the information appropriate???


04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??


05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.


07. Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??


08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??


09. My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?  

10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???


11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??


12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?


13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Please share any other information which are useful.",chaxulpandya," > 01.At the age of 50 is it worth ACCEPTING offer??? 

depends on what kind of life you are aiming for. there are trade-offs involved when you immigrate, so you need to look at the big picture. it's not just a financial decision, but one that involves your family, future generations, cultural changes, weather/climate changes, etc.

&#x200B;

> 03. Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate??? 

Please go through the NB PNP website in great detail. Read through the entire website and the application guide, etc. Do not just trust what the consultant is telling you. The canadian immigration process is quite transparent- the process is well outlined so everything you need to know will be on their website, including forms, documents required, fees, etc. Also, from the website, it seems that NB is not accepting applications for PNP currently.

&#x200B;

> 04. What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

again, go through the NB PNP website. you'll find all the information there

&#x200B;

> 05. It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed??? 

I'd suggest you pose this question in a canada immigration or legal community. In my opinion, such bonds are not enforceable in Canada, but i'm not a 100% sure

&#x200B;

> 06. I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer. 

Cleaner air, less crime, better work life balance, higher respect for life, effective government/ public administration systems, tax dollars that actually work and benefit residents

&#x200B;

> 08. Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security?? 

not sure what this certificate is but again, please go through the NB PNP site in detail. that will tell you what you need and do not need

&#x200B;

> 10. Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.??? 

most big cities in the maritimes have indian stores and restaurants. you will be able to find most spices and ingredients, but you probably won't be able to replicate your culinary preferences a 100%

&#x200B;

> 11. Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier?? 

Please search ""canada express entry"" in google. that seems to be a popular PR channel these days

&#x200B;

> 13. My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources. 

There are a number of options, so depends on what you're looking for. Also, i doubt if any city in canada has ""pleasant"" weather. Vancouver is probably the only city that has a slightly bearable winter.

&#x200B;

To summarize, i would say to read the NB PNP website and express entry website in detail. as i mentioned, do not just trust what the consultant is saying. do your own due diligence.

&#x200B; Kem chho Pandya kaka... I will try to answer your concerns. My background: I was 15 when my father immigrated to Canada from Vadodara.

Here are my responses:

> Dollar 60,000 is suitable amount or I should negotiate? If alone or with family?? Dependent are wife + 15-year old son.

$60,000 should give you savings (even with wife + son), but you should negotiate. Your fixed costs each month would be: rent, groceries (food), travel/commute, phone etc. For rental rates, check kijiji.ca. Groceries can be $400-500. Travel I'd say up to $200. Phone could be easily $200-$250 for 3 people. 

> Currently I will be offered a work permit. I will be able to file P.R. after 6 months i.e. for me, my wife and my 15 years old son. The compulsory stay required in N.B. is 1000 days for getting Permanent Residence. Are these the information appropriate???

Work permit and then PR sounds about right. Not sure about accuracy of the information. Try canadavisa.com forums and ask there, it is a very active community.

> What may be the expenses to be borne by us i.e. visa fees, any other fees etc.??

If you are being offered a job, the company should be taking care of any visa fees. They should even reimburse you if only the applicant is allowed to pay the visa fees by CIC. Clarify this with the company before accepting the offerf.

> It is very difficult to adjust with cold weather of st john. Due to health issue related to weather, if we are not able to stay there after 2-3 months than how bond will be executed???

I don't think companies have bonds in Canada. You can usually leave work in 2-4 weeks notice (as per terms of employment). And companies can do the same, they can let you go with the same notice. I'd recommend starting in summer so it is easier for you to adopt to the weather

> I will have to leave my social life, family life, business and some notional benefits too. What can be the advantage of Canada if I accept the offer.

Benefits:
- /u/das_halifax did a good job summarizing.

> Are any specialised engineering study institutes/universities being there for part time study??

Not sure. If you don't find much, let me know and I'll do some research for you.

> Is the No objection certificate from wife is required as a part of process if proceeding alone for few months??? Or they demand it as extra security??

Absolutely not. No NOC required from your job's wife for you to go.

> My son is studying in 10th Standard. Is it advisable to complete study up to 12th in India or he should study there?

 Best bit for you is your son is in a perfect age to hit a jackpot. As I said, I was 16 when we immigrated. Best thing is that Indian high school system is rigorous while in Canada, high school is a breeze (comparatively), while universities are a significant jump in difficulty. At your son's age, he will get a significant advantage as he would already know much of the content in Maths and Science that is taught here in Grade 11 and 12. But he has to grab the opportunity as well. If I were in India, the best I would have thought of was LD college of engineering, or MS University of Baroda, yet I was able to do Engineering from University of Toronto, which is better than any IIT. Keep in mind that he has to grab the opportunity. I had plenty of Indian friends, but almost none of them took the opportunity. I had done 11th standard in India, and had to do 11th and 12th again here. If your son studied in Gujarati medium, he might have to work hard initially. I was in English medium. If he studies all the way until 12th in India, a downside is that now Canadian universities don't know how he measures up against local applicants, and now he might be competing against International applicants. So, better if he is part of Canadian high school system before 12th. (He will likely have to give IELTS (academic module)/TOEFL regardless, btw).

> Is Indian food available in St-John N.B.???

Every small town in Canada has it. But no guarantees that you'll like the taste. Often, Indian restaurants in remote towns cater to taste buds of white people than Indians. A tradeoff of not living in Toronto, I guess.

> Are there any other provisions to get the P. R. earlier??

Try express entry. Check [CRS tool](http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/crs-tool.asp) and see how much you score. As of Oct 2018, people with score of 442 were granted PR.

> 12 My elder son is of 22 years. How can I sponsor him other than student Visa?

Please don't go for student visa. You have the right thinking. People come here with admission in any random college. In Canada, college = diploma, university = degree. If he has done bachelors, and working, best bet is for him to get 2-3 years of experience and apply through express entry (try CRS tool for him as well). I know someone who immigrated recently at age of 25 and is doing pretty good. PR from day 1 and none of the struggles that people who come on student visa go through.

I don't think you can sponsor him. He has to apply by himself as he is already 21. He may get additional points if you are a PR/citizen, but not sure. You'll have to confirm with the CRS link above.

> My ultimate goal is to settle in Canada with family in pleasant weather province. Please suggest place or another possible sources.

Pleasant weather? Vancouver. But it also rains a lot in Vancouver in summer. Still better than having snow in other parts of Canada though. Vancouver is crazy expensive to live in though, because of chinese black money in real estate. Second, I'd put Toronto. Less snow than other parts of Canada, and even cities like Ottawa, Montreal. Toronto is expensive as well, but Toronto suburbs should work out well.


Concluding thoughts:
- It is a big change to move at age of 50. As you said, you are resetting your social, family life, and business. At this point, you are moving for the sake of your son than yourself. *If it was just you and kaki, I wouldn't recommend immigrating.*
- Please consider the fact that you are also subjecting your wife to a completely new environment, with no relatives around. There are a few Gujaratis in NB now (Moncton, Fredericton etc) but most are international students, so not sure how you'd relate.
- Call me emotional, but it still haunts me that my future generations won't be able to communicate with me in Gujarati if I remain in Canada the rest of my life. Not that they won't know how to, but they won't be comfortable. In 2-3 generations, the language will be wiped out from your family. Also, same thing about good values that might be unique to India. I am still not at peace with this, and am planning on returning back in a couple of years.

PM me if you'd like to discuss more. We can chat over WhatsApp if you'd like. You make the decision, but I can make you aware of all the realities based on the experience I'v gathered here in more than a decade, and that might help you make the decision. Your salary is quite low man, even for N.B. Since you are going with a teenage son, who will enter college, your wife will have to work otherwise you won't be happy at all. Incredibly paltry salary, and there are very few opportunities available in St. Johns for getting higher salary than this. That place has very high unemployment rate. Sort this aspect out, rest everything will fall in place.  I'd advice you to post this in r/canada and r/abcd as well. You might get better answers there. Having traveled to both countries.  100000 times yes 50 is 25 in Canada. You are quite the young man, sir. Good luck. r/iwantout What are you waiting for? As long as you have done homework on validating the PR in 6 months claim, what do you have to lose?  Stay there for 5 to 7 years, become a citizen, get your son a decent shot at life in Canada and if you don‚Äôt like it go back. You have worked till 50 and obviously Ahmedabad has not given you what you are looking for otherwise, you would not be thinking about leaving at this stage of life. 

As someone who left India at the age of 17, trust me when I say you will be giving your son the biggest gift any parent can give a child- a gift of choice. 

I say go ahead and don‚Äôt look back. Negotiate everything but don‚Äôt look back.  Bhaiyya kitni baar bahar gaye ho? Culture shock na ho jaye kahi sare aam chumma chaati karte logo ko dekh karüòÇ

And the society there is different. So be prepared that Indian way of thinking needs to be changed. 

Weather will be extremely cold compared to gujarat.  It's not worth it. You shall suffer from the lack of food, a familiar natural environment, social life et cetera. Really not a good decision.",2018-11-11 22:23:29

",-0-1-," Thanks!! [deleted] Good job. Thanks for sharing OP. This needs to be upvoted more. holy cow...i'll have to tldr.
This is what's gonna happen when you pair poor computer literacy, lazy programmers, old cyber infrastructure , fake pateriotism and lack of will for security of public.  We need a wikipedia page for AAdhaar leaks . There are so many of them .  [removed] Thanks a lot man. I have such links just in case I need to slap something my friends with and I don't have it. Having so many of them on a topic at one place is a lot of help. 

Someone should make a list of all fuck ups of modi.  God damn. fuck.   How can I help? I am an experienced web developer.

Perhaps an interactive site or forum or both. People might like to explore this too: r/antiaadhar had to scroll 5 times to get bottom of this! That's a lot of work.
Thnx brah Thanks, this is much needed. Aadhar is being misused by the govt in big way. Does anyone maintain a google drive to store all news articles related to adhaar? Saved Wow ! Top quality content OP! this should be stickied Holy fuck!! [removed] cool Articles can be deleted from websites, no?

We should save it as PDFs! Yes thank you man. This is just what I was thinking about that if someone ever asks for proof about shittyness of Aadhar, this is it. Even the UIDAI would shut their mouths. You the real nigga! ü§òüèª Nice u/-0-1-

Thank you for this social service.

May the blinds see it clear. Is there a way to make this list so that it is  the headlines  hyperlinked to the website. Will make the list more shareable online that way as it will be more readable. I only know of a manual way to do it. Ok",2018-03-25 20:33:38
Business/Finance,India and its States: some states are too much populated to govern efficiently,6,9zgjc8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/9zgjc8/india_and_its_states_some_states_are_too_much/,4,"Hello everyone, let's discuss about our states. We all know that some of our states are too populated to govern efficiently. However, creation of so many smaller states is very difficult. So, we need Autonomous Regions (AR).

For example, UP has close to 200 million people. There are only four countries on earth with more population than UP ! Even Maharashtra and Bihar had 100 million plus people in 2011. West Bengal had more than 91 million in 2011 too. There are only 13 countries on earth with 100 million club. The US state with highest population is California (39 mil), we have 11 states with more than that.

So, it seems that for better serving the populace we need states with lesser population. State governments tend to keep all power in the hands of a select few leaders and thus failed to spread development evenly around the state.

However, dividing our states into smaller one would be very problematic. It would create political shit storms and turmoils so powerful that no central government would withstand that. Just see what happened during the creation of Telengana. 

So, the better solution would be dividing states into semi-autonomous regions. There are 14 such regions already exist in India like Gorkhaland, Bodoland, Kargil, Ladakh etc.

Bigger states should be divided into a few autonomous regions (AR). It would have its own local governments with limited powers.

The AR's could be like that:

1) Population below 10 millions except the Metropolis AR's like Mumbai, Kolkata etc.

2) The local government of the AR should be formed via Panchayet and Municipal elections by their elected members. Another extra election should be avoided.

3) These AR's should have powers and funds for village and town developments, local road constructions, sanitations, health cares, school education, waterbody and forest conservation, tourism development, industrial developments, land and land reforms etc.

4) The state government will control the police, judiciary, state civil services, higher educational institutions, state highways etc.

5) The state government and the central agencies will collect the taxes. The ARs would collect some local taxes like tolls, small business license fees etc. The tax revenues would be distributed among the AR's, state governments and the central government by the rules of the finance commissions.

6) The AR's would have limited legislative powers which would enables them to pass some laws. However, they would be under the legislative authority of the state.

7) So, there could be more than hundreds of such AR. Every metro city city should form its own AR.

Let's debate.
",bikbar1," I didn't read the whole thing cause I'm super sleepy but larger states must be broken, especially UP. It's easier to govern, it's easier to decentralise the power one or a few states hold in national elections, and it gets easier to carry out govt welfare programmes and other schemes, and people can be equally have a larger voice when it comes to holding the system accountable. Also, faster rates of growth, education, gender equality etc etc. Playing the devil‚Äôs advocate: is there any analysis to prove that administrative efficiency is directly proportional to size of state? I know it seems intuitive, but is that the only factor we should consider? What are the factors that are really holding back growth on our states? If every thing else remained constant and we only reduced the size, would we see a better result?",2018-11-23 07:53:53

Business/Finance,Is Modi making Corruption systemic?,428,7c6kh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7c6kh8/is_modi_making_corruption_systemic/,177,"With the recent developments in the Supreme court, RBI after demonetisation, The media channels brought by BJP, The Finance bill which give political parties access to benaami funding. He is making the 0.001% at the top above law, almost god-like. This includes the business tycoons, senior most officials in the government, Ministers

EDIT:Wow getting down-voted without a debate on this. keyword Modi is trigger for downvoting?",angrybong," Modiji understands the IQ of Indian society very well , sell them dreams and victim complex - Rule forever :)  [deleted] [removed] [removed] [removed] Is that benaami donation clause honestly in the ""finance"" ""bill"" that got squeezed through LS? Feels like people have kind of moved on from that particular fuckery.

Edit: a word >developments in the Supreme court,


Heights of desperation. Nobody has literally any control over the supreme court. It is the most opaque arm of our state, always has been. Stop blaming random shit on modi, your entire argument loses value because you pull shit like this. Can't believe people just automatically upvote anything anti modi without even reading the BS in the post. So it wasn‚Äôt since the time of Indira Gandhi?

Modi is the result of the bullshit spawned by Congress over the years. Now, we have the other side corrupting the system to suit their agenda.

I don‚Äôt like Modi but I hate Congress worse.  The same SC CJI ruled in favour of AAP govt. in the LG- AAP turf war. 
And why are you blaming Modi, SC judges are appointed by collegium, not our PM Yes, there are several videos and reports which are not from the left per se. its even from centerists who argue this.

Also, you forgot Electoral bonds, which is completely annonmyous way of paying a party.

What factions usually do is try to remove blame from Modi, and pin in on the pre-existing system, absolving the leadership of everything. This is a problem because, the leaderships' inaction, rather...its tweeks to more streamline the process, is in cahoots with the pre-existing system of corruption.

Technically, the present government has not done as much damage as previous ones, but small steps it has taken to legalize corruption, will lead our nation to further ruin.

I am sure that's what our founding fathers would have wanted - ""My father, let my country be led to ruin"" (/s) Generally I think that the more autocratic a government is the more corruption flourishes. This is because fewer people have more power (and so can do bigger scams) and because they face less risks of repercussions. I read somewhere that corruption in India really kicked off with Indira Gandhi, precisely because she was the first leader to centralise a lot of power in just her close advisors/allies Corruption has been a hallmark of indian businesses and politicians way before modi, its like part of its culture and fabric of scoiety that corruption has to exist for things to run at all.

Even some people told me that without corruption, things cant function at all in india, it just depends on whether its big or small. Yeah, it was evident long ago. He's mastered the art of normalizing corruption. They don't even have to hide it. That's why you don't hear about any scams at all these days. If you don't find a view correct please put counter arguments. Downvoting only shows your confirmation bias. Yes. It's pretty good. But I'm hoping with more years in power,I'm hoping they don't make it a competition between people on the ground like the Congress did. Being a Modi supporter I always believed that Modi is doing grate thing for our future. But from past 6 months show different result and different future. Modi made Black money go away as he promised but in process of making policy of making black money harder, he just made making black money a legal and tax paying. Due to the policy other people were Abel to increase profits margins which eventually lead to high rate of products and an increase in dearness. Now due to GST and other policies all the product are almost double in price. Yes, that's the Gujarat model. More money reaches up, less remains for down guys Is 'systemic' appropriate in this case? Isn't it supposed to be more of a biological/medical term? 

Can some vocabulary nazis help out ? I think Modi is doing good job and people know that and appreciates him and thus is voting more and more BJP.

#AccheDinForeva I would happily blame PM Modi for this but corruption has been the system in developing world long before he got the top job. He is making both corruption and genocides systematic  [removed] But....He is making Sardar Patel and Lord Ram statues. He is doing things as per kulcha.

Business/Finance,Some Gyan for aspiring MBA students about which no one will bother to talk,58,84vvjc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/84vvjc/some_gyan_for_aspiring_mba_students_about_which/,81,"I am 2013 MBA pass out. 

I am surprised to see so much misplaced expectations and ignorance among MBA aspirants.

I am currently working as a researcher at a think tank that evaluates quality of management education.

So, according to me, here is some general gyan -

Unless you are from top 25 B School in India, your MBA / PGDM is absolutely worthless job wise.

Private B Schools ranked outside rank 25, are only interested in your ""money"". 

Students joining outside 25 rank Private B Schools will face these hardships -

(1) Placement process will be non-transparent, skewed to benefit favorites of the institute, very few good companies.

(2) Lack of summer placements. 

(3) Some even fudge their placement figures.

(4) Average salary declared is almost always untrue.

(5) 100% placement never happens.

(6) Favoritism based on chamcha giri is rampant, you will get better grades/placement based on that.

(7) You will come across relatives or friends of the founder of the private B School posing as ""Faculty"". 

(8) Alumni networking will be non-existent. 

Also, Business Analytics is a new MBA major specialization being offered with traditional Finance/Marketing/HR. 

It makes sense to opt this from job perspective.",Tam-Brahm," Just want to add to the discussion here. I'm a 2018 pass out from one of the new IIM's (set up in 2011) and the picture is not too rosy. If you have expectations of a 12lpa+ package after graduating from an IIM, there are only a few (about 30% of the batch) who have got that.  Placements are very shady and often students are forced to apply to companies which are not even heard of. Our placement process started in Nov, and there are still double digit students left to be placed with our convocation soon.

On the plus side, there is a lot to learn from studying in top 20 B-schools as the alumni interaction and pedagogy is good. All I'm emphasizing on is that the immediate reward of an extremely good job in terms of ROI and role is non-existent in the newer IIM's. What are the top 25 institutions? Seeing the state of top mba colleges ,I'd say top 20 are best. Other than that ,it's useless doing an MBA 

Many of my friends did engineering then immediately mba and now earning 6-7-8 lakhs per annum after spending 6 lakhs for two years ,doesn't make any fucking sense RoI, and brand name play a major role when it comes to do an MBA. I agree with OP to the point that this case of high competition, rat race and missed opportunities exists even among top 10 colleges of the country. Thus, if you are planning to do an MBA, go ahead only if it suits your profile or your expected career progression, and not just because everyone is doing it.  Thanks for posting this - people need to know the kind of fraud MBA education is in many colleges. 

My friend was the secretary of the owner of some private institutions who owned some B and C grade schools and colleges. They decided to start an MBA college and built one fancy looking building within another campus of their college. They were not affiliated with anyone and offered a post-graduate diploma in something-something-MBA. (Note that they are not affiliated to anyone and this diploma is just a worthless piece of paper).

They were having a tough time attracting candidates and one day the CEO asked my friend, her secretary to go and find out what the issue was. He went there during the admission seasons and also joined in with the supporting staff. He managed to convince 12 students to join the institute. The CEO immediately made him the Admission officer for the institute. The next year, the second batch under him got 32 admissions.

The fees in the first year was 8 lakhs and the second year had been hiked to 10 lakhs! 

(After the 2nd year, my friend requested a ""transfer"" to an engineering college so that he wouldn't feel guilty about how he was literally cheating people to do an ""MBA"" that had no value at all.) Where did you do your MBA from, OP? Is Christ University Bangalore any good ? How would you rate the Indian School of Business? CAT 18 aspirant here(not serious as per now), currently studying in an average engineering college. 

80% chances that I will be placed in a mass recruiting company. 

MS from abroad or MBA from India, as a fresher.? Don't downvote, ik both of them are completely different but my aim is to get a good package and a better life (the reason abroad). I belong from a middle class family but parents are ready to spend around 40lakhs for education. Hows fore and symbiosis? Which was your MBA institution?  [deleted] How's SCMHRD? Asking for my sister who's planning to do MBA this year  Just a clarification, what constitutes top 25 though?

Rankings in India are very different in different systems. I'd say the Old IIMs come first, then MDI, XLRI, FMS, IIFT & SPJIMR. Some IITs are also in the top 25. Any particular list to follow? You can read this article .....

A big thank you to all good Samaritans of r/India for their advice and feedback.

I am the ""friend"" mentioned in the original post.

My friend has given me access to this reddit account after seeing the response.

I experienced outright rejection during my recent MBA entry level job interviews due to my situation.

I was depressed, angry and confused about my future.

I was very skeptical if r/India could really help me out with my situation.

But all your feedback and suggestions, have given me a new hope.

**Original Post by my friend:**

Law graduates of r/India, Please share your views on this :

My close friend is a cancer survivor.

He is 36 years old. 

He has these two career options in mind -

(1) Whether he should get back into IT industry as he has 4.5 year's of coding experience in C#. If yes, what steps.

and

(2) Whether to pursue law as his MBA Finance has given him good exposure to Mergers And Acquisitions (M&A),  Business laws and Taxation.

I am asking your help/advice/suggestion for Query No (2) i.e, He wants to study law at the age of 36 years.

He is appearing for these law exams in 2018 -

CLAT, IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam and DU LLB exam.

He says that there is no age limit for studying law and practicing law. 

Is there any merit to it ? (I don't know anything about careers after law education.)

His family supports him wholeheartedly, but they need clarity on how exactly can pursuing LLB law education help my friend at the age of 36.

Please, Please upvote for visibility.

Edit:

Being a cancer survivor, my friend was unemployed close to 3-4 years during his cancer treatment.

Recently, he secured a part time decent teaching job that can become full time.

His family is unhappy that he will resign from his present job, which he secured through lots of effort against all odds.

So, Is there any merit in his decision to take up law education at this age.",Tam-Brahm," I know multiple people with MBAs and PhDs who did an LLB in their 30s and 40s to start consultancies in various business related fields. None of them are practising lawyers but doing the course opened a lot of doors in terms of career opportunities. It adds a lot to your profile, depending on what field you're trying to enter. Benefits greatly in finance, investing and startup entrepreneurship consulting.

IMO it's a great move. Luckily for your friend, this is the first year that CLAT has no age limit after the supreme court made a verdict that said so. He might have to get used to all other students being half his age! lol On a slightly different note. Such a question would've been unthinkable in a developed country. This is one area I'm genuinely envious of. There should be no prejudice about age when it comes to learning. 

I hope he does go ahead and studies. We don't have enough people actually willing to study.  > IIT-Kharapur's LLB entrance exam

IITs have Law programs too, now ? I did llb around 10 yrs back, not practicing. I had a classmate 60+, only reason he did was because he wanted to ""learn more"". Very nice person, he once fought with traffic police as his car was towed from legal parking area. Traffic constable brought back his car, and said sorry to him. 

Llb 3 years course is for those holding graduation. 5 years for 12 pass. Attending classes is compulsory if you are in good college and no one cares in many others, I had 4% in my second year. So attending evening or full time should consider the college he gets admitted too.

While studying and reading the cases is very interesting, practicing would mean spending many years with zero to very low income. Many of my friend still makes less than 10k a month. This is where top law school matters. If you are graduate of such place then getting into good law firms get easy.

I believe everyone should do Llb. No matter what you do it helps to know the law. DU law admits people only upto 30 years of age

Not sure about the IIT it doesnt have a great rep though, a law school needs years of establishment to have good faculties. Most of what Ive heard about IIT law course was the teaching is terrible  If he has ample financial reserves in the form of alternative income/rent/ancestral property, it can be a very good option. Only the very few in India can truly dedicate themselves to litigation without running after money. On the other hand if you think of making money from Law after entering it at age 36, you are likely to be disappointed.

Easy and quick money in Law is only in Transactional Law (i.e. drafting up agreements/affidavits/documents and registering them etc.) and in consultancy/advisory (eg: being on a businessman's negotiating team while he/they negotiate an agreement/merger/tie-up with a potential partner).. Transactional practice can be independent/self-employed as well, infact most low-level low-skilled independent lawyers make money through drafting agreements of leave and license, rather than appearing before a Court. You can make 30-35 K per month from drafting rent agreements and affidavits, you can barely hope to make 15 K per month from fighting cases in court. Even the better known Law Firms in Mumbai do not offer their freshers 30-35 K p.m. as starting salary.

An area in Litigation is indeed profitable but it is cornered by the niche profession of **Solicitor Firms.**   Few solicitor firms will agree to recruit someone at 36 years of age. 

The best thing is someone who owns huge profitable land/rent independently practising Law in the Courts, i.e. actually pleading before a Court. Thats how the profession used to be in Pre-Independence India. Why should there be any age limit to study. Ageism is part of casteism. I guess, there is no age limit for learning.

*For preparation of CLAT, u may suggest this free CLAT mock test site - https://www.cybermocktest.com/clat/*  If he already has masters degree why doesn't he just take a NET exam and teach? Law undergrad student from NLU Patiala, here.

I‚Äôm sure your friend has a graduation degree, so I will not suggest going for CLAT, since it is particularly for a 5 year course which is integrated course pursued by students after their 12th. The variants of these courses depending upon the NLU are BA. LL.B(hon), B.Sc. LLB, BBA LLB. etc.
5 years for a course is too much, when he can successfully pursue a 3years LL.B. degree. I will suggest checking out BVP Pune, BHU, etc.
It‚Äôs a much better utilisations of his time and resources too, given that a five-year course is very intensive with compulsory attendance and 2 lacs in fees in a year (approx.) if you consider the NLUs and other top colleges.

I would recommend a 3year course from a reputed state university over 5 year course through CLAT.
 Never too late for education and starting afresh aiming for a goal.


He'd just need to keep the eligibility criterias in check. May I know which city your friend is based out of?  In my time at law school, I have seen 40-50 somethings sitting with us 20 year old kids. 

Good thing about law is, it doesn't have age limits and or any retirement age. Some state bar councils do have 45 year age limit, I am not sure if it was challenged in court, but that's a non-issue. 

It can be a task to learn nuances and practicalities of legal practice when you're 30 plus but it's not a challenge big enough to be a roadblock for him to take up law.

Best of luck to your friend  I study in a CLAT affiliated institute. We have never had anyone his age study here. Thats because CLAT institutions don't have a 3 year LLB course. We only have a 5 year BA LLB course or a BBA LLB course. So he'll have to shift to another city for 5 years and go to class everyday with 17-18 year olds. Ask him not to give clat and research about colleges which give the LLB degree alone. For that, he should already have 
a graduate degree like BA, BSc or BBA. Many factors need to considered:


He will feel the age gap a lot, especially if in a 5 year program but also in some 3 year programs since many students join straight after college. The exception to this is probably DU and GLC, mumbai. The reason for that is attendance is not an issue and DU still has evening batches. These attract older candidates who are working during the day and also UPSC aspirants who have law as a back up. Your friend will find it easier to gel with the crowd at such places. 


Your friend might be able to continue working while studying. Even more so if it‚Äôs a teaching job and it‚Äôs part time. Those can be kind of chill and he is already working there, so cancer-based discrimination may be low. 


Regarding placements: HR recruiters will want cheap workers with no baggage. Hence, ageism crops up. Law schools (all colleges for that matter) are factories and unfortunately, your friend will be an outlier. He is highly experienced in diverse fields. This is bad and good. Recruiters won‚Äôt know what to do with him or he will get a offer appropriate for a 21 year old. It can be good if he finds a job that values his experience in B.Tech, MBA etc but that takes a lot of hustling to find. Yet he will have to explain 4 years of unemployment. Truth is, his classmates will be safer bets and his getting recruited through the formal placement process will be tough. 


Litigation stream is always an option. It‚Äôs slow work in the beginning but he‚Äôd be self employed or in a small firm.


Him being a cancer-survivor, if I were in his shoes, I‚Äôd opt for a college with chill attendance, continue with the teaching. Write the LLB exams. Build up contingencies for a cancer relapse (good insurance, access to healthcare, savings). Then carry on with life with the above priority (job with health benefits, low stress) and try to be happy. 

TLDR: technically, age is no barrier. Still, it‚Äôll be tough. He should consider part-time and retain his day job. It is doable. Cancer changes everything. Relapse is a risk that he will have to mitigate always. [deleted]",2018-03-24 03:16:03

1. Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. To claim that Kerala is high on HDI purely from post-independence governments is a bit of a stretch; they started out with a relatively compact population (13.5m in 1951) and the most advantages among states, thanks to the focus on education by the local dynastic precursors, the Travancore Family, along with contributions with subgroups like the Nair Society and Christian Missionaries.

",pure_haze," Damn you OP, I was expecting some mallu models

(„Éé‡≤†Áõä‡≤†)„Éé Regarding the high crime rate in kerala: 

https://youtu.be/2EH6OWMUCnI

You may skip to 3:45 Every state has dependence on something. I just think that Kerala does the right things with their money. The risk associated with this source is questionable but the money itself is used in improving HDI and not just 'bijness' related indicators.

Their economy and employment is dependent on three things mainly - tourism, gelf and Bangalore. Maybe their next target itself is to reduce this dependency.

The debate is very nuanced with guys like Bhagwati and Sen arguing the merits of Gujarat and Kerala models. With economics, there are no right answers. It's just whatever works.

Now let's take the other extreme - Haryana. The economic indicators are off the charts. But people still hold onto their outdated beliefs and some parts of the state also has law and order problems and is regarded unsafe for women. Now is this development and is it sustainable? >Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%. 

And why was so UP being in Ganga belt had historically been a rich place of poor people . Kerala had better indicator at independence bcoz it had  and has better society . And still today UP is a highly divided society .


For Japanese miracle and their industrialization , their homogeneity and social structure played an important foundation part  As a Keralite, I find the chest thumping to be a ridiculous show-off at best and the communist revisionism to hijack all the achievements at the worst. We will be facing dire issues when the middle-east slows down significantly. I personally know so many young men pinning their futures on some small job in the gulf. 

Trade unions must be reigned in and the ease of doing business has to improve. It won't happen overnight, but that will be the greatest thing the current left government can do and only a left government can do.

I really wish there was a way for me to return to my hometown. As of now, the only way I can sustain my current income if I move back is to go freelance, and that is being optimistic. To be fair, a govt can do investment in social welfare without being communist. Just look at what Mamata Banerjee is doing in Bengal, despite me hating her, she has done some good work in mgnrega, improving the hospitals from their dismayl state, and overall improving rural infrastructure. 

The fiscal deficit and high debt you mentioned was common in communist govt of Bengal too. When the Left left, we had a high debt of over 1.5 lakh crore, and the current govt is not doing anything either to reign it. 

My main issue with Kerala model is that it can't be implemented anywhere else. It works for them, good, but we need some other way to lift other states. I like breaking big states to smaller, and then working on them. Likewise, we can produce replicas of Goa which have decent social infrastructure as well as good enough ease of doing business to lift people up.  One of the less spoken advantages of Kerala is that most of its population is either in the cities or live in close proximity to cities. I believe factors like high HDI and low IMR are because of this. 

But regardless of what brought about its high development, I think the Kerala model cannot be adopted by rest of the states. If we are looking to emulate, I guess the Tamil Nadu model of socialism has proven successful. TN may not be Kerala, but is often #2 or #3 on most counts. Again, one advantage that TN has/had that a state like UP does not is that Madras has been a prominent administration city since pre-independence. But I think any benefits from that are minimal at the moment.  Radicalization is a problem in Islam itself. I don't think the rates of radicalization are more in kerala in comparison to an equivalent Muslim population of that number elsewhere.  Do you have a source for this? While OP is raising legitimate points about Kerala‚Äôs economy, you seem to be missing the whole point about Kerala model. 

Kerala model is that It has achieved very high material Quality of life/human development indicators, despite being A low income state.

The reason it is called a model is because it is unique. Pretty much everywhere else in the world economic growth and quality of life or Human development go hand-in-hand but strangely Kerala Managed to improve material quality of life with little economic growth.

By arguing that Kerala‚Äôs economic growth track record may be considered abysmal, though a fair point, you are only reinforcing the concept of Kerala model.

Nobody calls Kerala an economic miracle, everybody knows it is not. 

Is it a replicatable model? Maybe not. Is it the key to solving the problems across the country? Definitely doesn‚Äôt seem like it. 

Has historic circumstances contributed? Perhaps. But historic and geographic reasons also limits its economic potential too. So that is argument that cuts both ways. 

Now, i would say it is facetious to argue that the outcomes have solely been due to the gulf boom, Because the impact of the gulf boom on Kerala really began only in the late 80s. 

Kerala Declared hundred percent literacy in the early 90s, which would not have been possible without strong government policies over the years. 

Also some of the places with most gulf NRIs, such as Malappuram, are actually some of the most backward areas in Kerala.  


And to give credit to the Travancore royal family is laughable, because if that were the case then many regions in Southern Tamil Nadu today was part of the  erstwhile Travancore kingdom. While, parts of the Travancore kingdom that is in Kerala have done extremely well, parts that are with Tamil Nadu have yet to catch up. Also Travancore kingdom is probably covered less than 30% of modern Kerala. 

It is very clear that the most significant government policy that laid the foundation for this transformation was the massive wealth redistribution program launched by the first Kerala government, which was a communist government. 

So, what has the Kerla model achieved? Fewer children are dying, fewer mothers are dying, there are fewer illiterate people. More and more people are getting skilled, hence are able to find higher paying jobs, albeit, elsewhere. I would argue that we are yet to yield dividends of Kerala model. 

So, yes it is a model. Is it the best model? it is hard to say. Has it its own advantages? Oh yes definitely. 
 The riot cases are high because almost everything is registered and reported.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokku_kooli

One of the most ridiculous things I have ever heard of. *Upvotes*

*Grabs popcorn*

**Let the games begin.** I think best things that happened to Kerala were, Progressive Travancore state, Early Communist government and lots of christian missionaries.

Christian missionaries and Progressive Travancore state meant that the state had a robust education system. providing for a progressive and good labor base for development. 

Communist govt took land from absentee landlords and redistributed land among landless laborers. Also, brought social parity by working against caste system. Social parity is very much a prerequisite for economic growth. Kerala achieved is much earlier than others.

State couldn't take full advantage of it's lead, but remittances or not, it did have a headstart on other states in early independence days. > 2. Unemployment rate: Despite the dependence on remittances and foreign jobs, the state‚Äôs unemployment rate is 12.5% against the all-India level of 5%, making it the third highest in the country after Sikkim and Tripura.

True. But like @i_hate_circlejerk and many others have mentioned, there is an aversion to blue collar work in Kerala. It's not because of the unavailability of jobs. It's not the best feature to have, but this happens in most emancipated societies. This is more of an issue of how daily wage work is seen from a societal perspective.  > merits & sustainability of the Kerala model

Seems to more Kerala thrashing than anything else. Don't see too many merits mentioned :) Kerala has a lot of things going for it, and I'd rather be here than anywhere else in India. But it has its own challenges as well, just like any other state.

What Malayalis should do is to not gloat too much about how they are better that this or that state in India, but really look at where they are falling short.

The reality is that if the gulf money dries up, Kerala is fucked. Either produce capital and expertise in the state, or leave your beautiful homeland to work in possibly unfriendly places for those who have it.  Why so much unemployment in kerala?  [deleted] > Kerala started out with 47% literacy in 1951, at a time when UP had 12% and the India-wide average was 18.33%.

And that 47% started off from 0, thanks to Kerala's proclivity to open up and mix with other cultures. The various social reformation movements, and influx of Christian missionaries among many other factors contributed to this. Who claimed it was all post-independence Govts? The EMS Govt. though, made giant strides in post-independence Kerala through it's [education bill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Education_Act_1958_(Act_6_of_1959)) - it's not _all_ post independence, but a _lot_ _was_ post independence

>  Political Violence

Violence is never a good thing, but Political violence is slightly different. Political awareness among a population is generally considered to be a prime metric in considering the collective intelligence and societal emancipation of a region. In Kerala, political awareness is super high. This is often misused by parties, but political killings like what the BJP (RSS) have been spreading, are super low. The only political killings that do happen in Kerala are always RSS - CPI (M), in North Kerala. While these are highly condemnable, they are exceedingly rare.

And also, **crime metrics are reported and recorded much more stringently in Kerala, thanks to a well functioning executive**. You might remember a report about how Scandinavia had reported extreme high cases of sexual assault. Similar situation (though high influx of migrants is also a problem there).

> Hotbed for ISIS recruitement

This seems to be the most ridiculous of them all. Almost right out of the RSS playbook. Quoting the exact same article you've quoted: 

> India‚Äôs Muslim population, the third largest in the world, has so far contributed negligible numbers to Isis ‚Äì fewer than 90 people, according to most estimates. ‚ÄúMore have gone from Britain, even from the Maldives, than India,‚Äù 

Sure, Wahhabism is a growing threat in Kerala, and more and more muslims seem to be drawn to it. But the absolute numbers here are abysmally small and can't really be considered a metric at all.


> And finally, the extreme dependence on remittances

Remittances undeniably drive a bulk of Kerala's economy. You've provided good numbers, sure. What is your point though? Agriculture and brain drain might be flipsides to it, but comparing to other states that _do_ depend on Agriculture, isn't it better that people are employed abroad and are bringing money into the economy rather than flail about in abject poverty? It is funding a flourishing society, and Malayalis have built up vast business empires abroad. And are employing thousands of Indians.

According to this logic, all of the IT engineers flocking to Bangalore, are bad for the nation, because they should be doing Agriculture, and not depend on the US for offshore development projects.




***PS: Kerala has a bunch of issues. Treatment and safety of women, fewer opportunities for employment etc. are clear and present problems. But OP seems to be more interested in painting a comprehensively poor picture of the state, misrepresenting facts. Source - 22 years in Kerala.*** >wants to discuss merits

>Points out only demerits

Yeah, OP is clearly unbiased.
 Thanks OP. As a Keralite, I felt that the whole Kerala-is-best circlejerk on randia was getting out of hand. This was sorely needed.

 3;really? lot of repetitive points.. sanghis are putting in lot of effort in researching about Kerala these days.. such sincere hardwork should be appreciated.. but cherry picking facts to peddle some agenda is not right

you can't judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree

very high population density is not suitable for manufacturing & related jobs.

Huge pressure on land means less agricultural output & heavy dependence on imports

> extreme dependence on remittances

are you trying to spin this off as some sort of insult? it's not because it means human resource is the biggest asset of Kerala.

All these people went through the hurdles of getting a passport & visa in a country where millions can't even read or write. [removed] 1. We have always been more progressive than the rest of the country. That is not a negative mark.

2. We have the low-pay jobs the rest of India counts as employment. We just leave those to out-of-state workers. We do indeed have a problem with not having the a sufficient number of higher end jobs as compared to our output of graduates. This point of yours is partially legitimate.

3. Sweden is the rape capital of the world. /s

4. We do business by the book. There is less bribery and more regulation; that makes things harder.

5. Refer previous point.

6. Debt/GSDP being a bit higher is not bad. I don't know why anyone would think that.

7. This is really the only fully legitimate point in your post.

8. This is a just a laughable talking point right out of the sangh playbook. We are better educated so we get more job opportunities abroad. Deal with it.",2017-10-31 20:11:07
Business/Finance,TL;DR ‚Äì Godman to Tycoon ‚Äì The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev,544,6s4hoh,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6s4hoh/tldr_godman_to_tycoon_the_untold_story_of_baba/,95,"Context ‚Äì Yesterday in a thread I happened to mention reading this book and a few redditors had suggested doing a TL;DR of the book once I am finished. 

On the onset if you have the time and resources, I would highly recommend reading the book. It‚Äôs published by Juggernaut and is available for reading on their app at Rs. 80. I have read a few biographies and they can often go either way. This is one of few good biographies I have read, partly due to the Caravan Magazine style free flow writing rather than meandering on author‚Äôs perceptions and also because the subject (Baba Ramdev) is a fascinating and an intriguing person. It took me three days and essentially three sittings to complete it. The author ‚Äì Priyanka Pathak Narain is a journalist who used to cover the religion and spirituality section for Mint and that is where she begins on this journey. As part of the book she has interviewed over 52 subjects including Balakrishna ‚Äì Ramdev‚Äôs deputy and owner of 94% of shares of Patanjali Ayurveda Ltd. 

So here we go

* Baba Ramdev (Ram Kisan Yadav) was born in Said Alipur in a poor farming family. A sickly child he rather became very obese and was a victim to his father‚Äôs frequent violent outbursts. 

* Somewhere in his early 20s, he finds a band of Arya Samaj workers and is immediately drawn to them. He joined Khanpur gurukul where he learnt Sanskrit grammar, tended cows, collected alms and met his future deputy-to-be Acharya Balakrishna

* Balakrishna is quite into Ayurveda and is from Haridwar where he befriends **Acharya Karamveer** ‚Äì a stoic, soft spoken Arya Samaj member who had three post graduate degrees in Yoga, Indian Philosophy and Vedas. Karamveer soon takes Balakrishna under his wing and soon Ramdev joins them after a controversy.

* Ramdev learns yoga from Karamveer. To propagate Yoga to masses they soon take over ownership from **Shankar Dev**, a patron of Kripalu Bagh Ashram at Haridwar. Shankar Dev wants and only trusts Karamveer. But since he is Arya Samaj member he is not just ready to take Sanyas. Sensing an opportunity, Ramdev steps in. Taking Sanyas means two things -  1) He can‚Äôt keep any formal relations with his family 2) He cannot maintain any material wealth. I am bringing this up of course because this is very important

* Balakrishna meanwhile sets up Divya Pharmacy using the license of a silent partner, Swami Yogananda. Balakrishna himself from **Nepal** has legal cases against him (still in courst) for forging his high school and other documents to attain a passport.

* In early 2000s, Aastha and Sanskar become household name. The TV guys select Ramdev over Karamveer because - saffron robes means authenticity. **An interesting story here is that after Aastha turned Ramdev down, our diligent Baba went to Sanskar paying Rs 1 Lakh for a twenty minute slot.** This is also where I learnt that channels like Sanskar and Aastha don‚Äôt earn from advertising but godmen paying them for TV slots to demonstrate their abilities

* We all now know the story. Ramdev becomes a household name, not only to nauli kriya or churning of the stomach but also his personality, self-depreciating humor and showmanship 

* Soon Ramdev has friends at high places. **Mulayam Singh, ND Tiwari from Congress, Sudarshan Agarwal ‚Äì ex UP governor.** So when they are charged with Sales Tax fraud, Sudarshan Agarwal mounts immense pressure on Sales Tax Deputy Commissioner to drop the case and retire.

* Ramdev soon brings his extended family who takes over the business. His younger brother Ram Bharat is soon in charge of the finances. This causes rift between Karamveer and Ramdev. Afterall Ramdev shouldn‚Äôt have familial relations. So one day, Karamveer just walks out. 

* Swami Yogananda (whose license enabled the setting up of Divya Pharmacy) has a falling out with them. **Soon he is mysteriously knifed to death.** The neighbors are cagey and the case goes unsolved. 

* Enter Rajeev Dixit.  A swadeshi and founder of Azadi Bachao Andolan. Ramdev‚Äôs interest in entering politics leads to these two becoming incredibly close much to the discomfort of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat

* Meanwhile, his political favors with the Congress masters reap him reward as he wins contracts of Food Processing Plants. But soon, due to not paying workers at Divya Pharmacy minimum wage they draw the ire of CITU. Brinda Karat soon claims that the workers brought her ‚Äòtesticles of some sort of wildcat‚Äô. Apparently they told her deer horns and human skulls were crushed into the medicines. Though there is no proof to validate this, the samples tested by the Union Health Ministries‚Äô Ayurvedic unit ‚Äì AYUSH confirmed traces of human and animal DNA. Karat apparently met N.D Tiwari but according to her the minister didn‚Äôt budge to take any action

* Soon Ramdev starts to do roadshows across the country and abroad. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd is born over the controversial Divya Pharmacy. And here we see the next mystery. The disappearance of 77 year old TB infested Shankar Mahadev (Ramdev‚Äôs Guru). Mahadev was becoming quite vocal and anxious about the venture of Ramdev and his deputies. Police find nothing but a note in his room saying ‚ÄúI have taken some loan from you for this trust but I cannot pay it. Please forgive me. I am leaving‚Äù. Ramdev who was on a foreign trip didn‚Äôt cut it short as would have been expected. 

* Ramdev and Rajeev Dixit set up a new party ‚Äì **Bharat Swabhiman Andolan.** 

* The Takeover of Aastha ‚Äì When SEBI freezes 93% of Aastha‚Äôs owners share, sensing an opportunity Ramdev moves in and buys the remaining 7% for 10 crores in installment. The installments were never paid, but the ownership was transferred to Ramdev. Part of this was done in faith. Once the formalities are done, in a confrontational meeting, Ramdev bullies the owner and MD into resignation. Meanwhile, he asks another follower to buy Sanskar channel for him. Which that follower did.

* As mentioned earlier, keeping inline with Ramdev‚Äôs political ambitions, Rajeev Dixit and Ramdev became increasingly close much to dismay of Balakrishna and Ram Bharat. Soon, Rajeev Dixit was found dead in a locked bathroom. The hospital said it was cardiac arrest. Ramdev said on television that he had told Rajeev to take care of his health as he had diabetes, BP and heart disease. But Rajeev‚Äôs brother Pradeep says that he had no such health problems. Next, Ramdev convinces the family to conduct funeral in Haridwar as Dixit was son of the soil instead of his native Wardha. But as his body was laid for public demonstration, the Bharat Swabhiman Andolan workers were stunned. Dixit‚Äôs face was unrecognizable, strange purple and blue. His skin was peeling strangely. There was black, blue blood coming from his nose. Soon there was hue and cry. The Andolan workers wanted to conduct post mortem. Ramdev called a few of them for a personal meeting, confiscated their phones, checked their pens for cameras and told them that post mortem is against **Hindu Dharma.** When they refused to budge, Ramdev agreed but soon went back to the hall ahead of the workers and spoke on microphone ‚ÄòSome people have come from Mumbai. They want me to do a post mortem. Such cutting is against Hindu Dharma‚Äô. Soon Ramdev‚Äôs men got the body ready and set off to cremation ghats.

* Ramdev‚Äôs biggest fall came during his participation in the Anna movement. He wanted to use the movement for his political mileage. Hence while the original protesters were focused on a stronger Lokpal bill, Ramdev was more about bringing black money back. So he sat on a fast onto death protest. Meanwhile there was a backdoor meeting with senior Congress members (Pranab Mukerjee, P.K Bansal, Kapil Sibal and Subodh Kant Sahay). He then agreed to something and then went ahead and did the exact opposite. This ired the Congress as at midnight the cops swooped on the protestors with lathi charge. Ramdev of course famously tried to escape dressed in a **white salwar kameez**

* Part of the credit towards the success of Patanjali should go to their ex-CEO ‚Äì **S.K Patra**. He helped them lay the foundations, setup best practices for what was a highly disoriented company with no ethics or standard operating procedures. Patra also used his connections to stabilize against the witch-hunting on Ramdev‚Äôs business enterprises by the Congress Govt. But soon Patra‚Äôs influence once again made Balakrishna and Ram Bharat uneasy. Patra was let off after some ugly confrontation with Baba. 

* Today Patanjali is the second largest FMCG company with revenue of **Rs 10561 crores**. Its best selling products are ghee ‚Äì **Rs 1467 crore**, Dant Kanti toothpaste ‚Äì Rs 940 crore. But Patanjali ghee isn‚Äôt normal ghee but actually white butter which is not really good for health. Caravan has published a transcript from the book on this section - [Link](http://www.caravanmagazine.in/vantage/patanjalis-desi-cow-ghee-even-cow-ghee)

* Part of the reason for Patanjali‚Äôs market share is its price. Its below market as Baba believes only in taking a marginal share. But this is also possible because working at Patanjali is considered as **seva** and asking for increments and privileges are frowned upon. Economic Times has published a transcript from the book on this section ‚Äì [Link](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/fmcg/inside-patanjali-heres-what-life-is-like-in-baba-ramdevs-company/articleshow/59824892.cms) 

* There are a number of violations flagged by FSSAI (Food Safety and Standards Authority of India) including license number fraudulence on Patanjali noodles. A lot of third party agencies have written about the poor conditions and lack of hygiene in the production units.

Ramdev is a businessman, politician and godman rolled into one. He has no doubt helped popularize Yoga and Ayurveda in India. The people who speak to the author are no doubt captivated, influenced and no doubt bullied by him. His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon. His target is to get Patanjali to 20,000 crores by 2018-19. And under the environment of nationalistic and swadeshi assertions he very well might do it. 

Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR. But its quite hard summarizing a book without loosing on intricacies. Hence once again would recommend reading the book.

Edit 1: Formatting

Edit 2: Woah! Thanks for the Gold kind stranger. Though I would rather have people reading the book. While Indian non fiction writing and publishing are much to be desired, ventures like these must be encouraged. That will allow us to see similar good books that talk about interesting men, policies, events etc. ",rahultheinvader," Dude, thank you. This was really good. When you mentioned in that thread I knew I'd never read the book but I did want to know a gist.  [OP that delivers is the best kind of OP](http://i.imgur.com/Tyu0M4y.jpg).

PS, Author's take on this book:

> [I‚Äôd be Naive Not to Worry About a Fallout](https://www.thequint.com/books/2017/07/31/priyanka-pathak-narain-author-of-explosive-ramdev-biography)

Really good interview.  >Finally, I realise that the TL;DR post itself needs a TL;DR.

Ramdev is a shady dude Thanks. I had pre-ordered the book on Amazon the day it became available, but it hasn't yet reached me. I learned about the ebook on Juggernaut from your post and got a copy. I'm more than halfway through the book now, this guy is no swami, he's not even a hard nosed businessman, he's a mobster.

**Edit:** Finished the book a while back, thought I should update. Took less than three hours to read, was interesting enough to read in one sitting. Not badly written at all, saw the author went to Columbia to study journalism, it shows in the tight narrative and objective stance. It's clear that the author wanted to cover the less seen perspective, which makes this more of an investigative journalism piece than a biography. It's taken some effort to put this all together, but it's not a multi year ground breaking effort. Nevertheless very timely, and shows the murky underbelly. Lala Ramdev is incredibly ambitious, and since ambition is violence, he's quite ruthless and violent. It's a psych profile [probably true for many CEOs and top politicians who have all been found to have psychopathic tendencies.] (http://time.com/32647/which-professions-have-the-most-psychopaths-the-fewest/)

It's a rags to riches story of ruthless ambition. Also an example of what yoga without yama/niyama (dos and don'ts) can do, it can provide incredible energy for mischief. Even before reading this, I never trusted in Ramdev as a spiritual godman, but still didn't actively disapprove of him since I just considered him to be a businessman.
But reading your post has made me realize that he is a pretty terrible human being who feeds off the faith of the gullible.

Thanks for the post mate. You have completely changed my perception.

TL;DR. ""New shit has come to light."" I do not know the truth behind the facts presented in that book but based on what you have written it seems that this Baba knows how to gain people's trust and then punishes them for trusting him. In a way he is teaching them all a lesson for trusting him by exploiting their weaknesses.

For example, Shankar Dev and Karamveer seem to have had very high ideals and when they wanted to hand pick somebody to carry on their legacy out of all the people they chose Ramdev. It shows that these people were terrible at judging who is a real disciple and who is not. This is fucking scary man... Fuck! OP, this is great. I had always known there was something behind Rajeev Dixit's death. 

Just like he says to boycott Chinese goods, I think we should all boycott Patanjali goods.  Gangs of Wasseypur wali feeling aati hai story padh kar.

This is scary AF side of this FMCG empire.
 So as expected, this baba is nothing but a fraud who built his empire on top of lies, deceit and murders.

Thank you OP. Somebody need to make a hindi TLDR. thanks for the summary, was looking for a kindle version and couldn't find. great that you pointed to the app by Juggernaut. MF businessman. Now no buying of his products. Future Anurag Kashyap movie.  top class post.  one of the coolest reads Someone should make a series like narcos on him. I want baba ramdev mobile phone all made with haridwar hardware. Ecologically friendly and swadeshi. Any proofs in the book..? Great job OP and nice summary. You have already done good work but if you added the timeline it will be more helpful in keeping things into perspective. 

Though not surprising at all there are a few interesting tidbits here and there. As you said

>His close association with BJP government today means none of the open cases would move anytime soon.

This is such a shame. Wonderful write up. Thanks for your efforts  Great job OP. Thanks a lot for spreading the light. You're making randia great again. üòÇ OP is this book available in Hindi ? Good concise write up. Good job OP. Thank you. üëçüëå Movie banao koi iski life pe Bisi  Ramdev killed Dixit? Big fan of the baba now. Good read, thank you OP for your Quality contributions. As long as people believe these Godmans blindly they will milk them as much as possible.  Mine=blown gonna drop my career and become a baba now We know most of the baba ramdev products are shit. But why they are still popular ? They are very cheap for a normal lower middle class man. His advertisments reach common lower middle class man reliably well. Where as same cheap products are sold double the price abroad like in USA and uk. Soon his products will find high end price across the globe. Does it mean, anyone with specialized skill can grow to this level? Why anyone hasn't done? 

What do you think Ramdev baba will do with this amassed wealth? 

Karma always works, looks what is happening with Sonia and Rahul?

Are you guys feeling happy with existing FMCG products like Maggie, why not crib about it?

In India, there are enough people who are jealous about other's prosperity, indeed you can find them here too.

fellas take chill and learn from good things.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays¬†| March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as ‚Äúthe Hindu rate of growth.‚Äù Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2¬†The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4¬†Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. ‚ÄúCollective learning‚Äù is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals‚Äîall these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds‚Äîit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8¬†During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9¬†India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and ‚Äúmines of gold.‚Äù He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12¬†What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13¬†It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,‚Äù14¬†and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a ‚Äúper capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.‚Äù15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, ‚ÄúIn India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.‚Äù16¬†There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and ‚Äúdeindustrialized‚Äù India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule ‚Äúde-industrialised‚Äù India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant‚Äîby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a ‚Äúdrain of wealth‚Äù, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment‚Äîthe so called ‚Äúhome charges‚Äù‚Äîwas in fact quite small.20¬†If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.‚Äù¬†22¬†The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence‚Äîand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24¬†If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25¬†An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital‚Äîall of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26¬†But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not ‚Äúexploit‚Äù India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27¬†Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses‚Äîhence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace‚Äîthe Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution‚Äîan agricultural surplus‚Äîbut the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

‚Äú1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.‚Äù31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32¬†It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These ‚ÄúBangalores‚Äù have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù in world trade between 1950 and 1970; ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism‚Äîor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These ‚Äúmillion negotiations of democracy‚Äù slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its ‚Äúlow level equilibrium‚Äù of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35¬†David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the ‚Äúotherworldly values of the Hindus‚Äù or the ‚Äúimmobilizing effects of the caste system‚Äù and the ‚Äúconservative habits of the merchant caste‚Äù. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that ‚Äúpeople would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.‚Äù37¬†It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs‚Äîit has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (‚Äúremove English from primary schools‚Äù). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans‚Äô awareness of the Company‚Äôs conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and ‚Äúdespotic‚Äù empire . Following the Revolution, America‚Äôs connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing.",2017-09-12 01:15:04

Business/Finance,We really need to talk about Flairs.,110,6bacbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6bacbg/we_really_need_to_talk_about_flairs/,133,"Hello /r/india  
  
Here are some clarifications on submission flairs, since we see a lot of mis-flaired posts from time to time.  
  
**[P] - Political**  
  
These are for political posts only. If a post involved any politician, political party or anything primarily related to politics, then it must be flaired as political  
  
**[NP] - Non-political**  
  
These are for discussions where you are confident there is no politics involved. You cannot flair a post that is primarily or tangentially related to politics with an NP tag.  
 
This is important because quite a few people use the filters we have on the sidebar to filter out political (or non-political) posts, and misflairing one as the other may irritate these users.  
  
**[R] - Reddiquette**  
  
When this flair is selected, Reddit's Reddiquette guidelines are enforced in the thread, along with certain other restrictions so as to have a slightly higher quality discussion.    
  
Jokes, puns and low effort comments will be removed in such threads.
  
This can be used for both political and non-political topics.  
  
**[ASK] - AskIndia**  
  
These are flairs for self-posts where the OP wants to ask the community a question. You cannot use this flair for link posts (because that makes no sense unless ToI or HT wants to ask /r/india a question).  
  
If the question is political in nature, then the thread must be flaired with P or R, not with AskIndia. This is to prevent filters from being breached.  
  
**Science & Technology** 

This flair is for topics with an explicit, mostly non-political science & technology bent to it. If it tangentially involves politics, it is fine to use this flair in place of [P].   
 
If Modi makes a comment about the ISRO, then it is a P thread.  
If the ISRO conducts some research that points to where state governments can improve with irrigation, and a politician comments on that, then it can be flaired with Science & Technology assuming the primary focus of the story isn't the politician's comment.  

**Policy & Economy**
  
These flairs work similarly. The main topic of the subject matter should be about policy or economy. The instant the focus shifts to politics, political parties, politicians, etc. the flair must be [P].  

**Business & Finance**  

These flairs are for articles, or self-post submissions with a non-political, business bent to them. If you want to know where to invest or if Ola Cabs decides to go public, then this is the flair for you.  
  
**Entertainment** 

Entertainment flair is exclusively for pop-culture links, submissions, and discussions. Examples under this flair include movie trailers, movie clips, comics, YouTube joke sketches and things along those lines.  
  
This flair cannot be used for some politician saying something absurd, funny or ridiculous. That constitutes an editorialization of the title on the part of the OP - since the OP insinuates that the subject matter is funny with the title (instead of letting the reader make up their mind).   
 
**Sports and Food** 

Sports & Food flairs are very self-explanatory  

**AMA**
  
AMA flairs are given to OPs who verify their identity with the mod team. In case they choose not to verify, they will get an **Unverified** flair.  
  
**In-Depth**

This flair must be used carefully.This flair *only* used when you need an In-depth discussion about the topic. Top comments must have a proper explanation/discussion about the top. Top comments must fulfil the word limit else the comment **will** get deleted by all mighty automod.

---  
PS - In the event of confusion, just go for Reddiquette.
  
Recommendations for new flairs may be made below.  ",root_su," Can we have an Education/Career related flair?

Edit: And a Shitpost flair(for threads related to jokes, memes, roasts). How about a **META** flair to discuss about the policies and the discussions related to the subreddit? We need daily sax thread flair Help! My posts are not showing up on r/india/new after I post them.  I don't know if this has been discussed before but can we have a self help flair as well?  Does this mean the end of the Demonitization flair as it is not mentioned in OP? 

How about a ""News"" flair for topics a day or two old? And a ""Programming"" flair given the number of techies on randia and the lack of programming content?  Oh shit, late for the party...

I have been wanting to request this for sometime.

Can we have a Environment / nature flair (where in we can discuss things like the water shortage in the southern states, Air pollution in Delhi and surrounding areas, drought etc).  We understand but please make the flairing bot better and less annoying. Atleast give us the option to delete the comment after we have rightly flaired. What flair should be used for jokes and dank memes about political topics ? I think we need a Humour flair. [deleted] If the post is about corruption in Railways (not ministry), what flair should it have? We need a satire flair. The some of the fakingnews articles really are believable.  Can I express an obvious request? For posts which have been upvoted and have a discussion going - can the Mods simply rename the Flair instead of deleting the thread, in case they think the flair is inappropriate?  Jingoism flair ? What happened to the scheduled flair which we had for SC/ST users?  I recommend a flair for Defense and National Security - the few posts I shared on these topics were flaired Political.

Also, I have a question if Defence Research and Tech posts which can also involve weapons and platform tests, and discussion should be flaired SciTech or the ~~above post~~ above Defence flair ? Can we have a `Crime` flair? [deleted] We need DST. Long time pending! We need a shitpost flair guys You missed **In-Depth** the flair which makes auto-mod delete all the comments. Just so guys know, almost everything can be political.  can we have randia flair? [removed] But we can't end flair on app.
I wanted to post yesterday,but couldn't  What about posts about other countries' policies which affect India (eg the H1B thing, comments from Pak, etc)?
Should it be policy/economy? Or is there like a geopolitics flair? >Reddiquette

finally Can we have something called **Show-India** ?

Many people can show the new things they built !! There will invariably be topics that don't belong to any set flair, or belong to many.

Create a ""Miscellaneous"" flair, or maybe show some flexibility. We need analytics on which flair used most and least etc. Some insights please Just make these flairs OPTIONAL & don't autodelete posts when someone forgets to flair them. Let us have an **[OC]** flair to encourage the sharing of Original Content. Not sure if this has been asked before.. how do I add a flair via the Android app? Please enlighten. Add a flair for rape news. Please enable the rage faces, they were fun to use. [](/hehheh) Yes we really need to talk about life changing transcending flairs that changed the course of our lives... 

Jk dont ben me ;)  We need a `cow` flair.",2017-05-16 02:51:16
Business/Finance,"Debunked: ""Do the maths: India's first bullet train isn't 'free of cost' as Modi claims"" - lazy journalist",100,717dlb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/717dlb/debunked_do_the_maths_indias_first_bullet_train/,45,"The article in question: http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/do-the-math-india-s-first-bullet-train-isn-t-free-of-cost-as-modi-claims-117091800116_1.html

###Scumbag journalist: 

###Writes article saying ""Do the math"". Does no math.

**Faulty Basic Assumptions:**

A look at the JP¬• - IN‚Çπ exchange rate over [the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/NcmqjkW) is fluctuating around ‚Çπ0.6 for JP¬•1, for the most part. Here's a longer and more detailed view of the [last decade](https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM). While there are spikes and lows, the average seems to be sticking to around 0.6 Rupees per Yen. 

While Japan's Inflation Rate trend graph is certainly quite flat when averaged over the last decade or so, and the average remains near-zero, India's inflation rate has been trending downwards over the past decade, and has [accelerated downwards over the last 5 years](https://imgur.com/SoCXbPi).

The author seems to correlate the difference in inflation with the exchange rate, but the two are not actually linked directly. For instance, India's inflation rates for the years 2009 and 2010 were steep, at 14.97% and 9.47% respectively. During the same years, Japan's inflation rates were -1.67% and -0.40% respectively. The Yen actually *increased* in value, while the Rupee *dropped* in value, within their respective domestic markets. Yet the [exchange rate from January 2009 till January 2011 (the same 2 full years)](https://imgur.com/DHgubGX) remained relatively steady, somewhere between 0.485 - 0.550, on average, a range of about 0.065. One would expect to see a massive increase in the exchange rate, with one yen being able to buy *significantly more rupees*. But that was not the case. So the value of a currency on international markets has little to do with the domestically-perceived inflation in the country.

>Another factor to be considered is that while an interest rate of 0.1% may appear free from an Indian perspective, it is not so in Japan.

Has the author even considered that there are scenarios that are win-win? That economics is not a zero-sum game? This deal should be great for Japan. It can also be good for India. 

###So since the author was a lazy schmuck, here's the actual math:

We are currently getting Japan to invest USD 17 Billion in the project.

Since the author is concerned with exchange rates, that's JP¬• 1.89 trillion . Which is currently ‚Çπ 1.09 trillion. 

^(Note: While writing this, I used figures like JP¬• 1.892 tr and ‚Çπ 1.093 tr for my calculations, but rounded that last digit off while editing the text, in order to avoid visual confusion with the 4-digit years like 1967, 2067, etc. So the calculation is more precise than it looks.)

Over 50 years at 0.1% interest rates, the amount payable (at the end of 2067) would be JP¬• 1.99 trillion. If the current exchange rate were to remain constant, that would be ‚Çπ 1.15 trillion. But assuming the *peak* exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ‚Çπ 1.43 trillion. That's *STILL* an interest rate of less than 0.54%, assuming they had loaned us the entire amount in Rupees, instead of Yen.

So effectively, worst case scenario, **we got a loan of a trillion rupees, for 50 years, at a 0.5% interest rate.**

###Now here's where the author's argument (and lack of math) is turned on its' head:

Assuming 0% inflation in Japan, the value of that currency when repaid in Yen will be *equally* valuable in 50 years, as it would be if we paid all JP¬• 1.99 trillion upfront. So they aren't losing anything but time. That's great for them.

But seeing how India's inflation is assumed to be significantly above 0%, the value of the ‚Çπ 1.43 trillion repayment amount in 2067 will actually be *lower*, as perceived within India. Remember, domestic inflation doesn't translate directly into exchange rates. So even if the Yen-Rupee exchange rate becomes horribly high, the domestic inflation would actually *cushion* the sum we would have to pay. 

###Still don't get it? Okay try this: 

Here's a real-life example using real data from the past:

* I used [this link for the calculation of exchange rate](http://fxtop.com/en/currency-converter-past.php?A=1093&C1=JPY&C2=INR&DD=01&MM=01&YYYY=1967&B=1&P=&I=1&btnOK=Go%21)
* I used [this link to calculate inflation](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Let's forget the 'trillions' for simplicity.

Say your Grandpa took a loan of JP¬• 1,892.00, 50 years ago (1967), at 0.1% interest rate, the value of it in Rupees was ‚Çπ 39.42. Today you need to repay the loan as it has been 50 years. You need to pay back JP¬• 1,989.00. According the the present exchange-rate, that comes to ‚Çπ 1,156.00.

Now, back in Grandpa's day, ‚Çπ 1,156 was a lot of money. You could easily pay the rent for 2 months with just ‚Çπ 100. In 1967, ‚Çπ 100 was the average monthly salary in India. ‚Çπ 1,156 would have been nearly **a full year's salary**, back then. Today, ‚Çπ 1,156 is what you pay for 2 large pizzas. In 1967, a Coke was for ‚Çπ 0.05, meaning you could buy 23,120 bottles of Coke with ‚Çπ 1,156. Today, you can buy only 115 bottles of Coke with that amount (the original small glass bottles at that). India experienced a cumulative inflation of ~4000% over the last 50 years. Paying back ‚Çπ 1,156 today, feels the equivalent of [paying back ‚Çπ 30.25 back in 1967](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=30.25&C1=INR&INDICE=INCPI1958&DD1=18&MM1=09&YYYY1=1967&DD2=19&MM2=09&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value).

Meanwhile in Japan, the value of JP¬• 1,989.00 today has only dropped to a third of its' 1967 value ([worth about JP¬• 620.00 of the time](http://fxtop.com/en/inflation-calculator.php?A=613.9&C1=JPY&INDICE=JPCPI2010&DD1=01&MM1=02&YYYY1=1970&DD2=01&MM2=02&YYYY2=2017&btnOK=Compute+actual+value)). Japan experienced relatively tiny cumulative inflation of 224% over 50 years.

So your Grandpa paid off a month's rent in 1967, and only had to buy the Japanese lender 2 pizzas 50 years later? And the Japanese lender actually lost money in the process? Huh. Guess that's why interest rates are higher in currencies that have higher inflation rates.

Now obviously, if the author is right, and Japan's inflation remains a flat 0% for the next 50 years, then Japan certainly won't lose any money on this deal. Which is excellent for them! However, it still means that India, with a non-negative inflation rate, will actually be coming out on top, as long as the currency exchange doesn't go absolutely berserk. 

###Assuming a 3% inflation rate, when we pay back ‚Çπ 1.43 Trillion in 2067, it will be as if we were paying back only ‚Çπ 0.326 Trillion (in today's terms). 

^(*assuming the peak conversion rate of the past 10 years: JP¬• - IN‚Çπ 0.71872, which is a worst-case scenario*)

This is because ‚Çπ 1.4 trillion will have far less perceived value (domestically) in 2067, than it does in 2017. 

Put another way, if we take ‚Çπ 326 Billion today, and invest it in a *reaaaalllyyy* shitty-ass mutual fund that only yields 3% interest (that's impossibly pathetic, seriously), then in 50 years, it will easily pay off our 'loan' of ‚Çπ 1.43 Trillion. 

If you're using a Fixed Deposit scheme that gives 7% interest per annum, **you will only need to invest ‚Çπ 49 Billion.** [Try it for yourself here](http://www.thecalculatorsite.com/finance/calculators/compoundinterestcalculator.php)

So... take this loan of ‚Çπ 1.09 trillion, and put ‚Çπ 49 Billion aside in the 7% fixed deposit account, and use the balance ‚Çπ 1.04 trillion as you see fit... hire strippers, or invest in solar power plants, or build a railway with it. What do you call 1.04 trillion bucks that you can do with as you see fit without needing to pay it back? You call it free money. Obviously, the more wisely you invest it, the better the outcomes will be. But yes, it's effectively free. 

Now, mind you, we aren't getting it as cash, but we *are* getting it as a solid investment that will generate revenue (and pay off its' own dues) and will have further positive externalities (employment, new skills and training, tech-transfer, economic growth of connected areas, increased urbanization, reduced environmental impact, reduced accidents, lower congestion, etc). It will also leave a lot of the money in government coffers available for more investment into other projects over the next few decades, many of which should see some decent returns on investment over the next 5 decades.

Yes, Japan comes out a winner in the deal, ***and so does India!*** The higher our domestic inflation, the cheaper our repayment will seem. Just like Grandpa's ‚Çπ 1156 seems like such a paltry amount, when seen from 50 years later. Obviously we don't want the inflation to be too high, but having a sub-4% inflation rate will keep our economy healthy, while reducing the burden on future taxpayers in paying off this big 'loan'.

This, btw, is the reason you should invest your money and ensure that it gives returns of **at least** 5-7% per annum, in order to beat inflation. Because otherwise, sitting in a bank account, your money is actually **losing** value over time.

>The 508km-long Mumbai to Ahmedabad High Speed Rail (MAHSR) is scheduled for completion in December 2023, but commencement date has been sought to be advanced to August 2022.

>Initially, each high speed train will have 10 cars and the capacity to accommodate 750 people, The Times of India said. It will increase to 16 cars that will accommodate 1,200 people.

>According to initial estimates, around 1.6 crore people are expected to travel by the bullet train annually. By 2050, around 1.6 lakh commuters should travel by the high-speed train on a daily basis.

> The fares could be in the range of Rs 3000 - Rs 5,000.

^(Source - http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mostly-elevated-partly-under-sea-all-you-need-to-know-about-mumbai-ahmedabad-bullet-train/story-nzG4ROjD9IRE00FcK4fD7N.html)

They want to complete it in 5-6 years, but let's be conservative and just give it 10 years. Let's assume that the next 10 years has all the construction and the low-volume trains running and then just directly jump to the 1200 capacity trains by 2027, for ease of math. That leaves us 40 years to repay ‚Çπ 1.43 trillion, using only train revenues.

The article claims that 1.6 crore people may travel annually initially (that's 44,000 people per day), but that it'll increase to 1,60,000 people per day by 2050. Basically, they intend to increase capacity to 360% over 40 years. Since capacity isn't something that can increase exponentially, we'll assume a linear growth in capacity, from 44k to 160k. The train completes a single trip in 2.5 hours. Assume 30 minute boarding/de-boarding time on either end, a single train will conservatively make 1 full trip in 3.5 hours. That means that a single train can comfortably make 4 trips in a day (14 hours active duty) leaving 10 hours for maintenance and all that jazz. Meaning one train has the capacity to ferry 4800 people per day.


    160000-44000 = 116000 people: increased capacity over 40 years
    116000/4800 = 24 trains: added capacity over 40 years
    (40*12)/24 = 20 months: the time it takes to add one more train to the system.

Basically: One new 1200-seater train is added every 20 months, for 40 years, after a starter-pack of 9 trains (for the initial load of 44k people per day).

So averaged over 40 years, there are around 12+9 trains operating. That gives us 21 trains, making 4 trips a day. (Side note: 21*4: That's 84 trips per day, both ways, meaning that assuming 14 working-hours on a platform, there are 3 trains departing every hour in one direction - one every 20 minutes - convenient). Each trip has a capacity of 1200 people, 365 days a year, for 40 years. 

    21*4*1200*365*40 = 1471680000 passengers total.

1,471,680,000 passengers total: that's **1.47 Billion passengers**. And how much is being charged per seat per trip? ‚Çπ 3000? 

###That gives us a total revenue collection of ‚Çπ 4.415 Trillion. 

Let's assume that the train only runs at 70% seating capacity, on average. They would still collect ‚Çπ 3.09 Trillion. 

[Operational costs will be around ‚Çπ 412 cr (‚Çπ 4.12 billion) per year](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/Yearly-bullet-train-operations-to-cost-Rs-412cr-Report/articleshow/39191311.cms) which comes to a total of ‚Çπ 164.8 billion over 40 years. 

That leaves us with ‚Çπ 2.93 Trillion in revenue, with which we need to repay a total loan value of ‚Çπ 1.43 Trillion. 

**That leaves a cool ‚Çπ 1.496 trillion as pure profit, after paying back every penny of the loan.**

###Wait, what?! 

*You're telling me, we can basically drop the ticket prices to ‚Çπ 1500 per seat (an act that will almost surely yield packed trains every day) and* **still** *pay off the loan?!* 

I dunno! Let's check: 

* 1.471 billion trips * ‚Çπ 1500 = ‚Çπ 2.2075 Trillion. 
* *STILL* assume just 75% occupancy: ‚Çπ 1.656 Trillion.
* Deducting the operational costs leaves: ‚Çπ 1.491 Trillion. 

Hot *damn*, we can pay for the train using just ticket collection, even if we price the tickets at ‚Çπ 1500, and using the most conservative estimates possible. With ‚Çπ 1.656 Trillion revenue, we easily could allow for an increase in ""operational costs"" to ‚Çπ 5.675 billion per year (a whopping **38% increase** in operational costs, compared to the ‚Çπ 4.12 billion figure) and still be able to pay everything off just fine... in just 40 years.

Who in their right minds thinks this is a bad idea? Hell, Ahmadabad-Mumbai Sleeper buses take 8 hours, and charge between ‚Çπ 700-1400. The Shinkansen will be absolutely *flooded* if they drop prices.

###DO THE MATH",fsm_vs_cthulhu," I remember reading this article yesterday, laughing my ass off at the juvenile level of inflation based foreign exchange movement explanation. That was as advanced an explanation of economics as saying the atom is an lowest indivisible particle of nature is to physics. Having the audacity to propose policy with such childish level of economics knowledge was as laughable as brave.  It's M K Venu from wire.  > Here's a longer and more detailed view of the last decade

Clever - showing 2009 to 2017 as last decade - because the 2 remaining years of the last 10 years change the graph considerably.

Your last ""decade"" graph - https://imgur.com/tOxvgAM

> But assuming the peak exchange-rate in the last 10 years (ie: 0.71872 - July 2012), India would be repaying about ‚Çπ 1.43 trillion. 

How is the peak rate of the last 10 years relevant. 

For e.g. take the rupee dollar rate - how is the rupee dollar rate 10 years back relevant to today's rate? Or to the rate 10 years hence? I will still support this.

How is this even on the table?

BloombergQuint explains it well here:

https://www.bloombergquint.com/business/2017/11/28/should-depositors-fear-the-new-financial-resolution-deposit-insurance-bill

ELI5 version: Say you are a bank and you have given out money to several entities. Say those entities are not able to return the money, so they become NPAs. What can a bank do in this situation?

* Do a bail out. 
* Do a bail in. 
* Go bankrupt and close down. 

The point of note here: These are the last steps that a bank  takes, there are several ways that the bank tries to recover money at first - selling the assets of the entity, selling the entity itself, issuing bonds to raise more money and avoiding bankruptcy, not issuing profits as dividends and absorbing them to solve NPAs, downsizing and firing staff etc. Infact, in the new bankruptcy laws which is already in place, the banks have the power to take over the entity and try to turn it around so that it becomes capable to pay off it's debts. Incase that's not possible, it can sell the entity itself and keep all the proceeds to itself, which is what's happening for some of the steel companies in India which form the largest NPAs. The promoters and owners of the said entity don't get any profits from the sale. 

With great bankruptcy laws, banks in developed nations are able to recover upto 60 % of NPAs. However, rates in India are low, only 20% of NPAs get recovered. 

Now imagine a hypothetical scenario where the bank has no other option but to use the last three options I discussed above. So what should it do?

With a bail out - the tax payers of the country give money to recover the bank. 

With a bail in - the depositors and customers absorb some losses and give money to recover the bank. 

Note: Whether a bail out or a bail in, it's the people who are going to pay for the recovery of the banks. Also note, every person who participates in an economy is a tax payer - whether of direct tax or indirect tax. 

Now comes the interesting part: RBI has insured all deposits in the banks to a sum of 1 lakhs. So if a bank goes bankrupt, you are insured a sum of upto 1 lakh and you can claim that amount from RBI. 

So what has changed in this law? Two things:

* The law has given the power to RBI to change the insured amount. This is necessary because when this 1 lakh insurance limit was set, it was in 1970s and it used to be a big amount then. 
* **Insured deposits do not come under bail in. ** Which is why the title that banks can wipe out your money is incorrect. 

What changes for you because of this law:

* Previously, without bail in option, if the bank was not bailed out, you could have claimed a maximum of 1 lakh from RBI as insured money. With bail in option, that remains the same, your insured amount of 1 lakhs is what you can claim if the bank goes bankrupt. 

* In extreme screnio, banks can take your deposits and bail in with that to save itself. However, if that point arrives, a bank going bankrupt is more disastrous than a bail in. 

Either way, people pay if bank get unrecoverable NPAs, either through taxes, or through deposits. Which is a better option is a point of debate. What's not a point of debate is that we need to strengthen our financial institutions, keep them away from political influence - one way is privitizing them, and get more robust bankruptcy laws application.  Because it is pointless fear mongering.

We had this discussion a few days ago. What do you think happens today if a Bank fails and the government does not choose to bail it out?

You lose all your money above 1 lakh and go sue the Bank.

The Bail In clause actually benefits you because you're going to be placed above bond interests because those Bonds will be used to recapitalize too, before coming after your deposits.

The matter of contention is that now the entity comes under scrutiny before actual failure, and that is a *good* thing. My bone with it is why do we need a separate corporation instead of empowering the RBI, but that's a different matter.

Seriously, what do you think the laws are today?

 So, if a bank has rising NPAs people will move accounts to a safer bank. Then the bank collapses on itself, from reducing accounts and rising NPAs? Because baa baa black sheep,have you any fools?


Yes sir,yes sir,one country full. This is extremely scary. Banks give huge loans to the wealthy and influential. They default and to cover the bank's losses, the depositers also take a 'hair cut'. For the money they forego, they are given equity in the bank which in most cases, will not be anywhere close to the extent of deposit used in 'bail in'. Same thing happened in Cyprus Bhaiyya bail out aur bail in nahi, gau out or gau in. Hamar dau dau bachiya hai. Kuch saal baad gau ban jaayi. Because There is no provision of cancellation of Deposits. 'Bail In' exempts Deposits and other liabilities while there is also provision of Insurance on every deposit account so your money remain safe. Bail In is the last resort to get you the money Depositors and Creditors apart from ‚Çπ100000 insurance money. As usual media is peddling fake news. Modi will leave us only after sucking us off every penny we have , kuch chutiya admi hain bhai  Earlier the insurance was 1 lakh, today its 0...  not all that different in the larger scale I feel",2017-12-05 18:08:06
Business/Finance,No Progress on the Panama Papers! Despite over 1800 Indian Names Disclosed!,256,63lhl9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/63lhl9/no_progress_on_the_panama_papers_despite_over/,77,"NO PROGRESS ON THE PANAMA PAPERS. OVER 1800 INDIAN NAMES HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED.

""The Panama Papers illuminate a key aspect of why the system isn‚Äôt working‚Äìbecause globalization has allowed the capital and assets of the 1 % (be they individuals or corporations) to travel freely, while those of the 99 % cannot.

Globalization is supposed to be about the free movement of people, goods, and capital. But in fact, the system is set up to enable that mobility mainly for the rich (or for large corporations).

The result is global tax evasion, the offshoring of labor, and an elite that flies 35,000 feet over the problems of nation states and the tax payers within them.""


PANAMA: No questions asked!

The ways of India‚Äôs rich and famous are increasingly becoming public knowledge. The disclosure that as many as five hundred prominent Indian‚Äôs, including Incredible India‚Äôs latest brand ambassador - Amitabh Bachchan, owned offshore companies in Panama is just the latest of the unraveling. All one can say is that he is in the good company of the likes of Vladimir Putin, David Cameron and Nawaz Sharif among others.

Panama is a small sliver of a country in Central America joining North and South America. Its immediate geographical neighbors are Costa Rica in the north and Colombia in the south. It is the narrow isthmus that separates the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. A 77 kilometers long manmade canal capable of accommodating large ships joins the two oceans. The revenues from this were for long the nations biggest source of income since the canal opened in 1914.

Panama soon found that becoming a tax haven that assured investors of their privacy provided a more lucrative income. The proximity to the Americas, and the balmy Caribbean islands, and countries like Colombia with its huge cocaine production and export business, and Latin America‚Äôs many kleptomaniac tin pot dictators made Panama even more attractive. Till not long ago the Canal Zone was under the protection of US troops and that too served as an incentive for Americans seeking an offshore tax haven.

Panama is a tax haven, which means it is a country that offers foreign individuals and businesses little or no tax liability in a fairly politically and economically stable environment. Tax havens also provide little or no financial information to foreign tax authorities. This in short is the reason Panama is so important to our moneyed people who have good reason to hide their real wealth.

Why do the rich then want to hide their wealth? This is simply because officially they are not as wealthy as they really are. And if they honestly declared their true wealth they would not only be liable to pay more income tax but could also open many of them to various charges of corporate fraud and malfeasances that could earn them hefty prison terms.
To comprehend this one must understand how most of our ‚Äúcaptains of industry‚Äù many of whom sit on the Prime Ministers Council of Trade and Industry became rich and powerful?

When an ‚Äúindustrialist‚Äù launches a new project, the project costs are usually hugely overstated. The suppliers of plant and machinery then pay the promoter kickbacks, which become the promoter capital. Thus, the more the number of projects an individual promotes the wealthier he or she becomes. But it is not income you can declare. So it gets hidden in a tax haven. This is how the big bucks are made and salted away.

A good part of this money is round tripped back to India via nearby tax havens like Mauritius or Singapore. Not surprisingly in 2015 the top FDI investing countries were Mauritius (27%) and Singapore (21%). Both are now the home of hundreds of corporate entities that act as a pass through for funds being held overseas for Indians or Indian entities. These countries are little more than cutouts for monies held in other more distant tax havens like Panama, Cayman Islands, Bermuda and Lichtenstein. The smaller the country the more pliable the officials.

The fourteen PSU banks control almost 80% of the commercial credit advanced in India. In addition the government also owns the two big project finance institutions, IDBI and IFCI, and large institutional investors like LIC and general insurance companies like Oriental and GIC. The state ownership of these, with powers vested with the powers that be in New Delhi, political and bureaucratic, ensures that the projects are suitably ‚Äúgold plated‚Äù without any rigorous scrutiny. And why scrutinize when projects seldom fold up and in a system where restructuring means lending more money to evergreen the loans?

The list of NPA‚Äôs includes almost the entire roster of top Indian companies. As of June 2016, the total amount of Gross Non-Performing Assets (NPAs) for public and private sector banks is around Rs. 6 lakh crore. The NPA figures along with total debt for each of the 49 public and private sector banks were shared by the Ministry of Finance in response to a Parliament question. According to RBI estimates, the top 30 loan defaulters currently account for one-third of the total gross NPA‚Äôs of PSU banks. Till March 31, 2015, the country‚Äôs top five PSU banks had outstandings of Rs 4.87 lakh crore to just 44 borrowers, if borrowers were to be categorized in terms of those having outstandings of over Rs 5,000 crore. These businesses include Essar, Reliance ADAG, Jaiprakash Associates, Adani's, GVK, GMR and Lanco. Some of them like Essar have defaulted in the before. This stress problem is fairly endemic.

Of the big companies or groups only Tata‚Äôs, Reliance Industries and AV Birla can be considered free of financial stress. Most if not all the money earned by gold plating plant and machinery, under invoicing of exports and over invoicing of imports is retained abroad. Has anyone wondered why the UAE is the second largest destination of India‚Äôs merchandise exports ($33 billion in 2015) and third largest source of merchandise imports ($26.2 billion in 2015)?

The UAE is also the largest source of legal and illicitly imported gold. Last year India officially imported over 900 tons of gold worth $35 billion. The mysteriously owned corporations incorporated in tax havens like Panama mostly finance these exports. And a good part of the illicitly exported gold also.

According to Global Financial Integrity, a Washington DC based think-tank; Indians were estimated to have illicitly sent out $83 billion in 2015. Where does this money go? Countries like Switzerland that offer banking secrecy usually do not pay any interest on such deposits. So money goes to corporations in tax havens from where they are invested in businesses world over. Have you ever wondered how many of our top businessmen have managed to become so big overseas so soon?
This is where the Panama‚Äôs of the world come in. 

There was a time when Panama in India was synonymous with a cheap brand of cigarettes manufactured by the Dalmia Golden Tobacco Company. In the West, Panama was a man's wide-brimmed straw hat made from the leaves of the Toquilla tropical palm tree. That Panama too is now forgotten. Now Panama is synonymous with offshore corporations and assured secrecy. The times have changed.

Tax avoidance and Tax evasion are completely different thing. One is legal and another is illegal. Add to that the names are big so PR management companies can easily shut up any news outlet by threatening to remove the ads(by celebrity and company, nobody wants bad press). I also blame Indian Express, the reporting is shoddy and there is very narrow reach. Add to that the Newspaper is in English, the number of readers are way less than any other newspaper‚Äã.

Even Pakistan had more protest than here when Nawaz Sharif was named in Panama papers. Tells you how shitty the situation is if we have to look up to pak. Personally, I stopped giving a fuck about it long time back. This is because, I feel tax evasion is not that serious of a crime. I mean, yes they broke the law and everything but if you think about it, it doesn't compares with the likes of coalgate, fodder scam etc. They did not steal public money or anything. Chances are, many of us would have done the same thing like them to save taxes like they did. Hell, many of even do it now, on a smaller scale, by buying something something, and showing something else, so that we could a save a few buck in tax.
  
TL:DR; They didn't steal my money, so who cares. I don't. Source of this information? Work and jumla are different things. Govts after govts have lacked motivation on acting against corruption.  Modi ji ended all the corruption in the country. What papers are you talking about? Simply disclosure of names in the Panama leaks is neither an admission of nor a complicity in breaking the law.

Framing charges isn't the default first step in the judicial process. It is preceded by investigation, surveillance and intelligence. So calm your misplaced justice boner.

Business/Finance,What are my options?,38,7a8no5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7a8no5/what_are_my_options/,25,"So I read a post about a teen about his options if he went ahead to skip college and I wanted to know what options I got.

I am 23, undergrad in BBA in Finance and working in a family business for almost a year. I do not know if I am meant for the business and how the future for the business holds. 

But lets say, if I were to join the work force at the age of 30, what skills can I self-teach to make myself employable in the next 7-8 years? I mostly do door-to-door sales for my business, but not sure if I enjoy that. Programming, graphic design, AI, etc. what would you suggest? I am average at maths. 

I am not planning to get a masters degree. Will that hurt me in the future?

Also, on a side note, how can I become street smart? 

Thank you.",nosleepnomore," Honestly the job market wouldn't see you as a good candidate if you self educated yourself in something but have experience in something else. At least the big companies won't entertain your programming self studies or MOOCs if your past work experience of 8 years is not relevant. 

You could try putting every project, every course on github, making your skills as knowable as possible on blogs and/or YouTube. This would be my suggestion. Enter hackathons for programming, kaggle for AI, get your graphic designs up on display something like that. Anything noticeable. Programming like Java shouldn't be super tough to pick up initially. But of course the nuances are hard.

The thing is, the big companies trust other big companies to mould you similarly to how they want you. So if you're already moulded by another big company you're ready to start in theirs. If not... they don't really trust you and can't judge you well enough in interviews. It's risky for them.

People are opening up to MOOC degree based recruitment but it's not going to be easy OP. But good luck :) Didn't mean to put your spirits down but be prepared to work really hard at 30 to get a job. Does the family business make money or lose money? In what business are you involved ?

**Previous Threads:** [*State of the Week* wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/wiki/state_of_the_week)",anon_geek," One of the Best places from India. For a goan in Chennai it was as close as it get to being like Home. I visited Pondi last year. It's such a peaceful place. Everyone seems laid back.   

Chilling with people on the promenade along Rock Beach at 3 AM while both drunk and slightly stoned is one of the best experiences I've had.  Come visit us! Pondicherry is lovely this time of the Year!  Well planned roads, cheap booze, plenty of beaches, very close to Chennai, French grils ‚ù§Ô∏è Moved out of Pondicherry a couple of years ago and this posts makes me miss home. Very peaceful to come visit. Especially right now. Go to the different beaches. Enjoy the architecture. Go to Auroville and smoke a blunt. Go to the Ashram and Matrimandir and get some peace. Take a bike and roam in the ""white town"" at 6 in the morning. And also, don't forget your alcohol.
Try out different restaurants in the evening and Nehru St and Mission St for all your shopping. If you are there on Sunday, do go to the Sunday Market on MG road. 

If you are driving, do fill up your tanks and also more in a storage. Cheapest rates IMO.

EDIT


Fun fact: When I mention white town, it is called the boulevard. The heart of Pondicherry. Was built by the French(duh). They have an amazing drainage system with two canals one going north-south and other east to west. The north South Canal also separates the white town from the regular town(The french were racists). The french lived in the white town next to the beach and the rest on the west. The french also constructed roads and all the east to west roads are parallel to each other and end at the beach. 
The regular town was also divided by the french based on religion. The north was full of Hindus and that is where you will find the old temples. The south was Christians. You will find beautiful churches and missionary schools. The South east was Muslims. Their roads are the unique roads in pondicherry where they don't end up in the beach but are diagonal and face the Mecca. There is a Pondicherry Arch at all the three borders when you enter Pondicherry. And also, two clock towers at the focii of the boulevard. Oh forgot to mention it is in the form of an [ellipse](https://www.google.co.in/maps/place/Puducherry/@11.9322492,79.8217652,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3a5361ab8e49cfcf:0xcc6bd326d2f0b04e!8m2!3d11.9138598!4d79.8144722). A lot of people in Chennai use Puducherry as a weekend getaway to binge but Puducherry has so much more to offer. There is some charm in taking a walk on those cobbled streets, going to Auroville  or Matrimandir.I have spent a lot of Sundays on those beaches reading a book. I used to finish entire novels there. In the evening, go to one of those restaurants and eat a sumptuous meal with a beer. Le Club was absolutely amazing. An evening walk on the beach with a  bit of sweat dripping from your head which the wind tries to soothe.

Thank you for the memories Puducherry and thank you for providing a much needed quick escape from the chaos of corporate life. Also, you get to see French chicks in salwars. I don't know the intricacies, but the desi cloth definitely makes them 10/10s.  How's Kiran Bedi's performance till date? Also, these places come under Puducherry UT:

[Oriental Bird Images](http://orientalbirdimages.org/search.php?Bird_ID=425) The map of Pudducherry is weird .. a mad collection of exclaves ! How much French cultural influence is there in the local population. Is there anyone at all who speaks primarily in French?  Go to airbnb and book Thomas Kutty's (i think that was the name, or maybe I just made up a mallu sounding name trying to remember it..) homestay. Loved that place,hope it's still there. It's a small fisherman's house ON the beach converted into a homestay, with an open terrace that also has a kitchen. Visit the white town, go to the ashram if you're inclined to it, have some good dinner and cocktails at quaint hipsterish pubs and cafes, go to the proper town, buy cheap and great quality booze, carry other requisites (blunts, mosquito coil, camera to capture moon and sun rise and the occasional surfers and beach stunt boys in the morning). Eat some fresh fish. Live life. Do all this in any particular order. But most importantly,

DEFINITELY DRINK WAREHOUSE TEQUILA.  It's a local tequila you get there that is brutal.

Pondy has got something for all, cool scenes, ashrams and temples, commune living, cheap liquor, friendly people, great beaches, good shopping, great food, colonial and cultural places. And it's easy to access. Visited Puducherry in last Onam holidays. Hip place. 10/10.  Great place. Great beaches. Great booze. Well planned city. 

Also, if anyone visits, there is a place where the fishermen take you to the middle of the ocean and drop you in for and hour or so. Definitely try that. 

I heard there is scuba diving and such but haven't tried.  Baker Street and Cafe Xtasi FTW ! I really wish the architects and planners of the city had used some of the block planning from the French part of the city throughout the rest of the town as well. It's a great place but can be so much better. One more tidbit: 

Pondicherry has 9 medical colleges, 7 in Puducherry itself, probably the densest collection of medical colleges in all of India. 

:: Thanks, /user/Aaron_Ramasamy Also, [Chandernagore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandannagar), now a municipal corporation in West Bengal, near Kolkata was a territory (enclave) of Pondicherry UT which had to be given up &  merged into W.Bengal due to distance and impracticality of administration.  Visited Pondicherry long time back and it was like this chilled out place somewhere  Ok couple of questions:

1. What is the best time to visit w/o burning your skin?
2. For someone vegetarian, non-smoker,teetotaller, what to do here? Le caf√© , so many memories!  I live 10km from Pondicherry across the border in TN and thanks for the cheap petrol and drinks over the years. Visited Pondi few years back. Had an amazing time. Paradise beach, main beach, Aurbindo ashrams, beer brewery (from gate), Matrimandir all were fantastic. Couldn't get into beer brewery as we didn't know we could schedule our visit a day before.  
Loved it. :) Thanks for the memories.   
Po Pondy!!  [deleted] One of the cleanest place you could witness within tamilnadu will be obviously puducherry.... What language do the commoners speak? If a Northie Hindi/English speaker was to join JIPMER would he face any problem? On the border touching Pondy and Cuddalore, there is a bar called ""Kennedy"". The ambience was one of kind because most of the tables are in a coconut grove with the tables around the trees. And oh, they server Rat meat there or so the menu said. 

Anyway, great place. I was lucky as a friend of mine lived there.  Been here twice! I think this was the last vacation I've had! It's beautiful. The streets have such a comfy feel to it, man. Especially in the afternoon under the shades of the trees by the streets! The whole place has got a comfy vibe to it. I love it! :D What is the cheapest way to get to Puducherry from Bangalore using public transport (trains are already completely booked)? Am i the only one who thinks Puducheri should be a part of T.N already? its INSIDE T.N for crying out loud, its funny how we can easily divide states on an arbitrary basis(chhattisgarh,Telengana,uttarakhand,jharkhand) but can't actually unite any states. So I have heard of discriminating attitude there by other redditors, is this true? Wow - So Kiran Bedi was appointed Governor after she lost the Delhi election?  Holy crap!

The primary reason for my skepticism being the *little to no understanding of the crypto world that Indian government possesses.* It's noteworthy and depressing at the same time that Finance Minister of India [compared cryptocurrencies to ponzi schemes late last year.](https://qz.com/1171183/bitcoin-is-neither-legal-nor-illegal-in-india-and-everyones-confused/)

Not many users out here know that [Indian crypto markets crashed flat 25-30%](http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/with-rbi-s-near-ban-announcement-cryptocurrency-prices-crash-sharply-118040501410_1.html) in less than an hour of RBI notification on **April 5, 2018** because of panic selling by investors whereas the foreign exchanges didn't show any substantial fluctuations because of the same.

This decline in value is sure to repeat at the end of the 3 months window (keeping in mind the **assumption** that RBI's decision holds at the end of these 3 months) with a greater percentage fall this time because investors will not be able to convert their fiat to crypto anymore in India for the immediate future. Personally, I won't be much surprised if XRP value comes down to 0.05$-0.10$ at that time. Without any exception, same shall be the fate of other VCs too.

So, the opportunity lies for those who have accounts with foreign banks since they shall be able to procure cryptocurrencies at dirt cheap prices here in India and be able to sell them abroad at the normal prices prevailing in world markets. This shall be beneficial for both categories of people, those looking to profit out of arbitrage and those intending to HODL them. I admit this post benefits only some investors based on their geographical presence and not the cryptoverse at large but one should make the most of what she/he has. *When life throws rocks at you, build a fort out of them.* ;)

Isn't this kind of Money Laundering? Governments are very strict about this. Even I read some US guy tried to do this in Korea and he got some notices, even there is a chance of deportation. Be very careful.",2018-04-11 00:42:25
Business/Finance,Indian banking system under attack!,172,589exo,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/589exo/indian_banking_system_under_attack/,84,"I have a strong reason to believe that Indian banking is under systematic attack. The shit hole goes very deep and the problem is compounded by the fact that the media ""tones"" down its coverage (obviously to avoid panic). There are malware attacks (on ICICI which is siphoning of email contacts and sending its account holders phishing emails), Advanced persistent threats on Axis Bank (they disclosed this to RBI), ATM frauds as in State Bank of India and multiple accounts of phishing attacks on individuals. Union Bank has also suffered cyber heist. 

A worrying trend is by use of SIM Swap. Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp), your details through identity thefts and blocking your actual SIM's so that you cannot receive the SMS alerts. 

Two factor authentication is very basic (dependent on passwords alone) which again can be easily retrieved because most users re-use their passwords. 

Its getting scarier and worsened. 


A simple remedy as of now is to change PIN of your existing debit card and get ""CHIP and PIN"" card which secures transaction because they cannot be replicated easily. Of course, moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised. 

Edit 1: In response to ""proofs"" and so called ""click bait""; here are the links. Please connect the dots. 
Further, BBM and Threema allow you to be anonymous because outside the system, they can't do anything to your PINS. :-)

I think it's objective proof enough. ICICI bank seems to have been affected with malware. Yes Bank, I think was also affected but I cant find the source. 

The worst? National Payments Corporation of India being affected but they of course denied it. 
http://www.financialexpress.com/industry/banking-finance/npci-denies-data-hack-says-systems-fully-secure/371544/ 

So there. There is no concept of security audits; if its there, it's useless. Basically, I feel its a bunch of monkeys sitting over out hard earned money and clueless on how things are getting worse. I wish I could use stronger profanity! ",blackberry_rad," True Caller is a bigger threat to your identity than Whats App, i can easily get your Email ID and FB profile without your consent if any of your friends have them linked to your contact details.... [removed] >Fraudsters get your personal details (easily available through WhatsApp)

How? Do they hack Whatsapp or whatsapp willingly just hand over user data(which is bread and butter of FB) to any wannabe ?

For reference - https://www.eff.org/node/82654

 I work in a company which  has largest market share in banking software. These products assist banks to maintain security, DB, financial rules like BASEL and many other things.I work in RDBMS and big data maintenance along with cloud encryption. So, let me tell you a thing or two on how this system works.

First of all, simply by knowing your phone number using whatsapp will not be sufficient to hack a bank. It's like throwing a pebble on a lion at some kung-fu nerve and hoping to kill it. It's ridiculous so I will not even justify discussing this here because it's not quora and assume people over here to just use their logic a little. 

Now let us assume discussion is about hacking an individual's bank account, phishing is the most reliable way to do it. But be always aware to check if the website you have opened is https or not. It is a very basic thing. **NEVER OPEN LINKS USING YOUR MAIL ACCOUNT.** Phishing basically fools you to think that you are logging in to a bank but it is a private page of a hacker and you are basically texting him your password by typing over there. Now any hacker can easily deceive google security by making a hash code which he can crack easily so you wouldn't be notified by google too that this page is a security risk. Then there are other ways too. OTPs come on your phone and in more than a few cases, locked phones prompts the message on screen and OTP can be seen from that screen. This wouldn't be hacking but more like theft. **This btw is the best and to my knowledge the only way to hack into your friend's facebook account**. There are other ways too but phishing is the most common. It is like a king's pawn opening with many varities of its own. Usually a hacker develops his own way to phish but in 99% of the cases that involves sending you a mail and you opening a link through it or using your intranet or VPN to deceive the router.

>Indian banking system under attack!

This headline though is not about individual attacks on users but about an attack on a bank itself i.e. injecting your malware in their servers to redirect you to phishing or anywhere from bank's servers directly. It is very much possible for high end hackers but they will be caught by the system easily. One of my company's software provide three layers of security after authentication which is almost impossible to break. Other products provide microservices to enhance security over different modules. Banks hire other firms solely to enhance security and have their own departments to enhance it even more. Banks have multiple servers and their multiple back ups in multiple locations through which data traverse while your authentication happens. So physically hacking a server may get you past first layer but not other layers. Now using cyber attacks to go past all the servers is very very very tough. It's like landing on moon tough. ~~Countries who have that capability can do that~~ Then again, their are people with advanced brains and skills who dream of owning an island so theoretically they also might do it.  But a malware which redirects you to a different webpage through a bank's server is also possible but would be detected in milliseconds. Such a malware can remain in system to attack for that 1 millisecond for a few times but then again transactions are extremely hard to do even after knowing your passwords because banks detects IP jumps, have OTP verification process, have card grids any many other ways to ensure transaction is done by you and not by someone else.

TL;DR  : Even if someone puts a malware in a bank which is **extremely tough** and that easily detectable, he might get an idea of your bank balance but he can't do transactions. These are mostly rumors to shake stock markets by targeting those non-technical, superstitious and no chicken on Tuesday stock dealers.

Knowledge nugget: Start using Kali linux if you feel like hacking into your friend's computers and using their webcams and microphones. Start with creating word document with a listener and mailing it to your friend and ensuring that he opens the attachment. You will start making your own ways once you get addicted to it. Edit: OP has made some effort to actually try and substantiate his position, while several other comment threads are on random threats you can face online.

Firstly to OP, good on you for focus. 

As to why this doesnt count as proof - 

Articles 1 and 2, both link to articles on the same phishing attacks being targeted at ICICI users 

Article 3, talks about 

> India's third-largest private-sector bank Axis Bank   has appointed auditing firm EY to probe a cyber attack that came to its notice last month, a report in the Economic Times  says.

> The ET report said Axis was contacted by an engineer from Moscow-based Kaspersky anti-virus firm who told the bank that he had discovered a bug in Axis' systems while carrying out a separate probe. The bank has filed a report with the Reserve Bank of India appraising it of the situation. 

Firstly, if you are bringing E&Y to check your code... well, now you have 2 problems. (3, KASPERSKY has gotten in touch with you, and someone decides to go with E&Y? Wtf?)

There is something more material in that article here: 
>In June this year, the Reserve Bank of India had formulated a comprehensive policy that it wants banks to roll out. The guidelines outline an indicative set of baseline cyber security and resilience requirements,  steps to set up a ""cyber security operation centre"" and a template for reporting incidents to the central bank

But again, this is not proof that there is an Attack on the Indian banking system. Suggestive, but also business as normal for people to create and implement policy and security improvements.

Article 4 - 
> Public sector Union Bank of India on Friday said one of the bank‚Äôs offshore accounts was breached in a cyber attack but the money trail was traced and movement of funds was blocked.

Again, the fact that banks are targeted is not new. If there were multiple attempts to physically rob banks we would say theres a *spree* of bank robberies. Not that there is an attack on the banking system. You would have to prove that all these attacks are linked and designed to damage/bring down the Indian banking system.


Finally - theres 2 articles on security breaches. Sadly they happen. But again, bad net sec does not an attack make.


Again, extraordinary claims, extraordinary proof. You have to show that there is a sustained, organized and directed attack on the Indian Banking system. Not that Indian banks have still to improve their security.

 
------------
Wth?

Dude, proof or gtfo. For this to be an issue you would need to have a fraudulent transaction rate Increase across all banks.

This is something checked on a daily basis and if there was a rise or a spike, it would be an issue discussed or raised elsewhere.

You are making an implicit accusation and an explicit one.

1) Indian banking system is under attack

2) since it is being attacked and no one is aware about it, people checking errors and fraud are either zombies or sweeping it under the rug or are not bringing it to the authorities 

Either claim is extraordinary and for extraordinary claims there needs to be extraordinary proof.

Provide the proof.

  Seems like a forwarded WhatsApp spam message.
 Awareness about skimmers, Phishing, Vishing is the key. End user is too naive to understand this. As a security professional I took it as my personal responsibility to make my friends & family members aware about secure practices while using cards offline or online, while using social media & while browsing internet & about how to identify & avoid suspicious emails. Chip + PIN is not entirely safe. I posted here few weeks back about an incident where ‚Çπ 20k were withdrawn from my account using a debit card at an ATM in a different city whereas the card was with me all the time. Luckily the bank (HDFC) credited the amount back in around 3 weeks, which is great but not sure if every other bank does it. To add when this happened, a bank official told me this has been happening with many people of late so I think some fuck up has happened with our banking system. Only option is to use cash now or keep your account balance low till it gets better, which I don't know how or when is gonna get.  Its actually not that hard to prevent you from reading smses from banks. You dont even need to fake an ID to do that

You can get an sms bomber for as cheap as 5 dollars and Call bomber for 10 dollars.

Point being, If a fraudster already has your bank details there is very little you can do to protect yourself. So get yourself the chip + pin cards like op says to better protect yourself. Source? As a security engineer I would like to spend extra million dollars to put few cisco NAC appliances next to firewall. Also will be strict allowing thumb drives on any bank peripherals. 

I wil put all windows xp machines behind secondary  firewall, they are very easy to hack in to while upgrading any windows servers that are still windiws 2000.

 ‚Å†‚Å†‚Å†I worked at EY briefly in their computer security division in the US some 14-15 years ago - they existed mainly to give a clean chit to the customer. They would bill heavily (my rate was like $600 an hour), make a big dog and pony show of conducting an audit, officially report only the most obvious mistakes, and work with the customer to ensure their public image was well managed. 

I quit working there mainly because of the huge gap between my ethical expectations and theirs.

The same EY is now auditing Axis. Kek. Dude listen, many of us here are tenured cyber security professionals from various industries. This happens all the time. The links that you have shared are aping each other because some company that sells some product or services related to the security domain has decided to make noise about these happenings and fix up a few presales calls with the bankers. 
The articles don't talk about how often these things happen or how many findings and incidents are under remediation as we type..


We saw a similar global buzz of articles when Fireeye used the Target breach for publicity a few years ago...
You still see them appear now and then in the media trying to make noise about breaches by APTs of state actors and China in particular. 


This wave is local to India. All I can say is Indian banking industry stays compliant to RBIs guidelines for information security as a guidance. They are loosely based on ISO 27k. There are frequent notifications from RBI related to new risks and threats that should be acted upon. 


There are industry specific threats and malware and the controls in place usually keep any major incidents from occurring. IT risk forms an important part of the Basel 3 standard too and measuring and managing the risks is a well oiled component. The risk exposure of a bank decides the capital needed as collateral to be kept with the RBI to offset any issues. None of these breaches are big enough to cause a major impact on the health of these banks.


We have a new Governor at the RBI signing notes. At the most, this collation of incidents into a bouquet could be an attempt to spook him into issuing a notification could benefit a certain group of vendors... don't read too much into it.
 It happens all the time. Everywhere. Banks are common targets. 

Unless you know and can tell us something groundbreaking, this sounds like WhatsApp forward I fear the botnet so I always register at places with a number different from the one registered with the bank. Is this a concerted attack over the last few days and do we have reason to believe that *Neighborly State Actors* could be directing this ? Lol, its so easy to hack a bank. Tons of branches especially of SBI, Canara are still using Windows XP machines, un-updated, un-patched and probably using a pirated version. You could load up a malware in pendrive, do some stupid social engineering to get them to insert your pendrive and you're done. Ohh, and I think they're still using IE6 or something. My Citibank credit card was skimmed and 48000 INR was withdrawn and that's the max limit for cash withdrawal. Fortunately I am in a different country with the card in hand with me and skimmed card was used in India. I was able to provide all the proof that I am out of country and prove that I have the card and Citibank might credit the amount back.

It was Chip and Pin card and yet it's not secure. Nothing is fraud proof. 

Some tips :
Never be lazy shout out the pin number at fuel or hotel places. It takes a minute to walk out of the car or your seat to insert the card yourself and enter the pin. 

Put a tape on the number and better to memorize Not trying to call this a clickbait or anything, but there is no need to push that red panic button either. One thing to remember is that if you take care of basic things like not sharing your passwords or any personal info with anyone, no harm can usually befall upon you.

And sorry, I don't think that the people guarding our financial systems are clueless. Had that been the case, there would have been panic everywhere - you and me would not be doing e-commerce transactions on flipkart in a relaxed manner, and people would still be carrying nothing but cash and gold bullion on them.

Such untoward incidents do happen sometimes, but there are so many checks and balances in the economy that the person doing such frauds are easily caught within days, it doesn't pay to do this for long term. >> moving away from WhatsApp is a sensible decision (use BBM/ Threema) so that your identity details through phone numbers is not compromised.

Can you explain? I was at a ATM yesterday and this guy came to me and asked if I have credit card, although I don't I told him I do just to make him go away. Then he asked me my name and phone number. I gave him my phone number. Can I be in trouble?  http://profit.ndtv.com/news/industries/article-banks-on-guard-after-data-security-breach-at-private-lender-1476576 The ideal solution would be to withdraw all of the amount or transfer it to a non-indian bank, right?

#But wait... the Bill says 'Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services'. How are they allowed to do these *other* things?
___

There has been a lot of debate for years about the Aadhaar card. On March 16, Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016 was passed as a money bill. During the debate, our finance minister said time and again that the Aadhaar cards will be used specifically for providing subsidies and other financial benefits. He *said* it, but if anyone had bothered to take a peek into the proposed bill, they would have understood what was going on. 

But alas, the bill was brought on a Friday, our representatives had to fly back home. It's [""Take out the Trash"" day](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4l3qup/how_pleb_mps_try_to_impose_their_will_and_fail/)! So, meh.

*For a detailed analysis of what the Aadhaar Bill contains and why it was passed a s money bill, [read this](http://www.policypeepul.com/blog/2016/5/11/the-aadhar-bill-is-it-a-risk-worth-taking)*

**Changing the bill *after* it becomes an Act**

Aye. That can be done. 

There is a whole **Clause 54** left lying around titled ""Power of Authority to make Regulations"" in the [passed Aadhaar Act, 2016](http://egazette.nic.in/WriteReadData/2016/168717.pdf). This particular clause lets the government change multiple aspects of the bill by issuing notifications. These notifications are then supposed to be laid formally in both houses of Parliament once the next session begins.

[Clause 54: Regulations rock peepal!](http://imgur.com/A5DXwmx)

[MOAR REGULATIONS!](http://imgur.com/q5hLCrm)


Look at these particular subsections. The government can change provisions for any of these *without the prior approval of Parliament*:

- [Biometric Information](http://imgur.com/i4lD5oS)

- [Other purposes](http://imgur.com/wqW7aPQ)

- [Other tech safeguards](http://imgur.com/xrJZpCO)

- [Maintaining, updating and deletion of Aadhaar numbers](http://imgur.com/3xhjdhm)

All of these subsections are so bloody vague that they can cover anything that a citizen does. What the heck does ""other purposes"" even mean?!

I have never seen anyone in Parliament challenging a notification. Many Acts are slyly changed in this manner. Please note (before you start outraging about how evil the present government is), this phenomenon is not something that was started by the Modi government, all governments in the past have been doing it in one way or the other. By keeping the wordings vague in the proposed bill itself, it gives a leeway for the executive to change it at a later date without consulting Parliament.

But... this has to stop somewhere, right? RIGHT?

___
#What can we do about it now?
___
Well, nothing, I‚Äôm afraid. I just wanted to put it out there. The only public intervention possible was *before* the Bill became an Act.  

Unless the [Supreme Court strikes down the Aadhaar Act‚Äôs validity](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4g34n7/an_important_supreme_court_hearing_is_coming_up/) or says it‚Äôs an invasion of the fundamental right to privacy, the public can‚Äôt do anything about it except watch & get Aadhaar cards in the process. 

If the SC *does* strike the Act down, I‚Äôm afraid it might be too late. The government is already on an overdrive to get maximum Aadhaar registrations. They are claiming that more than a billion people are now registered, even Aanganwaadis and Government hospitals are doing daily drives to get newborns registered.


I will end with a quote by a wise fictional one eyed man called Alastor ‚ÄúMad Eye‚Äù Moody:

Fin.

EDIT: Added a link to a detailed post on the Aadhaar Bill and its various provisions.",kumbhakaran," I don't like where this is going. A biometric way of identification should be implemented to protect one's identity, not be given to MNCs who can invent ways to isolate people based on their unique identification. 

Why are bills and laws being passed with vague terminology and wording? The largest democracy in the world is proving to be the most retarded democracy in protecting its own people and their interests. 

Even after such loopholes are discovered and exposed, the Supreme Court is just sitting on its ass and not doing anything to correct the flawed system. If such an attitude is displayed by the highest authority of the country, why do we even respect the institution named ""Supreme Court""??!! To be more precise, what respect does the Supreme Court exhibit towards the common man??? I used to be one of the ""meh, why such a ruckus about Aadhar's biometrics"", but I must say, this shit is truly scary now. Orwellian seems to be the word.

Stuff like Iris enabled tabs are still in their early stages and cost might be a factor, but a decade from now, a govt could do whatever it wants with this.

Also that rule about FIR's is fucking silly. Assume I get mugged, how in fuck am I supposed to remember my Aadhar card number? Retarded shit. Do we have Right to Privacy though? 

Article 21 says : No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.

Any lawyers who can clear up please? Most people here have not deciphered the government's game plan on Aadhar. Basically, it wants to side step and push until one can get it via underhanded tactics. So, technically it might not be required but they will push it as they know courts have a high turn around time. By then, they would have achieved their REAL objective - mass collection of  data.
 [deleted] awesome writeup. govt is trying their best to shove aadhar down our throats. looks like soon i'm going to be deprived of basic amenities because i lack Aadhar card (proliferation in Bengal is not much still) I did not want to make aadhar account. But then I was forced to because my new employer, an US based MNC, made it mandatory.

Is it legal for foreign based companies to ask for you aadhar card? I am not able to wrap my head around this issue, so guys help me here please. 

**Identification** - OP and others have given examples of Aadhaar being required for authentication and identification in various scenarios. Things like, FIR, Attendance, Skype calls with Govt, deliverance of government services and subsidies etc. 

At the basic level we all know for a fact that identification is required for all these things. 

Now why is Aadhar number & card (as a proof od identity and residence) worse than pan-card, license, passport, ration-card, electricity-bill, phone-bill, bpl card, bank statement etc? 

If just one single card/identification-proof works for most-things (where we need identification/authentication) why is it bad?

Is it an issue with us being **forced**? Like there is no compulsion to own/have any of the identifications like pan-card etc, I mentioned above, but we are indirectly being pushed to have Aadhar cards? 

But there again for various stuff we have been forced to get these cards. Like a pan-card is not compulsory in theory but becomes so when you start earning. Or a passport, license, ration-card under different circumstances. 

**Biometrics** - It eases the authorization/identification and reduces the chances of frauds and scams. mobile banking transactions might actually become more secure with these. 

**Misuse**- This is a concern which is very valid. But how and under what circumstances? Are we looking at real threats or just far-fetched fiction?

**Methodologies adopted by the govt** - As the OP mentioned that the way Aadhar Bill was passed and there is clause which can enable the govt to make changes aren't really kocher. However, aren't we mixing up the two things. What's done and how it got done are two different subjects. Wrong way does not make Aadhar itself wrong. 

Happy to change my opinion. Is there an NGO where I can donate which would fight against Aadhaar in Supreme Court? I will not take Aadhaar unless the SC says there is no way out. > other purposes

> other technology safeguards

So, I bothered checking out section 23.

Subsection 1 puts execution of process of issue completely in the ""authority's"" hands.

Clause (t) of subsection 2 goes like this --
>(t) such other powers and functions as may be prescribed.

Are you fucking kidding me? So the existing govt can do whatever the hell it wants with UID data.

All hell breaks loose if something open to interpretation like ""other"" creeps into contract or tender documents. Too bad we don't subject legislative bills to same standards. will resists getting this card as much as posible, lets see how long we can survive Let's just wait till the database get hacked, as some self-important Babu was too self-important and missed the deadline to submit two notorized copies of the form for updating the OS and anti spyware on the servers for better protection, and the Parliamentary Appropriations Subcommittee for Software Services to Adhar and Other Purposes doesn't retroactively allow any software updates until the next budget cycle.  How well is our database secured and who is privy to this information is the big question.  Such a complicated situation. If this was in the hands of a more unbiased government (like uh... uh...) I'd feel safer. This + smart city initiative is really panning out to be an Orwellian landscape. I can't tell if it's just the usual tech paranoia of things changing rapidly and people remaining as good/bad as they already are, or the possibility of an intense dictatorship.

Good thing the Indian govt is shitty at execution! Adhaar ~ ""Aam aadmi ka adhikaar"" my ass. The ""wild wild west"" days of technology are over. It is slowly being institutionalized using Aadhaar and other means. IMO this was a predictable step in the trend of adoption of modern tools for progress of the country.

You may call it a trojan but I say this is the govt's equivalent to a google/facebook tracking cookie. To serve the best interests of all participants, Aadhar needs to be omniscient and omnipresent. I am glad that Aadhar is the defacto identification system. If the Govt makes it the only number or identification required that would be even better.                  
Privacy is a boogeyman argument. Some institution has to have a list of people who are Indians or living in India,  which is obviously the government.  If anyone wants to transact with the government or society needs to have an identification.  That's the basic requirement.  I suppose it is free and doesn't require renewal or running around to get one.           
It is a good approach to prototype in small areas of government schemes before widening it further. Provides opportunities for scaling and error corrections. Nothing sneaky about it.         
It is entirely voluntary as well. There is no forced drive to enrol anyone.           
Only issue with Aadhar is they could have made it into citizenship proof.         
Glad to see there are technical progress into making Aadhar compatible tablets and mobiles.           
Very good initiative. Why there is no PIL in the Supreme Court? Ah, not-again the conspiracy theorists & luddites !

Look, lets get 2 things straight - which you probably would agree with too

1) To improve efficiency & governance, it helps a lot if every citizen has a unique ID.

2) NO system can be risk free, there will always be ways to break it. The best the architects can do, is to make the breaches difficult


Now, if you agree with #1, then you need to accept #2 as acceptable risk.

If you disagree with #1, then you probably don't understand how e-governance works. If you want to know what real constant surveillance is then open your Google dashboard. Locations, voice search, market targeting and now there is this ""ok Google""  the phone is constantly listening.  I bet NSA has a back door to everything.  Providing Adhar as a proof gives immediate results, try doing it for your next sim card.
If not doing any illegal things, then why worry about privacy. The data ending up in wrong hands is only valid worry, and is called a breach. Irctc having a breach turned out fake. Sure govt has a full proof contract with data management provider. Your freedom and your privacy is not because of lack of technology. It's because we the people have decided to govern ourselves this way. 

You have more power than you realize and the government has less than you think. Stop thinking of the Indian state as an Orwellian entity. It isn't and if it becomes, the blame can only be on us. Aadhaar would have no hand in that.",2016-06-16 18:32:03
Business/Finance,What does r/India think of Bitcoin? India must act now or miss out on this emerging technology.,42,6f3v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6f3v9z/what_does_rindia_think_of_bitcoin_india_must_act/,29,"Bitcoin currently has grown so much in size that its market cap is bigger than any of USA's top airlines. Yes, these are Airlines like Delta with hundred's and hundreds of Boeing airplanes in their fleet connecting every city of America yet a simple technology run on a computer has usurped all these airlines. No mean feat. 

Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming. 

Meanwhile Indian Gov is actively trying to play down BTC, some ministers are still calling it scam, play of the devil, likening it with ""chit funds"" etc. What the fuck is wrong with the finance brains and the IT brains of our country that we (as a country) are missing out on the biggest IT development since world wide web thanks to illiterates talking their talk. 

And Im not talking about middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" - Bitcoin was invented to cut these middlemen out of the chain, yet these are the ones who are profiting selling BTC to Indians at a 25% markup price and taking a hefty commission. 

We are also giving a big play to more middle men companies like PayTM who are trying to reinvent the currency wheel and are doing such a bad job at it, yet most Indians will tell you that PAYTM is the best and Bitcoin is a scam. Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them - yet PAYTM is such a big rage here - outdated technology, very poor profitablity, the PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm.


Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020, but by that time the world would have already moved on and derived the most out of bitcoin. Many businesses are already hedging their funds vs BTC or investing part of their profits into BTC and the growth of 2500% since 2015 will only make more companies turn to BTC. 

Im sure many smart Indians have already started to see the potential of BTC, lets use this thread to discuss the market in India. ",WishYouWereHear," You do know that Bitcoin cannot be regulated and a ban would only hamper the perceived sovereignty of INR.  No problem with bitcoin gaining popularity, but the reading the replies of OP here, it seems he created this post to shove his point of view up others asses rather than to listen to their point of views. Ok, I'll bite. 

> Australia and Japan have completely legalized BTC and it is being used as tender for everything from grocery to cars, South Korea as well, even Malaysia's btc market is booming.

Sure they have. But is it illegal in India or USA ? If tomorrow Amazon decides that it will accept payments in Gold , Bitcoins or any legal doohickeys , can they prosecute Amazon ? This is NOT a rhetorical question so please feel free to answer.


Plus why would I buy anything using a bitcoin today if as you say yourself "" ...will make you rich over time if you just put a $100 in there today"" ? 

Some people were not fortunate as you are today. They knew that in a year their Tulip could have fetched more than an entire country , but unfortunately they could not preserve it. We don't have that problems with BTC. So lets never use them till each BTC is worth a gazillion kabillion dollars.

> ...middle men like ""Zebpay"" and ""Unocoin"" ...

How in the fricking hell do you think an average Amit in India or an average Joe in Europe will be buying a BTC ? Do you fucking suppose that they will mine the BTC ? Have you ever heard of coindesk ? Exchanges ? Tumblers ? Are these being run as cooperatives ? Is Satoshi running these ?

> Currency wallets (payment banks) are outdated by atleast 5 years, they were big in 2010 in the USA and today nobody uses them

I suppose Paypal , and the newly introduced Google Wallets , Amazon pay , Samsung Pay, Apple Pay , Isis wallet are just barely hanging in there with NOBODY using them. Starbucks processing more than 8 million transactions each week on its own wallet is just an alternate fact , ain't it ! 

> PAYTM business exists only to support its CEO and turn him into a Billionaire while the rest of the PAYTM user base suffers from lack of basic communication access with Paytm

Are there businesses which are NOT supposed to support the CEO and its shareholders to become a billionaire ?

If you feel that Paytm suffers from lack of basic communication , well , no one is forcing you to use it.

> Make no mistake, India will follow the rest of the world eventually, as we always do, and end up accepting BTC in 2020

Indian banks trying out blockchains - 
http://www.coindesk.com/indias-bankchain-consortium-launches-blockchain-kyc-system/

The fricking behemoths that are SBI , ICICI and HDFC are already investing into the blockchain tech.
RBI is all for it . Niti Aayog has been exploring it. 

But you still would go on that this is different from using the BTC because BTC is the snake oil that you are selling. Not the technology behind the snake oil !

Offtopic : The WannaCry ransomware was targeting people who still had XP or were using unpatched systems even after being warned by MS about the extra ordinary vulnerabilities. Now, the BTC is not something that is as easy as straightforward as opening a paypal or heck even an account in some despot-led tax haven country. 

I wonder if there were people ready to throw money at the hackers but could not understand the ABC of a BTC !


Another Offtopic : I read a book (or watched a documentary, can't remember) wherein some biologists and psychiatrists mentioned that the bubbles actually cause lunacy like symptoms. They did some fun studies to illustrate this and they took like brain scans as well. It was stupid enough that I dismissed it, but if anyone knows what I am talking about , please link me that book. call me old-school, I don't believe in bitcoins, investing in it is just nothing more than gambling. if few key players who owns the majority chunk of bitcoins will cash it out, it would never regain it's current market value, and that's just one possibility how it can go down, there are bazillion other possibilities that can cause the crash, meanwhile there is absolutely no assurance by any key economist, IMF, world bank that it's have any reliability and reason to stay. 

also there is a big myth that it bitcoins can be transferred instantaneously, in reality conformation of transaction take hours.

quite recently economist have published a very sensible article [""*What if bitcoin bubble bursts?*""](http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21722841-latest-frenzy-tulip-mania-gold-rush-or-dotcom-boom-what-if-bitcoin-bubble), I suggest everyone to give it a read, and please do think thrice before 'investing' in bitcoins. Now is a really bad time to get into BTC.  
Heading for a crash very soon, wait for that. We discuss cryptocurrency every second day here. Here is the latest discussion - 
https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6ec6az/npwhy_arent_you/ If one is so sure about it's acceptance then the next logical step is to invest in it and make a windfall when it is finally accepted. I don't think they will ever understand the tech behind blockchains in public sector.. Atleast not until the govt jobs are taken by merit and not by reservations.. It will be interesting to see the financial system in India collapse if this blockchain's catch up. We are in a dire need for this especially when our dear PM started a trend to ban fiats and every political party will join bandwagon.. Bitcoin is a interesting technology, far from mass adoption and with huge scaling problems. I would recommend you to invest in other gambling options, like blackjack or poker, in order to spread your speculation portfolio.",2017-06-04 11:45:03
Business/Finance,Stay in an excellent job vs come back to live with my family?,33,65nu2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/65nu2c/stay_in_an_excellent_job_vs_come_back_to_live/,47,"I am in a very big dilemma right now. I have to choose between staying in my current job in Netherlands and become a wealthy man or going back to my own country and stay with my family(and not be so wealthy).

Background:

A bit of a background, I come from a south asian (pakistan,india,bangladesh) country where I lived with my family. I live with my mom, brother and little sister. I am 28 years old and not married. I am responsible for the finances of my house. So i pay for everything, including the college fee of my brother and sister and daily expenses such as food, electricity, rent etc. The college fee is done now as they are both in their last semester. Although, I will still be responsible for our daily expenses.

I recently went to the Netherlands and studied there for two years. I got a degree and even found a really nice job.

I have two options to choose from:

**Option 1: Stay at my current Job in Netherlands**

I have a really nice job in the Netherlands. There is such a big difference in the working conditions that I don't think I can work as a software engineer when I come back home.

My one month's salary in Netherlands is equal to my 3-4 months salary in my own country. In fact the difference in salary is so big that I dont think I can work as a software engineer when I go back home. It will just feel wrong to me to do the same type of work for 1/4th of the money.

Almost all companies treat you like a human in the Netherlands. They have really nice laws about employment law. I don't have to work overtime and even if I do work overtime, I will be paid for the overtime. This is not the case in my own country. In my country they expect you to work overtime and think you are not motivated if you refuse. And they will never pay you for overtime.

In the Netherlands you can be on sick leave for a maximum of two years and still get paid salary. Though it is not so common to be sick for so long but it is really comforting to know. In my country they start deducting your holidays when you are sick. And when all of your holidays are gone then they start deducting your salary. And if you dont show up after two months then there is a big chance you will be let go.

Besides my job, I have other benefits in the Netherlands. I have been on so many dates in the Netherlands which was not so easy in my country. Online dating is still non-existent in my country. I currently have a girlfriend in the Netherlands. I feel really free and independent in terms of dating. I can go to anyone's house and invite any girl in my own house I also have nice public transport, online shopping for almost all video games, books, clothes etc. I have a really nice gym. The only career i can think of having when I go back is do my own business.

While living in Netherlands has good points, there are also some bad things. There are some things that make me hate Netherlands sometimes. If I stay there for one year without a holiday then I get really miserable. I really miss my family on my holidays. I also feel that they sometimes look at us in a condescending way.I have had a lot of incidents related to racism. It seems like they feel like they are much better than us. I have been asked all sorts of questions like : Is there a tv in your country? Do you have internet in your country? Do you know what a washing machine is ? Sometimes people give me a look of disgust even. And they get more weird if they know I am a muslim. 
 
**Option 2: Go back to my home country and live with my family**

I mentioned a lot of really nice things in the first option but I really miss my family and my country's food. My mom is always very sad when my holidays are up and I have to go back. She is always crying when I leave. She said that I can stay in the Netherlands for as long as I want but she is happy when I am around. My little sister also misses me. She told me that I should come back next year. She is going to be married in a few years then I wont be able to see her so often. When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

Regarding finances, i will have around 20k$ of savings by next year. What is your opinion?",aznten," Stay in nederdraad. Visit once twice a year. You won't regret long term.  It's at such times only that you have to decide your priorities in life, and develop and follow your principles. I personally believe in this - ""The quality of your life is the quality of your relationships"". A poor person can be quite happy if surrounded by people he loves. A very rich man will not be happy without loved ones.

That said, things are more complicated. Employment and infrastructure is bad in India. And it's not always that our family or relationships will be good. So you have to decide whether things are worth it.

One idea probably is to work in your prime years abroad, earn a shitload of money, marry a desi import or someone okay with moving to India, save your money, and return to India in time for your kids to go to college. And retire here. All the while visiting as much as you can, to keep in touch with family and also making arrangements for your future.

Or another one is to take the leap of faith, return to your motherland, try and work to do your bit to improve this country, and save your wife and kids the trauma of moving.

Staying there, you will always remain an outsider. And so will your kids, be them desi or mixed race. I wouldn't want that for my children. Family sticks when no one will. Your 'friends' and 'neighbours' won't take care of you when you're‚Äã sick or grow old. I am in no way expert, but try to earn as much as possible there and then move back as the other guy said. Buy everything you need here while working there (car, house, maybe savings for marriage and kids) and then find a job here before moving back. It will be rough but smoothen it out with money.

Is there any possibility that your parents can fly over to Netherlands for maybe 2-3 months in-between for just traveling and will ease the homesickness while allowing them to also enjoy?

 Stay. With family it's ""door ki cheez sona, pass ki cheez chapal."" , your value diminishes as long as you be with your family. Catch 22.
Based on my experience, I still have not found any answer to this question.
But stay in ND till you find a way out. Seems your mind says Netherlands, but your heart says India. FWIW, the software industry in India has improved over the last few years. There is considerable foreign investment in the market right now and if you display your skills well, you can make comparable money. Also, years of interacting with the west and many NRIs coming back has resulted in some of that culture rubbing off. If you know where to look for, you will find places that value employee well being as a means to overall productivity. Keep away from the big four obviously. I think you should stay there. 
&nbsp;

You have mentioned that you can fly your mother there but there is no one to look after you siblings? But you also mentioned that your sibling(s) are about to graduate? I think they can manage staying alone for a couple of weeks. 
&nbsp;

Talk to them about it. And later, they can accompany your mum too! I'm not sure if I'm the right guy for this, but you should ask yourself instead of strangers. 100 people will give 100 different answers. Ultimately you are responsible for your own life. Don't leave NL or stay there just because 90% of the subreddit says so. Its your life and you alone should make the choice. Nobody here has any idea of your thoughts, beliefs, values etc. Personally I would quit my comforts to live with my family regardless of them giving me any bhaw or not. Its because I love them. I would do that. But that doesn't mean you should too. Flip a coin, while its in the air, the result you hope for is the correct choice. As for a personal opinion, money and good lifestyle can only get you so far. The ultimate thing is being happy inside. And if being with your family makes you happy, then by all means return to your country. It doesn't matter if you've got a villa, a swimming pool and a fuckload of money with 2 yr leave,if you're lonely. If you want to be with your family and it seems like you do take them there or move back home. Its all upto you. Good luck brother. Please do update someday what you did.  Come back to live with your family and make India progress with your incredible talent.  Could you not try and set up your own business from the Netherlands and when this runs well enough move it to India? Software engineering can be done anywhere? 
I am from the Netherlands, I adopted my daughter from India. Since politician Wilders is spouting his hatred she also has a harder time. I am not sure where this will end. Sometimes I fear that Muslims will be the new Jews in another 10 years or so. (My daughters biological parents were most likely Hindu, by the way) Visit often or get your family to Netherlands Stay there...build a good social circle and build a good life. Over time, try and move your family there.  IMO you should Come back only if you have a good plan. Regarding occupation, I've heard some of the start-up's here giving at-least some of the benefits you have mentioned, certainly not the two year sick leave but, your experience will be valued for sure. This post is a reason why I always vote for accepting bullying in adult social situation. You need a kick in the ass for a reality check, being pampered too much these days I see. Stop this drama, grow a pair and get ahead. You know everything you need to, stop trying to seek validation.  > When I am in the Netherlands I have to do everything by myself. But when I am in my own country then my mom takes care of the cooking. We have a maid for cleaning. My brother takes care of all of the groceries. I can go out and buy my country's snacks, street food everyday. I can eat my own food everyday.

from your post I think you need a wife. I'm sure you can get a maid to do cleaning, and order groceries online; where as your wife will cook you your own food.

you need to asses your situation yourself. why are you asking yourself this question. Is it for your comfort or to keep your mother/siblings happy. I see that you've mentioned that you are responsible for running your family. In that case, you could run your family from anywhere in the world as long as you are sure that there is someone you could trust locally that can act as you proxy, which in this case your brother.

your dilemma is that you want to go home, but you don't want to leave this lavish lifestyle you've become accustomed to. Also as an added bonus staying would give you more money for yourself and to run your family.

the real question is would be able to stay away from your family and see them for short intervals in a year. if yes, then stay. If you feel like you're missing the love of your family, and cannot bear the solitude then go back home. Are you the last of a dying breed?  Stay in Netherlands and get epic rich. Visit home atleast twice a year. This may happen https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0dk9vx2yks Bhai, the answer is simple. Ask yourself, love berween your family members is more important or money? Your mother will add fewer  years than you, your sister will go to someone else after a few years and the MONEY, you can burn it in Netherlands if you are feeling cold. 

Sure we are a developing country and we have a hell lot of problems, but I cannot even think of ditching my parents to get 'comfortable' in a developed country. My parents struggled financially, emotionally to raise me, I can't turn my back on them. Whatever happens to them, I will stay with them. Money, that comes later. Love and happiness of my family members collectively is paramount. Get new family in Netherlands. Maybe 2 more families somewhere on the side.j/k

 Stay in Netherlands, continue to do your job. In your extra time research and try to start your business (DON'T QUIT YOUR JOB). 

If your business lifts off :

1. You'll have much more money for your family (think sister's marriage/ brother's education).
2. You can move your family there and settle down.
3. You can quit your job and run that business from India while earning money (and spending less).

If your business doesn't lift off :

1. This will help you find faults in your approach, so that you can refine your business model.
2. Keep working at your job, build more experience. Then apply to a bigger company for more salary.

Best of luck with life and such! Visit some night spots in Amsterdam.. have some magic cakes .. feel good .. enjoy the moment..  You asked in the wrong place, mate.

People on this subreddit are so desperate to escape India for some reason, they will immediately tell you to stay in Europe. WTF?This is such a stupid doubt to have .

AFAIK he is good friends with Raghu. And new enemy of my macro economics teacher is born. Patel is an excellent choice. I've followed the RBI statements in the last few months and you can just tell how much Rajan trusts him. He always comes across as very knowledgable and informed, while at the same time humble and zero arrogance.

I think this will be a very good pick. I doubt he'll do the bidding of what Modi and his team want, Patel is part of the system in RBI. He takes its independence *very* seriously.

 I was worried that amidst NPA crisis they will make Bhattacharya the Governor. I am happy that at least there is no conflict of interest. [Live Blog: Urjit Patel Named RBI Governor]

Business/Finance,Our Banks are in trouble & we need to talk about it,423,47ogw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/47ogw5/our_banks_are_in_trouble_we_need_to_talk_about_it/,93,"Amidst the prolonged JNU controversy &amp; Jat Quota stir, one big development is constantly being ignored for the past two weeks. Our Banks (PSBs) have declared they have [4.4 lakh crore](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/at-rs-4-lakh-crore-bad-loans-exceed-market-value-of-psu-banks/articleshow/51078318.cms) worth Non Performing Assets (NPAs) as of December 2015. 

Here, I will attempt to break it all down in layman terms. What, why, when and how it affects us, the taxpayer. I'm no finance expert, so please point out any errors I make. I had to go through a lot of complicated jargon (it's weird how these things are always so complicated) to make sense of it.

**What are NPAs and why should we care?**

Loans whose three consecutive installments are not paid are classified as Non Performing Assets (NPAs). After an NPA or bad loan is declared, the bank can initiate the process of recovery and restructuring of that loan. It will try to get new management to run projects, auction off collateral and try to recover the amount, which is rarely equivalent to the amount of loan given. Especially in case of big loans. 

The NPAs that have been declared recently are mostly by big corporate borrowers (according to some sources, around 65-70% of total defaulters are big corps). Take the example of Vijay Mallaya. Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore. Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore. 

On top of it, [Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits](http://profit.ndtv.com/news/budget/article-vijay-mallya-resigns-from-united-spirits-gets-rs-515-crore-1281435?pfrom=home-lateststories) and got a payout of ~~$515 million~~ Rs 515 crore. Good times for him while the 17 banks unitedly struggle to recover the loan amount. 

**So if the loans can't be recovered, what happens to the banks?** 

Simply put, they register losses, throw up their hands and tell the Government, ""Sorry [boss, can't get these loans back](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/banking/finance/banking/state-run-banks-like-sbi-bank-of-baroda-central-bank-of-india-apprise-pm-narendra-modi-of-rising-bad-loans/articleshow/50990898.cms). We need to make profits. Pliss to help."" 

**What will the Government do about this?**

One word: Bailout. 
This whole thing is turning into a big cluster fuck. 'Sources' have been saying the government is planning to infuse Rs 70,000 crore till 2019 into PSBs to calm things down. They have already infused Rs 20,000 crore this year. This amount will not help banks deal with the problem in totality but it's a temporary measure to ensure they don't just collapse under the weight of NPAs. 

**Does that Government have enough money to save the banks?**

No. 

Here's a few things which the government has to spend on in the near future:

1) [Food Security Act](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2016-02-03/news/70313785_1_national-food-security-act-prime-minister-narendra-modi-food-subsidy) 

2) [MGNREGA](http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2016/02/nda-pursuing-mgnrega-bengal-and-up-election/)

3) [Seventh pay commission](http://www.dailyexcelsior.com/of-the-servants-by-the-servants-for-the-servants/)

5) [Increased Defence allocation](http://www.businesstoday.in/union-budget-2016-17/expert-columns/defence-budget-allocation-likely-to-see-minimum-10-per-cent-hike/story/229336.html)

The revenue, on the other hand, doesn't seem that rosy. The government has [kept the fuel prices high](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/excise-duty-hiked-on-petrol-by-re-1litre-on-diesel-by-rs-1-5/) to get excise duty on it. The finance minister has been saying this is being done to reduce our fiscal deficit, which is fair. But then in that case where will the money for 'capital infusion in banks' come from? 

(I have to point out here that the first two expenditure items I mentioned are something that the present government has avoided spending on much till now. I don't blame them because the GST plan didn't really work out, so they have to go on an appeasement spree to calm their voters.)

**Well, that's all dandy well awesome but who's fault is it?**

This problem, unfortunately, cannot be pinned down on a single person or party. So I've made a list! 

1) *Raghuram Rajan / Reserve Bank of India*

The banks have been more or less forced to declare these loans because Raghuram Rajan sent notices telling them to clean up their balance sheets. He did this so that the banks can start a fresh cycle of loan disbursements to boost investment in the country. It's a good move in the long term but it all depends on whether the banks are in a position to handle the burden at this point of time.

A Supreme Court bench recently [pulled up the RBI to ask WTF is happening](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-debts-rbi-supreme-court-bank-defaulters/). 

&gt; The bench headed by Chief Justice asked, ""People are owing thousands of crore to the public banks‚Ä¶ it is a big fraud. Top ten public sector banks have written off Rs 40,000 crore alone in 2015. It is all there in this Indian Express report. Public financial institutions are lending money despite knowing no returns. RBI is supposed to keep a watch on these banks. What are you doing about it?‚Äù

They asked RBI to submit a list of defaulters with loans over Rs 500 crore. To which the RBI replied:

&gt; ‚ÄúThe required information is not available with us. Banks are required to report the bad loans on a consolidated basis.""

Personally, I find this response really strange because a periodic reporting of big loans is done to both the Finance Ministry and RBI. How can they ask the banks to ~~waive off~~ write-off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of who the big defaulters are? 

*2) Manmohan Singh / Previous UPA Government*

If anyone is to blame, it's them. These loans which are being declared NPAs have been given during their time. They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money, but they didn't. So they have left this huge crumbling mass of debt which is all coming out. Like pus from a wound. Ugh.

*3) Narendra Modi / Present NDA Government*

If this capital infusion a.k.a. bailout continues and the economy gets in trouble, the NDA government will be definitely blamed for it. The whole point is that they are now in power and they have to clean up the mess even if they want to blame the previous government for it. The people will not forgive the BJP for a major (possibly catastrophic) economic downturn, no matter who is responsible for it. 

Modi has projected himself, right from the beginning, as the savior of the economy. Now that the economy is facing a challenge, he can't afford to point fingers at UPA. But he will, he most definitely will. Rightfully so, but that won't help matters at all.

*4) Faceless, nameless / The Banks*

Aah yes. These frikkin Bankers. The biggest culprits are the bank managers who are responsible for due diligence before disbursing loans. If there is an NPA in a particular bank branch, the manager is held responsible for it. In case of big loans, the top management has to give approvals and they are also held responsible. 

Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans. 

*5) Big Corporates*

The usual suspects. They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts. Just like Vijay Mallya did. They have, in the past decade or so, taken a lot of loans which are now proving to be bad assets for the banks. Even the Economic survey has pointed out that these [corporate debts are worrisome](http://www.businesstoday.in/opinion/perspective/economic-survey-corporate-debts-consumer-spend-monsoons/story/229607.html). They have called it 'The Twin Balance Sheet Problem'... which makes no sense to me...

Some projects haven't taken off due to land acquisition issues, Infrastructure problems and environmental clearances. There is limited investment coming in from abroad. Therefore, the government was eager to push GST and all of these investment driving schemes for the past two years. Didn't really work out as they planned. Even if they manage to pave the way for these pending projects, the corporations are known to delay and milk them for maximum profits. (Eg: KG Basin, IGI Airport and many more.) 

**So what happens next? Also, TLDR.**

To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

EDIT: Forgot to add one more thing.

Indian Express reported the NPA problem first on [February 9, 2016](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-bad-loan-financial-year-rti-rbi-bank-loan-raghuram-rajan-1140000000000-bad-debts-the-great-govt-bank-write-off/).

Sensex posted the biggest weekly fall in 6 years on [February 12, 2016](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Sensex-posts-biggest-weekly-fall-in-over-6-years/articleshow/50963583.cms) and lost 1,631 points.

EDIT 2: Gold! Thank you kind stranger. ",kumbhakaran," awesome writeup! thank you for taking the time to make the jargon clear to us! While bad on paper - the current scenario is actually better than expected.

The fact that banks have bad loans is an ancient fact of life - these loans extend to many many places, from large firms to small farmers.

It was always expected that some government, would have to intervene ecentually to fix this. It's the NDA who has to handle it, and I fully expect them to handle it. The issue itself is resolved by the bureaucrats and the bankers, with the GoI firmly in the driving seat.

But the issue is always the release of bank funds as largesse. It's a mainstay of Indian politics, in one form or the other. One of the ""unspoken rules"" of the game so far.

The divestiture of PSUs, or stronger oversight/capital norms as a means to constrain loans will help. 

The clean up of banks will be a good thing, and it will allow for loan cycle to occur on the base of a healthy banking sector, which can handle any future negative shock.

Honestly, this is business as expected. It's good that people are upset, but being upset won't make a difference since this is essentially a cyclical feature of the larger economy and our banking/private network.

Rules which are followed, divestment, distance between center/politics and PSU management are the cure - and they've been the cure since the reform process started, but haven't been completed.
 I can add few points on The Banks. My Dad is a Chief Manager of a Public Sector Bank in a Municipal Town based in TN.

Branch Managers/Chief Managers don't like having NPAs on their books either. The problem stems from the Zonal Level. The Zonal Manager assigns quarterly/yearly loan targets to individual branches. Applications for larger (and possibly good) loans that are forwarded to the zonal managers sit on their desks for several weeks, the borrower usually moves on to a Private Bank. Now all that's left is smaller loan applications from shaky applicants, local politicians who wants to build schools/engineering colleges, and activists who would threaten to 'Write to the FM' (This happened a lot during the PC era).  The Zonal Management, despite being sloppy, still expects the Branch Managers to meet the targets. So BMs give the loan and hope it would not become a NPA before they get transferred, so that the live bomb is passed on to the new guy.
With a bit of negotiation with the auditing team and the zonal management, you can avoid declaring few loans as NPA for a bunch of quarters. 

Oh, and I don't even want to speak about the crazy ones that retire as Branch Managers. They go on a loaning spree. Thanks a lot. This is some major issue which no one seems to care about in media. I have been telling this to friends and family and actually no one really cares. 

What concerns me is the part where they might bail out these rich-ass people with public money. That will be unjust. These people have the means to pay back and yet they take advantage of out easy recovery norms.

Irony is banks wouldn't write-off agricultural or small loans as these people are easier to bully and that will result in farmer suicides.

But they are happy to go with all the loss because somewhere we have lenient norms and these wigwigs are the ones who control our economic policies.

Edit: **[The Hindu Editorial on this issue](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/no-bailout-with-taxpayer-money/article8241268.ece)**
 Loans being written off from the books or provisions being kept against bad debt doesn't mean that there won't be recovery. The whole Raghuram Rajan point in the opening post doesn't make sense. That would be like blaming a government which enforces accurate reporting of crimes for increase in crime statistics.

The lowly bank managers have little say in large loans. The decision for the biggest NPAs are taken at least at General Manager level (some even at Chairman level). One needs to investigate these bad loans, seize the assets of willful defaulters and charge the real decision-makers in bank.

The whole issue is that of bankers being browbeaten to give risky debt to industrialists with political connections and the said industrialists refusing to pay up because they know that they have the connections and the power to avoid being hit by any action taken by common bank bankers (different ones from those who gave them loans). Great writeup. Thanks.    
A question: Big corporates (say Vijay Mallya) take huge loans and then are not able to pay back and thus the write off. What does the law do here? Can't it catch the culprits and send them to jail? Or probably auction the properties that were kept as a guarantee while taking loan? I haven't heard of a bigshot (except Sahara) who is sent to Jail for not paying back the money.  Vijay Mallaya is a free man and they fucked up my credit score because i missed one payment on my education loans.

 yenna rascals i tell ya.  > On top of it, Vijay Mallya just resigned from United Spirits and got a payout of $515 million.

Rs515cr not $million. Pedantic but couldn't resist because of my intermittent OCD. sorry. 

>How can they ask the banks to waive off loans worth lakhs of crores without having an estimate of how the big defaulters are?

The Banks know who are the borrowers and RBI does not, so this is not an issue. 

Secondly, the loans are not being waived (as in cancelled or forgiven/forgotten). That's a wrong and dangerous word to use in this context. 

The loans are being written off. What that means is, as you say earlier in you post, that once the borrower has failed to service the loan (willingly or due to the things he can't control) the banks write-off (called provisioning; could be partial or full) that in their P&L and Balance Sheet to show the true reflection of their own health (Rajan is pushing for aggressive approach, as you mention later in the post). That does not mean that the borrower walks away. The Banks continue to make efforts to recover the money (through notices, public-shaming, selling assets of borrower, change of management, restructuring, conversion into equity, court-cases, sale of loan to ARCs etc). If a loan (or part of that) has been written off by the bank, and the bank manages to recover it, the amount is written back and becomes a profit for that year. 

An interesting example here would be the business cycle of mid 90s-early 2000s. At that time also the banks faced huge defaults and were actually in a worse shape than today. But fortunately the global commodity prices shot through the roof and most of the bank clients turned around and Banks averted a disaster. Most borrowers were commodity companies at that time (steel, cement etc). 

This time this is not likely to happen. So the mess wouldn't clear itself up. 

> They could have taken measure to make sure the banks are being prudent when handing out money,

Not only did they not take these measures they actually forced the Banks to lend to their *favored* borrowers. one of the biggest defaulter is Unitech, which people say is a Gandhi-family company (rumor; don't ask for source). JP group another big defaulter was close to BSP, Jindals to Congress, HCC to Pawar, DLF to Huda/Vadra and so on. 

> They will benefit immensely from this loan write-off and bailouts.

If the government/banks play by the book (which is a big ask) they need not. Seize their fucking assets. If they have given a personal guarantee, seize their homes too. 

> So what happens next?

Short term- Government puts equity into the banks and they somehow survive

Medium term- Hopefully this Government puts professional management into the top layers of the bank (Board and CMD) and the rot is contained. It is happening in Bank Of Baroda but again a tall ask

Long term- The relative size of the PSU bank will shrink, pvt banks will become bigger. 

One last point. Why are politicians reluctant in reforming or privatizing the Banks? Because that is the biggest tool of granting favors to corporates who in turn are the biggest political donors. 

The last last point. There is a Silver lining, The bank's problem is a stock-problem i.e. the loans already given are going bad and we need to deal with it. What the system does not have, fortunately, is the 'flow' problem ie new money is coming into the system and if the investment cycle picks up, we will have the money to fund it.  Relevant Documentary: **[Overdose: The Next Financial Crisis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ECi6WJpbzE)** It is really appreciated that we have people like you who are willing to be frank about such situations. >Kingfisher Airlines borrowed an amount of Rs 7000 crore from 17 banks. These loans were declared as NPA and **the recoverable amount has come to a mere Rs 6 crore.** Go figure how much will be recovered from the 4.4 lakh crore.

The reason why this happened is because Mallaya used the trademarks and labels of kingfisher as collateral with the banks. But the value of these trademarks crashed when kingfisher went bankrupt. Now this goes without saying that a brand name would lose its value if it goes bankrupt, so why did banks took the risk of taking kingfisher trademarks as collateral in the first place when the loan was being taken for the vary same corporation.


>The bench headed by Chief Justice asked,

>It is all there in this Indian Express report.

Well, that's strange!

Is supreme court bench drawing its conclusions from a newspaper's report?
 I always post this lecture/article by Rajan on the topic of attitude of borrowers towards the bank. www.outlookindia.com/article/we-need-a-change-in-mind-set/292696

> The average interest rate on loans to the power sector today is 13.7% even while the policy rate is 8%. The difference, also known as the credit risk premium, of 5.7% is largely compensation banks demand for the risk of default and non-payment. Since the unscrupulous promoter hides among the scrupulous ones, every businessperson is tainted by the bad eggs in the basket. Even comparing the rate on the power sector loan with the average rate available on the home loan of 10.7%, it is obvious that even good power sector firms are paying much more than the average household because of bank worries about whether they will recover loans. Reforms that lower this 300 basis point risk premium of power sector loans vis-a-vis home loans would have large beneficial effects on the cost of finance, perhaps as much or more than any monetary policy accommodation.

Also highlights general problems like regulatory forbearance which was put in place for temporary use but has been abused again and again. - www.livemint.com/Opinion/RbcTUBqQfY7MOqW4uyTQ7H/Why-regulatory-forbearance-must-end.html

Recovery rates of PSBs are lower than Private sector banks but the latter's isn't all that higher either (25%), we need better bankruptcy laws to deal with this. 

cc /u/kumbhakaran you may want to add these links if you find them useful/insightful. >Through some clever book keeping and financial witchcraft, the managers have been sitting on this pile of rotting loans. They didn't have any reason to tell the higher ups about the terrible situation they were in. Until Rajan sent them that notice and forced them to declare these bad loans

It is not possible for the manger to hide bad loans as periodical review of all the accounts is done. 

Many of the bad loans have till now been prevented from being classified as NPAs by refinancing them with short term loans to avoid defaults. The RBI has now asked them to classify even such loans as bad loans. Also under consortium lending even if one member bank recognizes an account as NPA, all the banks are now required to treat the account as NPA which was not the case earlier. Both of these are major causes for the higher NPA numbers

It is the top management which is responsible for the current mess and not just the front end manager who in most of the cases is just following orders from the top. two very improtant numbers are missing 

1)  when you say 4.4 lakh cores in Non Performing Assets (NPAs)...what is the total out standing loan amounts outstanding for all banks concerned...only then can we say what percentage of total loans are NPA's....i can see that 4.4 lakh cores seems like lot but it will not make any sense until we see what how much of the total loaned out amount are NPA's.....

2) also what are the total deposits help for all bank concerned?.......

when these two numbers are understood then this issue wont be as dire as it seems....

all banks world over has NPA's...its the nature if the business..as long as the overall loans are managed well then we will be okay Can some one shed some light of why lots of big corporations defaulting? Indian economy is doing very good. Some companies are doomed to fail,  but in good economic situation there should be more successful than failed ones.  Umm sir why should government cover for the banks? How about a radical idea: Get government out of banking, let the public banks fail if they have to.

Modi promised divestment and reducing the size of the government. Government acquiring the bad loans of banks is completely opposite. Hope he sticks to his principles and stated promises. Anyone know about this?

Big corporate companies & PSU's take loan from foreign banks based outside of India, because they have near-zero interest rates. It's basically called External Commercial Borrowings (ECB)

Does the issue of NPA's exist in ECB too?  If possible, have Mr Satpathy ask a question in the question hour to Mr. Finance Minister about how the government plans to deal with these NPAs and where that money will come out of. This is what Make in India initiative will be twisted for. Just pledging an investment for so and so money. 

Whether they have expertise in that field or they are company which is not running in losses or a company with a history of bad loans or whether they will actually follow thorough, won't be observed at all. 

They will strong arm the banks to provide loans which they will use for their own company purposes. 

Check who are the highest defaulters currently are: Essar, Reliance, Adani, Vedanta, GVK. 

You think they will pay it off? Not a chance, they will use make in India as leverage, investment as a collateral, and continue bleeding ~~banks~~ PSBs.  You are welcome
http://www.moneyreformsindia.org/ Excellent write up /u/kumbhakaran with great inputs from /u/ribiy, I highly appreciate these kind of informative posts. Great read boss. A very fine write up.

A majority of those loans are actually the **'infrastructure loans'** that the corporates(majority of them private ones) took, mostly from the PSBs and then because of one reason or another(land acquisition, environmental clearances, etc.) weren't able to earn enough and in time to pay back.

Now, as the interest that they are supposed to pay, changes(increases, usually) every year(*notwithstanding the fact that the corporates usually factor in the interest risk factor during the initial years of the start of the project but because such projects provide returns for some 30-40 years on an average - like tollbooths on the highways - its usually a risk that pays off eventually*), if the project is stalled, the interest starts piling up. Inflation and falling rupee worsen the impact. 

I read today - [304 plans worth Rs 12,75,877 crore stuck; stalled projects continue to haunt policymakers](http://indianexpress.com/article/business/business-others/304-plans-worth-rs-1275877-cr-stuck-stalled-projects-continue-to-haunt-policymakers/)

There are a few measures that the current government did take last year, both on the revenue and the expense sides. One I remember is [Indradhanush](http://currentaffairs.gktoday.in/union-government-unveils-indradhanush-mission-psbs-08201525782.html) which aims to introduce a bit of corporatism in the management(and consequentially affecting the processes of verification of claims, disbursement of funds and monitoring of paybacks) of the Public Sector Banks of the country which were behaving like they were throwing a *langar* in a gurudwara. 

An impending [Bankruptcy Law](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/market-outlook/india-staring-at-banking-crisis-bankruptcy-law-crucial-sanger_5410401.html) and [Debt Restructuring measures](http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/c-p-chandrasekhar/saving-indias-public-sector-banks/article7392418.ece) might also help better the dire situation. Banks are not in trouble, our savings are in trouble.  > they have to clean up the mess

Modi can privatize the banks but the truth nobody has the balls to do it. Well now the fall in oil is a blessing in disguise for India. We don't have to print money to bail these banks out. Instead the govt is keeping the petrol prices high in part to pay for the subsidies provided when oil was upwards of $100/barrel and partly for the economic mess UPA1&2 left behind That's a very intelligent writing, but surprised to link Kingfisher Airline loss to Vijay Mallya. If he did some thing illegal like diverting funds from Kingfisher airlines to his personal accounts those kinds of activities are illegal and banks should go after his personal money. As a corporation setup he might have invested some of his money in it and some other individual's or corporation who got shares of the corporation.  Banks gave loan to that corporation betting on that success so banks could get portion of that success too. Some of those investmen's bound to fail just like any other investment and that's the risk they are taking. Banks are supposed to do honest evaluation of business model and management when they gave loan. 
 Shouldn't they consider more revenue from income tax and also implement drastic measures like cash transaction tax ( http://m.ndtv.com/profit/government-to-not-implement-banking-transaction-tax-712227) to bring more money into system ? What's the chance of my education loan being rejected?  OP, do you have information about a sector breakup of these NPA? If the exact names of the big defaulters are not known, is the statistics known?

I will also be interested in knowing how much of this NPA was loaned to GOI agencies like Air India. 

Edit: Thanks for the writeup. It's lucid. I know this first hand. One of my friends in SBI , a credit analyst objected to a big loan to a very poorly managed company.
But,eventually he got bullied by the sales teams and had to approve.
I remember that he got a silver ganesha worth at least 25k..the bank head got a golden ganesha as ""thank you gift""
The system is f***ed for good Good ELI5, but a few bad points.

1. Raghu is just as much to be blamed as the doctor that is operating on you now that you drunk so much that you crashed your bike on the street.

2. Manmohan and UPA are the biggest culprits since they forced the banks to give loans to corporate entities that were close to them (and likely Sonia and co were in on the take)

3. Supreme Court - When they do get a chance to pull the biggies down (looking at you, Sonia and Rahul in case of national Herald, or PC in case of Vasan Eyecare) - they pull the last punches, and thus feeding the ""too big to fail"" mindset.

4. Modi - Under Modi's term, the incremental borrowing has practically shrunk. They have no legislative control on the banks, as the banks report into the RBI from a regulatory standpoint. Bank appointees coming from Fin Secy is the only tangential link. Could Modi merge and privatize all these banks? Sure, that is something that I hope they do!

5. Big corporates - They are not to be blamed. They are sucking the system dry since they are being allowed to. Can you blame a tiger for eating up your dog? If you cannot keep your dog on the leash and a big gun nearby - it is not tiger's fault, it is its nature. Crooks will try to steal money. Bailouts and capital infusement are not the same.

The former involves the Treasury buying loans from banks with cash (that they inturn got from taxes or borrowing through bonds)

The latter involves the govt investing in the banks that it owns to acquire more assets. Nothing about loans.

So, this alone makes rest of the argument invalid.  >To put it simply: The taxpayer gets f'ed in the a. As always.

I disagree. The [ARCs](http://www.indiafilings.com/learn/asset-reconstruction-company-arc-india/) take up most of the NPAs and make a profit (management fee!) on recovering bad loans (vasooli) ! Thanks for the post, man.  Most of these bad loans are secured loans meaning there's a property or company assets that are mortgaged. Right now it is a pain in the ass for banks to recover NPA loans through the SARFAESI act. I hope the rules are simplified so that willing defaulters can face the consequences they deserve.  Why can't loan defaulters be forced to declare bankruptcy and the bank then can pay off their creditors using the defaulter's assets? Bailing out is not an option because then the banks would continue to give out bad loans. One of the big reason for this is very high interest rates (15-18%) in our country. Business margins are shrinking. Most companies are finding it hard to repay interest on loan, forget the principal.

Bankruptcy laws in India are very complicated. Actually they don't exist in the form they exist in Western countries. I have heard of so many stories of businessmen taking huge loans from banks and then fixing the system to never repay it or only a partial amount. The entire machinery works to make this system very efficient, including, politicians, bank employees, businessmen, accountants and middle men. Individuals do well while we collectively are screwed. relevant info  Reported this article to rbi at their contact us page. 

                          \__(^_^)__/  **Blame**

1. Raghuram Rajan - NO. He is only doing what should have been done long time back. If NPAs were allowed to go unchecked, most of them would have eaten up the system and even more bailout money at a later date. As of now we are already in a global recession/slow growth, so this is the right time to absorb the losses rather than carrying it forward and having it crash a bull market.

2. UPA - YES. They made hay with jobless inflationary growth while pocketing huge sums between themselves. Too bad there's no political accountability, the least we should do is pressure them to stop putting obstructions in the reform process. I'm looking at you /u/tathagatasatpathy /u/kumbhakaran 

3. NDA-II - NO. Capital infusion to PSBs is required to offset the shitstorm. See the BoB 12 Feb jump in share price: http://www.google.com/finance?q=NSE:BANKBARODA. this was because they declared huge amounts of NPA. Now this is one bank which won't need any bailout in the near future. All banks must come clean with as much NPA as they can clean up. This, combined with the Bankrupty Bill, will allow quick cleanup, larger than usual recovery in cases where assets are still there, and we can move on with a clean conscience.

4. Banks. YES/NO - while the systems there are still alright, banks need to get rid of front desks which give loans for bribes. This should be a simple task. Look at the list of approving officers. Finds officers whose sanctions have disproportionately gone in the red, fire them, put cases against them and let I-T handle the rest.

5. Big Corporations - YES. Same as the officers above: find chronic defaulters, black list them, file cases against them as appropriate, and let appropriate authorities handle the rest.

6. *Common Man* - YES. There was a post yesterday asking for ideas on how the common man can help India grow. *Don't give or take bribes.* As simple as that.

I bring you the second edition of Last Week in the Indian Parliament! I got a lot of feedback last time and people insisted I keep it more narrative based. I shall do so but I have also included briefs from PRS in the end for the legislative business transacted during the week. 

Boy do I have stories for you today!

Last week, a Rajya Sabha member was suspended for a day for making ‚Äòunauthorised inane noise‚Äô; a controversial amendment was passed which allows foreign funding for political parties; the government of the day tactfully avoided being embarrassed by a new ‚ÄòJumla‚Äô; and Big Tobacco fought the Government with Zero Hour Notices.

Let‚Äôs get right into it!

#Money Bill strikes again!
___
The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a troubled lot. They have an easy majority in Lok Sabha, which allows them to push their bills through, but they don‚Äôt have the numbers in Rajya Sabha to do the same. For the past two years, the opposition in the upper house has blocked their legislative agenda through the creative use of their throats and by camping all around the speaker‚Äôs grand throne-chair, protesting away to glory. But the Government of the day seems to have a few tricks up its sleeve. They seem to be aiming to completely ignore the upper house by using the [Money Bill route](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/492acw/lets_talk_about_the_new_aadhaar_bill_it_can/). Twice!


The first instance of ‚ÄòOperation Money Bill‚Äô was observed on March 11, when the Lok Sabha passed the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Bill, 2016. During the consideration of this bill, many members screamed bloody murder and opposed this legislation being certified as a Money Bill. It went to the Rajya Sabha for recommendations. The bill got passed, 4 days later, on March 16 in its original form. The government of the day seems to have hit Parliament procedure gold. So merely two months later, they decided to do it again.

And this time, it was to bring in FDI in politics!

The Finance Bill 2016 was passed in the Lok Sabha with a clause that did not belong in that legislation, namely, amendments the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act, 2010 (FCRA).

#BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players
___

The FCRA Amendment is a strange one. Earlier foreign companies were not allowed to make donations to political parties. For obvious reasons. Otherwise entities like Monsanto [would have a field day](http://imgur.com/AsZqfLk). 

The logic being that foreign entities should not be able to influence our Parliament to make laws that favor them. In 2014, both BJP and Congress were found guilty by the Delhi High Court of accepting foreign contributions from UK based company Vedanta. So the government of the day decided to deal with it by making a retrospective amendment to the FCRA act by hiding it within the Finance Bill.

This amendment has cleared Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha has no say in it (because, you know, ‚ÄòOperation Money Bill‚Äô) and the President‚Äôs approval will come soon. Say hello to FDI in Politics.

#The Curious Case of Finance Bill, 2016
___
During the debate on the Finance Bill on Wednesday, Asaduddin Owaisi raised a point of order to question the government on the validity of the FCRA amendment. He argued that this act comes under the Home Ministry and amending it through a Finance Bill goes against the provisions of the Constitution. He demanded that the discussion should be suspended immediately since the bill is flawed. 

The decision landed on the lap of deputy speaker of Lok Sabha Arjun Charan Singh, who looked like a dog-lover with a cat in his lap. Unsure what to do. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley was away on an official visit to Germany so MoS Jayant Sinha tried to do a [ninja save](http://imgur.com/G9lMcPM). He told Owaisi that Jaitley will respond to his query while replying to the debate.

**[24 hours later](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/spongebob/images/e/e8/24_Hours_Later..._.png/revision/latest?cb=20130519222728)**

While giving his reply speech, the Fin Min sort of ignored the FCRA issue. Instead, he spoke about giving funds to the Polavaram Dam. It upset Biju Janata Dal from Orissa enough to stage a rather noisy walkout. The debate ended abruptly and clause by clause on the Finance Bill began. 

Still no word about the point of order despite Owaisi asking the speaker for a ruling.

[Cricket sounds #1](http://imgur.com/DKiZ6Mw)

The Finance Minister had made 49 official amendments to the Finance Bill, so the speaker was going through them one by one. Clause 233, which concerns the controversial FCRA amendment, was clubbed in with Clauses 220 to 230, schedules first to fifteen and passed together.

[Cricket sounds #2](http://imgur.com/wn6P3Mv)

After the clause by clause consideration was completed, the speaker gave a ruling to Owaisi‚Äôs point of order and denied it. Ignoring protests from some members, she called for the passage of the bill.

[Cricket sounds #3](http://imgur.com/JxBvCE6)

Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha. 

The Finance Minister be like [#EpicWin](http://img.memecdn.com/epic-win_o_834502.gif).

#The ‚ÄòJumla‚Äô that escaped
___
Leader of Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad raised the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) issue in Rajya Sabha. Jairam Ramesh has written about this extensively in The Hindu ( [Part 1](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/jairam-ramesh-on-the-krishna-godavari-basin-scam/article8486493.ece) & [Part 2](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/comment-article-by-jairam-ramesh-on-the-kg-basin-scam-part-ii/article8533360.ece) ). 
To give you a short rundown of this ‚ÄòJumla‚Äô, in 2005 GSPC claimed that the KG Basin had an epic deposit of natural gas worth an estimated Rs. 2,20,000 crore. They spent Rs 19,700 crore over a period of a decade for ‚Äògas exploration‚Äô but did not get even a tiny whiff of the sweet sweet hydrocarbon gas mixture. Five CAG reports over the past five years have pointed out discrepancies in the way GSPC operated. The Congress has been dying to dig deep into this issue and they finally did it in Rajya Sabha. They took out their shovels, ready to break the earth while singing merry songs of victory.

But then, they struck a rock called Arun Jaitley even before they started digging.

Jaitley told Azad that this issue cannot be raised in Parliament because the [Public Accounts Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Accounts_Committee_(India) (PAC) is already examining it. The PAC is a committee of selected members of Parliament, constituted by the Parliament of India, for the auditing of the revenue and the expenditure of the Government of India. The house cannot deliberate on matters that a Parliamentary committee is already deliberating.

#Rule 255: Kick the disrupter
___
Rajya Sabha was yet again disrupted at the beginning of the week over the Agusta Westland issue. Members trooped into the well, shouting garbled slogans against the Government. Then, Rule 255 happened. 

> ‚ÄúThe Chairman may direct any member whose conduct is in his opinion grossly disorderly to withdraw immediately from the Council and any member so ordered to withdraw shall do so forthwith and shall absent himself during the remainder of the day's meeting.‚Äù [Source](http://rajyasabha.nic.in/rsnew/rs_rule/generalrulesproc.asp)

Hamid Ansari, Chairman of Rajya Sabha invoked this rule and ordered Sukhendu Roy of the TMC to be removed from the upper house for a day. Roy was seen standing at his seat and demanding (very loudly) to know who benefitted from the Agusta Westland scam. 

Here‚Äôs an excerpt from the debate:

[""Please stop making inane noise""](http://imgur.com/JQhbrjq)

[""Please stop talking... or else""](http://imgur.com/vl0UVaB)

[""RULE 255 BITCHES!!! GTFO!""](http://imgur.com/v3kMrpA)

After the Sukhendu Roy left, taking his ‚Äòunauthorized inane noise‚Äô with him, the Congress continued its valiant attempt to stall the proceedings in the house. Nitin Gadkari, visibly upset, requested Ansari to smite them with his awesome legal powers and invoke 255 on all of them. Ansari pointed out that Rule 255 applies only to individual members and cannot be enforced en masse.

#Big Tobacco vs Unhealthy Lung pictures
___
There have been three zero hour notices raised in the Lok Sabha this session regarding increasing health warnings on tobacco products to 85%. To give you some context, the government had passed an order in 2014 which mandated tobacco manufacturers to show gruesome pictures of decaying lungs that cover up to 85% of the product packet. 

The pictures would dissuade new smokers from taking up the deadly cause and it has been proven to be quite effective in many countries around the world. This order was to come into force on April 1 this year and there has been a battle raging between the Tobacco industry and the government on the sidelines. /u/dextermilburn has been talking about ITC shutting down and opening factories [in his posts](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4inj30/last_week_in_indian_economy_for_the_week_ending/) for a few weeks now. The Parliament also became a stage where this battle is being fought by filing notices in favor and against the government‚Äôs move.

Last week on May 3rd, Baijayant Panda raised a zero hour notice supporting the government‚Äôs move to increase the warning size. He urged the government to hold its ground on increasing health warnings and to implement its order diligently. 

On 27th April, two other members had raised a notice to oppose the government‚Äôs move, namely R Dhruvanarayana and Sharadkumar Bansode. Both of these members spoke about how tobacco farmers and beedi manufacturers will be adversely affected if these warnings are imposed. They wanted the government to consider the plight of the farmers connected to the industry and not impose the order.

Last Wednesday, the Supreme Court had a hearing where upheld the Government‚Äôs 2014 order and asked Tobacco companies to implement it.

**What is a Zero Hour and why is it important?**

‚ÄòZero Hour‚Äô refers to a time period in the Parliament when members can raise matters of urgent public importance to bring it to the notice of the government of the day. Every day when the Parliament is in session, there is one hour allotted to raise such notices. A member is required to file the notice in Parliament before 9 a.m. on the same day. A ballot takes place in which notices are randomly selected and are allowed to be raised. In Lok Sabha, the Zero hour usually happens from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. and in Rajya Sabha, it happens from 11 a.m. to 12 p.m. It‚Äôs upto the speakers in both houses to decide the time slot of the zero hour, depending on how heavy the legislative business is.

The Zero hour is easily one of the most ignored aspect of our Parliamentary process. It a perfect way to judge what is on the minds of our elected representatives. For instance, in the past two weeks numerous notices were raised on the water crisis and drought situation in the country. Considering that these notices are randomly selected through a ballot, the sheer volume points towards the fact that this crisis is bigger and badder than we imagine.

[Last Week's post.](https://np.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4h3ioz/last_week_in_the_indian_parliament_april_25_april/)


EDIT: Tiny grammar edits and added last week's post.

EDIT2: Thank you for the gold (x2) kind strangers! It makes me really happy to see that so many people are interested in content of this nature. :)",kumbhakaran," This is brilliant. Has there been any media coverage at all about FDI in politics? This could change the way crony capitalism in this country works.  >BJP & Congress: Secretive Team Players

>Not a single word about the FCRA amendment was spoken that day. Just like that, a super important law that will change how our political parties are funded, was accepted by the Lok Sabha.

Proof if any needed, that BJP & Congress are no different from each other! They'll join hands and throw out democracy if it benefited them.

>The ‚ÄòJumla‚Äô that escaped

Not just a 'jumla' but the likes of 'scam' that this very BJP govt chased Congress out of power!

In 2005, then CM Modi abruptly announced that the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation (GSPC) had discovered 20 trillion cubic feet of gas in KG basin (that the BJP promptly renamed the Deendayal West area block), which would generate revenue worth Rs. 2.2 lakh crore for India! Everyone (including the state and central administrations as well as subject experts) was astonished at this fantastic claim. 

If true, such a find would have made India energy self-sufficient, a must for any country aspiring for super power status. Modi‚Äôs announcement therefore generated euphoric excitement and even shifted the narrative from him being the alleged mastermind of the 2002 riots to a potential Prime Ministerial candidate. 

In fact, given how events unfolded, it is abundantly clear that the announcement (like everything else PM Modi does) was just another exaggerated publicity stunt.

 Modiji pays heed exclusively to his own mann ki baat! He thus ignored the field report, and forced GSPC to go ahead with the project. Because of this, GSPC borrowed nearly Rs 20,000 crore from 15 different public and private sector banks. And what does India have in return? Nothing! 

But the issue is not just about Modiji‚Äôs gaseous exaggerations. It is also about diversion of public funds and corruption. After coercing GSPC to go ahead with drilling in KG basin, CM Modi forced it to partner with a company named Geo Global. Now here‚Äôs the interesting bit:

*Geo Global  was reportedly incorporated just six days before the agreement with GSPC. At the time of entering into the agreement with GSPC, Geo Global‚Äôs capital was reportedly a measly Rs 3,200. A week after the agreement, its capital mushroomed to Rs 10,000 crore.*

>In its report for the year ended March 31, 2015, tabled in state assembly this year, CAG had pulled up GSPC for its lack of experience as 'overseas operator'. ""The delay in execution of the work committed resulted in cost escalations in overseas blocks. As a result, the company had incurred expenditure of Rs 1,757.46 crore for 10 surrendered blocks, of which Rs 1,734.12 crore has been written off,"" the apex auditor noted.

Was this public money diverted to fund Modi ji‚Äôs extravagant 2014 election campaign? Does this not merit an independent high level judicial probe? And even more interestingly, when the screws were tightened on Vijay Mallya for defaulting on Rs. 9000 crore, why is GSPC not being subject to similar treatment? Why is it that instead, its Managing Director was rewarded with an appointment as the [Director of the National Informatics Centre?](http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-18/news/63568239_1_gujarat-state-petroleum-corporation-deity-gspc)

However, desperately the BJP may sycophantically defend PM Modi, the bitter reality is that under him corruption was rampant in Gujarat. Consider how [he gave 250 acres of land (in a restricted wildlife zone) to cronies of the current CM of Gujarat for less than Rs. 1.5 crore.](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/anandiben-patels-daughter-in-soup-over-gir-sanctuary-land-deal-congress-wants-sit-probe/1/588670.html)

Similarly, [CM Modi gave public land for the Mundra SEZ.](http://www.frontline.in/cover-story/the-great-land-grab/article4666181.ece), which was worth Rs. 1500 per square metre for a pittance (anything between Rs. 01 & Rs. 32) That is why for years, the CAG was deliberately denied access to numerous files in Gujarat. And that is also why under Modi ji, a Lokayukta was not appointed for 10 years.

In his avatar as Prime Ministerial candidate, Modi ji had famously argued ‚Äúmain na khata hoon, na khaane deta hoon‚Äù. It seems the truth is different.

19,700 crore you mean right? 

Also, nice work! :) Hey, this is very interesting. Please keep it up, thank you! Firstly, great job man. This is the real shit. I'm so angry about FDI in politics, and other issues I wouldn't really have cared to watch Rajya Sabha TV/Lok Sabha TV for.

I wanted to ask- what is the law regarding corporations donating to campaigns of political parties in India? Are corporations considered as people and granted the same rights of free speech? (free speech = throw money where you want, that's the logic in US Supreme Courts' Citizen United anyways) thank you sir, for your valuable service.

I really look forward to next week.

Randia needs this. Dude that was an amazing read! Thanks a lot for this summary. Many people do not understand legislative business and do not have awareness of public policy affairs. We think that job of an MP is to take appointments of ministers, get funds by hook or nook , attend the projects opening ceremonies and take some commissions on the way.If someone comes in their way, get them transferred.

I work with Loksatta party (Dr Jayaprakash Narayan) and feel very bad sometimes knowing the apathy of fellow citizens towards public policy and legislative process.

Business/Finance,I am forwarding an interesting story about world economy. How valid is it? I leave it to you. Another whatsapp forward,9,7jrv4g,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7jrv4g/i_am_forwarding_an_interesting_story_about_world/,8,"Amazing logic indeed. This is a crazy world! Interesting article written by an Indian Economist

Japanese save a lot. They do not spend much. Also, Japan exports far more than it imports. Has an annual trade surplus of over 100 billion. Yet Japanese economy is considered weak, even collapsing.

Americans spend, save little. Also US imports more than it exports.
Has an annual trade deficit of over $400 billion. Yet, the American economy is considered strong and trusted to get stronger.

But where from do Americans get money to spend? They borrow from Japan, China and even India.
Virtually others save for the US to spend. Global savings are mostly invested in US, in dollars.

India itself keeps its foreign currency assets of over $50 billion in US securities. China has sunk over $160 billion in US securities.
Japan's stakes in US securities is in trillions.

Result:
The US has taken over $5 trillion from the world. So, as the world
saves for the US - It's The Americans who spend freely. Today, to keep the US consumption going, that is for the US economy to work, other
countries have to remit $180 billion every quarter, which is $2
billion a day, to the US!

A Chinese economist asked a neat question. Who has invested more, US in China, or China in US? The US has invested in China less than half of what China has invested in US.

The same is the case with India. It have invested in US over $50
billion. But the US has invested less than $20 billion in India.

Why the world is after US?

The secret lies in the American spending, that they hardly save. In fact they use their credit cards to spend their future income. That the US spends is what makes it attractive to export to the US. So US imports more than what it exports year after year.

The result:

The world is dependent on US consumption for its growth. By its deepening culture of consumption, the US has habituated the world to
feed on US consumption. But as the US needs money to finance its consumption, the world provides the money.

It's like a shopkeeper providing the money to a customer so that the customer keeps buying from the shop. If the customer will not buy, the shop won't have business, unless the shopkeeper funds him. The US is like the lucky customer. And the world is like the helpless shopkeeper
financier.

Who is America's biggest shopkeeper financier? Japan of course. Yet it's Japan which is regarded as weak. Modern economists complain that
Japanese do not spend, so they do not grow. To force the Japanese to spend, the Japanese government exerted itself, reduced the savings
rates, even charged the savers. Even then the Japanese did not spend (habits don't change, even with taxes, do they?). Their traditional postal savings alone is over $1.2 trillion. Thus, savings, far from being the strength of Japan, has become its pain.

Hence, what is the lesson?

That is, a nation cannot grow unless the people spend, not save. Not just spend, but borrow and spend.
Dr. Jagdish Bhagwati, the famous Indian-born economist in the US, told Manmohan Singh that Indians wastefully save. Ask them to spend, on imported cars and, seriously, even on cosmetics! This will put India on a growth curve. This is one of the reason for MNC's coming down to India, seeing the consumer spending.

'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue.'
But before you follow this Neo Economics, get some fools to save so that you can borrow from them and spend !!!
The world is in a economical mess üòÖ- interesting read",yasar434," But when Americans spend money in America, the money stays in America. But if you will spend money in India, most of this money will go out of India.
Example: Buy a IPhone product in America and India.  I get a feel this is snake oil logic. 

People need money to spend. Here currency is inr, so exporters would get paid in inr, and hence the Q may be to ask why is dollar so much more valuable and also why do Americans have so much more of it ? 

I have personally thought over what creates value at the very core and the answer always seems to me to be creation of new intellectual property in which US is the leader and will be for more time to come. 

As to why Americans have so much of it? I think it might be a very complicated Q and part of answer might be that they print it and also that lot of countries want to save in dollars and also invest in infrastructure creation in America... 
 This is not true on so many levels - the most obvious being that the spending habits of a nations's people has a very weak relationship (and even an inverse relationship sometimes) with the national debt. This is literally why macroeconomic indicators and microeconomic indicators should not be lumped or confused. Japan as a country is one of the most indebted nations with a debt to GDP ratio of 240%, while US is at about 106%. But it is just an indicator. If a government is borrowing mostly from its citizens in the form of government bonds (like the US) its not a big deal. If a government is borrowing to finance projects which will lead to economic growth, it can pay off those debts and have surplus left over in the future so its not a problem. For example, Greece's peak debt to GDP ratio of 160% was a huge concern because the economy was not growing, while the Japanese economy has strong fundamentals so they can keep borrowing.

Also if you look at it from the other side, China basically needs new jobs every year to feed its people. It is an export driven economy that pays for these jobs by selling the massive amount US dollars it gets from these exports for RMB (Yuan) that it then gives to its people. But this increases the supply for US dollars which left unchecked would overvalue the RMB and China would then lose its competitive edge in the manufacturing market. So to always keep the Yuan slightly undervalued it buys enough long-term US government bonds. These bonds also act as low risk investments that keep its portfolio diversified against the high risk manufacturing projects that it takes on in Africa for example.

So platitudes like 'Saving is sin, and spending is virtue' might sound reasonable and be applicable at a microeconomic level, but does not work at all when you are talking about countries. 'Keep your investment portfolio diversified' is a better saying that applies to virtually all levels of consumers. Hmm I don't know why people in the thread are thinking this is some mind blowing non mainstream line of thought.

OP can be easily explained as a version of Keynesian economics and demand side economics. Put money in the pockets of workers and the economy will grow because they spend more than they save. 

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/keynesianeconomics.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040915/what-demandside-economics.asp Looks like another attempt at emotional blackmailing Indians to give up their gold and other savings for a better ‚Äúfuture‚Äù  The reason why everyone ""invests"" in Dollars is because that is the currency for oil trade.

Unless you have a specific agreement like India and Iran, the default currency to buy crude oil is USD.

So everytime, every country wants to buy oil, it has to buy USD from the market and then pay the oil supplier. This keeps the USD strong compared to other currencies.

Also, the reason Americans consume so much is because they don't have strict import laws to ""protect"" the local industries like we do. The buyers in the US are free to choose what quality of products they want to use. And usually it's an imported products that is priced better than a local brand.

If we (India) remove import duty, we fear that Tata and Mahindra will die out. While the US takes it as a challenge and makes newer Chevys and Fords and, ahem, Chryslers.

Just like the Taliban doesn't represent Muslims. Anyone can eat what they want. Honestly I would stand with these guys and tell those wound ups to fuck right off Objection on beef in Germany? Motherfuckers, this is the land of beef and pork. Fuckers, go back to India. Why the fuck are you even in Germany? Go back inside Modi's arse and eat dhokla. I suppose they were serving Porota Beef.
No one comes in between a Malayali and his porota beef. Objecting beef in Germany? Lol, these guys are unbelievable. If you can't tolerate people with different eating habits, maybe you shouldn't be living in places where people have different eating habits than you. Just stay home back in India if you're so close minded. This is is stupid , if you dont wanna eat then dont eat the beef , why restricting others bc puri duniya k samne ijaat ka kachra kar rahe hai ye narrow minded bhadwe. How much common sense can anyone lack to understand food pyramid, human history and HUMANITY. Keep crying bitch supreme leader modi doesn't have jurisdiction in Germany Well the Malayalis should have boycotted the event. Fuck these RW nuts. Peace Why such compulsion?? If you don‚Äôt like beef don‚Äôt eat it! Let others enjoy! üòë Aise log India ko har jagah badnaam krte hai. Germany jaakr bhi berozgaar ho to isse acha vapis aa jao. These assholes can't leave people in peace anywhere in god damn world. Don't go and settle in beef eating countries. Oh that would be India, the country you left in the first place. Now sanghi pigs have started spreading their cancer abroad. Idiots protesting other idiots.

Its an ""Indian"" food fest. Not a ""Hindu"" food fest.  25% of Indians have no prohibition against beef and do eat beef.

What moronic times we live in. Just so you guys know it's part of Hindu Culture to eat beef. Sad day - CGI Germany bowed down to goons Maybe they should come right back. Bitches These extremists don't decide what is Indian culture.  There are several states where beef is eaten.

""Kerala, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Tripura and West Bengal are the states where there are no restrictions on cow slaughter.""

Indian culture isn't based on what a majority does either. If that is the case then lynchings would also have to be considered as an Indian culture. 

In the case of beef Some Indians eat it some don't. So if you are a part of India you can't say that your country doesn't eat beef. If you want to say that then you aren't talking about India anymore.

It isn't against Indian culture to eat beef.

It isn't against Hinduism to eat beef either. Because there are many texts that show that beef was consumed by hindus for years. The most these extremists can say it is that their political parties and groups don't eat beef, ie bjp,rss,etc. Go mallus!‚ú®üòÇ > However, some right-wing Hindu organisations raised objections over the menu, saying that serving beef was a ""direct attack on Indian culture"" and **threatened to create a ruckus during the festival.**

Clear case of CGI Frankfurt getting bogged down by what can be called terrorists or atleast mafia Do these north Indians never visit a German resturant, or drive out Germans from other food fairs where I'm pretty sure some beef would be common?. Oh no. There they must integrate and be diverse. Yeah just when we have ou diverse culture on display, they want it shudh shakahari. Not in a non nazi regime my aryans. What are these idiots doing outside the country then?? Fuckers... Come back to your UP style Yogi-rajya if you want to follow your version of shuddh indian culture.

Fucktards. From what I know of cultural/food festivals, foreign embassies ask their expatriates to present the culture of their home country in the form of food, movies, books, drama, souvenirs to the natives. It is a way for the natives(Germans in this case), to experience the culture of other countries(India). 

Sanghis objected to Kerala stall serving beef as though Kerala culture cannot be presented to the Germans as Indian food. 

You can be sure that Sanghis would have also exercised control through their thug organisations to decide what movies and books would have been presented to the Germans.

It is important to understand this larger fight of control over what defines India, rather than look at this as just another instance of Sanghis preventing Keralites consuming beef. The event was called ""Indian Vegetarian Food Fest"". Here is the coverage from German national broadcaster: https://m.dw.com/hi/%E0%A4%9C%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%AD%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%AF-%E0%A4%96%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-%E0%A4%95%E0%A5%80-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%95/g-50275074

 Indian embassy organized that in remembrance of 150 years of Gandhi.

I don't understand why this protest when the event was openly called vegetarian food festival. Here's the reason why malayalis/Keralites whatever u prefer are protesting.  Ig as a Malayali I can speak for

FACTS :- 1)  NRI's in Germany are mostly Malayali's like most of the NRI's in Singapore are from Tamil Nadu and Punjabi's in Canada.

 2) Hindu/Christian/Muslim/Areligious  Malayali's eat beef in general in Kerala since it's one of the only States where beef (cow meat)  is legal. 

REASON :-  Quite simple they feel their preferences are being ignored coz Christian's eat all poultry meats, Hindu's don't eat beef, Muslims don't eat pork. You see where I am getting at? You can't satisfy everyone so it leads to conflict. 

Why is it happening now? Increase in population of Muslim/Christian NRI's in Germany. 

Can we enjoy diversity in peace? No coz diversity always leads to conflict no matter how optimistic you're. [deleted]",2019-09-03 06:14:06
Food,"In the Name of Hinduism, People are Boycotting Tea, Food, Fashion, Detergent and all Logic",139,czjgeb,https://theprint.in/features/in-the-name-of-hinduism-people-are-boycotting-tea-food-fashion-detergent-and-all-logic/285941/,67,,thewebdev," > As Ganesh Chaturthi fever gripped parts of the country over the weekend, a section of Hindus were also taking a break from the euphoria to lead a #BoycottRedLabel movement on Twitter ‚Äî the tea, not the alcohol.

> A seemingly innocuous advertisement of the beverage, released in September 2018, was retrieved from the archives of the world wide web to give parent company Hindustan Unilever (HUL) a hard time.

> The ad shows a Hindu man approaching a Ganpati idol-maker to take home a murti of Bappa for the first time. The elderly idol-maker offers parcels of knowledge about Hindu traditions and tales to his customer, leaving the man suitably impressed. But then, because it‚Äôs time for his namaaz, the idol-maker puts on a skull cap, revealing his Muslim identity. The Hindu buyer is surprised, feels betrayed and disappointed.

> *‚ÄúI have some work today, I‚Äôll come back tomorrow,‚Äù* he says, excusing himself from the interaction.

> The idol-maker asks him to at least stay for (Red Label) tea. Facilitated by a glass of chai, the Hindu man‚Äôs bigotry disappears when the Muslim man explains why he does what he does: *‚ÄúBhaijaan, yeh bhi toh ibadat hai‚Äù* (Brother, this is also worship).

> The last frame reads, *""Inspired by a true story.""* Boycott culture has officially entered India, but unfortunately, it won't work because most companies in India are monopolies, even the so called bhakts would find it difficult to find alternatives to these everyday things. Perhaps that is why Patanjali is present, but even then, it is sub par and so the Bhakts will silently revert to the quality products they used previously. I searched for the Red Label ad on YouTube and this was the first search result - https://youtu.be/l99pVT8MOXQ

I am speechless üò∂. Bhakti is really blind. No one actually follows this in real life outside of twitter.

People think twitter represents India and thats just so false. Why do people think that twitter is real India? People wanted to boycott surf excel but nothing happened. People wanted to boycott Zomato but nothing happened.

We Indians just suck at protests and boycotting. Extremists (Of every religion) are trash. And its sad to see that in this day and age, they have the louder voice in our country. I don't even know where our country is going anymore. 
""Secular"" is only used in political propaganda and the true meaning of it is already being forgotten. Why are religious people even allowed to sue others with the reason of 'X's words hurt my faith' thats stupid because as an atheist their words hurt my ideology when they force me to pray but can I sue them? No.
Despite having freedom of religion, we still are not free. [deleted] Reddit crowd is very different here. Almost every comment I read is about how this boycott culture is wrong. Criticising  the majority of the people who think this kind of ads are wrong.

 I think virtue signalling about religious differences in Ads and movies is not cool. They think they are helping society by doing this but it absolutely does not. It's a festival of Hindus and you are trying to tell them that they are the real villains on this day ? At this point you are just desperately seeking attention, knowing how the reaction is going to be like.

How can anyone justify this kind of ad. I genuinely want to know ?

Does everything has to bring the damn religions in the middle every damn time. It's like they think, they'll get attention only if they bring religion in the middle. Cadburi ads are good, they don't this shit. I don‚Äôt give a shit about religion but don‚Äôt you think showing hindus always as intolerant and showing muslims as good hearted kinda defeats the purpose of these videos?. Why not show muslims carry pork items       On swiggy to people and say that carrying food is also a type of worship?.",2019-09-05 00:47:34

Putting the names of the offending doctors and hospitals involved in the racket. xpost this is /r/worldnews and other subs.

Name and shame. Nestle is the most evil corporation ever. Whenever there is a thread on askreddit about evil companies Nestle is always on the top Sick I dont know why im surprised, fuck nestle How come no government is able to reign in nestle effectively? Maybe it‚Äôs too powerful as a company Nestle is a kind of a serial offender of a company. How the fuck do these fucking companies have the gall to do such shady stuff in India and not in US? First Johnson and Johnson and now Nestle. > Breaking the law, Nestle has conducted clinical trials on 75 premature babies in five hospitals on substitutes for breast milk in complete contravention of the Infant Milk Substitutes Act. It was found by Breastfeeding Promotion Network of India (BPNI) on screening the trial registry of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) that Nestle has sponsored a research titled ‚ÄúMulticentric Observational Study to Observe Growth in Preterm hospitalised infants‚Äù.

> The trial was conducted on 75 premature babies between the age of 28-34 weeks. The objective of the study was to assess the growth and feeding intolerance in preterm infants. One of the exclusions was that the infant could not be fed milk substitute within 48 hours of birth, but from the third day onwards, the trial suggested that the infant could be given a milk substitute instead of breast milk.

> ... *‚ÄúThey are conducting these trials on premature babies. It is extremely risky. Babies are most sensitive during this period. What would have happened if anything went wrong with these babies,‚Äù* asks Amulya Nidhi, co-convenor of Swasth Adhikar Manch.

* CEO:  Y-yes. Perfect. Premature babies. Mister Shkreli and Mister Beiber,  you're dismissed. Start rounding up a sample cohort of premature babies.  Cthulu and I will stay here and work out the details. These are the companies we need to boycott. Not Zomato or Snapdeal Boycott Nestle Hope they get fined to oblivion Cross post this to /r/hydrohomies 

They loathe Nestle and can possibly make this news viral. Why is Nestle suddenly violating laws in India? Is it looking to join BJP? Ok I guess some proper information needs to be given here. I am a medical Prof who has done fair share of research across international papers and so I can tell abt these studies and what is the ACTUAL problem.

1. First of all, clinical trials on premature babies are done all the time. Observational studies, randomized control trials are done occasionally and hence it is not 'BARBARIC'. These trials are done precisely to know whether the treatment options that we have are even worth it or not. 

The substitute for breast milk is actually necessary especially when mother is not lactating and you need to feed breast milk to baby. The suckling reflex hasn't developed in premature baby and hence they need to be given from outside. Sometimes breast milk is just not available or is inadequate and hence a substitute is absolutely necessary.

2. Ok now comes this study. First of all, any study of such type is always done after ethical clearance AND after consent from the parents. This is true for all subjects of any study. Most probably there is a case control study here where some premat babies are fed normal breast milk and some are fed with substitute milk. And then the growth is seen. After the result the subjects are always shifted back to standard therapy .

Again consent is always taken.

3. Now we say any Nestle. The thing which Nestle did was break the law which said THEY CANT GIVE MONETARY OR OTHER BENEFIT TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDER. Nestle is a company which is creating a new product. That is fine. They have to get it tested in clinical trials. That is completely fine as well. The researchers have to do it in respective hospitals with proper place for premat babies and a NICU etc etc. That is fine as well.

However giving benefits to the researcher involved for a skewed result? That is not ok. 

Starting research before official ethical clearence certificate? That is not ok.

Basically if the wordings of this article are correct, then the problem is that Nestle is most prob hiring researchers on their own terms and hence the study isn't exactly unbiased...

4. Is it harmful to babies? It depends really. If they are shifted back to current gold standard of treatment after results and everything else is ensured ( see their exclusion criteria is pretty good). Then it won't hurt them. However is the results are skewed when they are actually not useful then it can be harmful for further babies who receive them in subsequent trials. Hence why unbiased research is really important in clinical trials.

So everyone, hold your horses. It is not as unethical as you are thinking. They are not killing babies here nor are they doing something absolutely horrible. However it does become unethical when it is forming an unbiased research. That should be condemmned. 

Research is a wonderful thing and we should do it unbiased to help everyone involved. Nowhere is any mention of penalizing the company. Is there any provision of penalty or prosecution for the company involved. Man. Nestle is fucked up
And I thought I was being healthy by eating nestle products India is/becoming the guinea pig for experiments of the western world! Do the parents know that their infant is part of such trials? Does the doctor or anyone else inform them? Ugh There real question should be , what are we going to do about it? Congress mouthpiece is doing better journalism than many so-called neutral outlets like Republic.  I'm not even suprised tho! Nestle has a reputation of going to third world countries and doing shit like this. They are honestly, EVIL! How much evil shit can be leveraged over Maggi noodles Evil scum, its hard but I try my best to stay away from their products Don't they already have premature baby food? Pure evil! I kinda thought they would learn something after starving and infecting to death babies of perfectly healthy mothers. Nope, they were just waiting for another unsuspecting people. Is there a subreddit for the types of this post Unrelated to topics , What are substitute for Nestle cerelax , I have baby I am giving it as supplement food Looks like patanjali about to launch similar products.. just giving baba headstart.

In technologically backward prehistory, in Rousseau‚Äôs ‚Äústate of nature‚Äù (l‚Äô√©tat de nature), when men and women lived in forests and had never entered a shop or read a newspaper, the philosopher pictured people more easily understanding their own minds, and so being drawn towards essential features of a satisfied life: a love of family, a respect for nature, an awe at the beauty of the universe, a curiosity about others, and a taste for music and simple entertainments. The state of nature was also moral, guided by piti√©, (pity) for others and their suffering. It was from this state that modern commercial ‚Äòcivilisation‚Äô had pulled us, leaving us to envy and long for and suffer in a world of plenty. I called in sick today. I just didn't feel like going to work. Nutted thrice before noon. Made some chicken and ate like a pig. By evening, I got sad and depressed. I'm a single 31 y/o with acne issues, thinning hair and overweight. Somehow decided to take a walk in the late evening. Just got back and now I strongly feel the need to clean up my shit. I've decided to lose weight and try to be happy again. Happy teachers day to Time.

Happened today - 

I was in a lift, casually standing against back wall. The was a girl in front of me and she was talking to her friends and appeared clumsy. The lift stopped, more people came in and she had to move back towards wall to let others accomulate.  While in this process, as she was clumsy,  her hand touched my peepee. She was startled and moved her hand away. She looked towards her friends with embarrassment in her face. 

You know rest of the story...

Later virgins. I promise to God that I will shitpost on LRNDT everyday. What's the difference between self respect and ego?

I've got a friend who won't talk to his ex.

Food,"India‚Äôs Restaurants Rebel Against Food Delivery Apps: Frustrated by the steep commissions and discounts that apps like Zomato and Uber Eats push on restaurants, thousands have started a movement to #Logout from them.",96,cz4z2q,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/technology/india-restaurants-logout-delivery-zomato.html,19,,OrneryReflection," I don't want to go to a restaurant and wait for my food for 20 minutes. I'd rather wait for my food for 40 minutes at home. I'm a Zomato Gold user who was perplexed when a restaurant I frequent suddenly stopped accepting Zomato Gold. Although I sort of argued with them (mildly), once I did my research on it, I fully understand why restaurants would do this. 

In the long run, all this discounting will only hurt both restaurants and customers since restaurants need a margin to run on. They'll have to make up for it somehow and usually it's by increasing prices. 

Customers pay Zomato for Zomato Gold, restuarants pay Zomato to be a part of the Zomato Gold program (else they'll lose visibility -- that's how Zomato sells the whole thing), restaurants take the losses due to the discounts and on top of all this they even pay Zomato a commission per order. 

I just don't get what sort of value add Zomato does with its Gold program. (Sure, it has a nice review platform (so does Google) and it needs to make money somehow -- but this is stupid).

If Zomato Gold manages to capture more and more restaurants all that will happen is the price without the Gold program will increase. And we'll be paying Zomato money every year to eat out at ""normal"" prices which will be the new discounted price. That's assuming Zomato captures more of the market. Hopefully they don't! I am frustrated with how expensive online food ordering is. Goodluck to all the restaurants with the #logout campaign. Delivery services :

\- They take so much money from restaurant : at least 20 to 25% if you ask them.

\- They are source of so much plastic garbages

\- Their drivers are so dangerous (for us and for themselves)

Using them is somehow supporting this isnt it ?

&#x200B;

Personally we use the app to check menus and then we go to the restaurant. :D A lot of people found bottlenecks in the program such as , visiting one restaurant for biriyani and another for sweets only (if you only end up selling only the sweets when you've already made a ton of other stuff you will make a loss). Then there were people using other peoples membership. Some literally took away tons of food using the unlimited clause and paid very less, and kept doing it everyday :P :P 

Basically it was a case of a poorly thought out plan where the loss-bearer was someone else. Zomato has since made changes to the program to plug the loopholes.",2019-09-04 03:06:22

We have a liking for masala, colorful and relatively more salty stuff relatively. To a general Indian audience (not the health conscious minority) a rich red/orange gravy will look more appealing than a white looking pasta dish or a grilled meat with seasoning. 

Hence from a manufacturers perspective, if they want to sell in India then they have to adapt to the local taste and tip on the unhealthy side of the scale by adding more salt sugar and color. It is not India can't produce good food, items exported out of India are generally of good quality. here for a good time, not for a long time YOLO..... Reads this while eating Blue Lays.

Food,How Zomato went from food industry fairytale to ‚Äòevil corporation‚Äô,131,ctc5q2,https://theprint.in/economy/how-zomato-went-from-food-industry-fairytale-to-evil-corporation/279592/,38,,neoronin," They were jerks since the time I remember.    
    
Remember the 2014 apology they wrote, for their ovesmart campaign announcing their shift from Bangalore to Delhi?    
And all the review manipulations, blackmails when they used to be just a rating website. This is not just Zomato. Pretty much every VC-funded startup works to burn money aggressively and irresponsibility to drive growth. When the market is mostly captured they fuck over their customers by charging more. Then comes the IPO/takeover stage and the founder walks away stinking rich, while the buyer is left with the mess. all aggregators corp, needs to be evil, in 10 years every aggregators corp gonna fail, It is the deep discounting model which is under fire. The chickens have come home to roost. You cannot continuously offer discounts/free delivery/etc . That is not a healthy way for any industry to run.

The issue is the Indian urban consumer is sort of already spoiled by these startups now. We were used to cheap rides in nice comfortable cabs, and are now wondering why cabs have got so expensive or hard to book. The biggest shock I got when to moved to another country (developed with much lower population) was that nothing was free. No free delivery anywhere, whether its groceries, food, amazon. Very limited offers/cashbacks/points anywhere. It sort of made me realise how spoiled the Indian urban consumer is (mostly due to very high investments and very low cost of labour and business in general) they pivoted to db as a service. dharam bhrasht /s When you sellout and go corporate, it's the devil's work.

Food,The witch's broth,651,cswj9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cswj9h/the_witchs_broth/,237,"The words, ""Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple."" still rings in my ears. My aunt who never had anything beyond primary school education told me so when I was a kid. My grandmother who never went to school knew that the first atom bomb was detonated in Kurukshetra during the battle between Pandavas and Kauravas in Mahabharata. Apparently, this is why not a shred of grass grows in Kurukshetra. Of course, she had not been to Kurukshetra and she had no idea about nuclear physics. But as a child, I had no reason to doubt their wisdom.

It is said that ignorance is bliss. But I firmly believe that ignorance is a curse. It corrupts the mind of the people. Our ignorant grandparents, uncles and aunts, parents have systematically, though not necessarily deliberately, shoved us towards ignorance and false pride. Their inadequate knowledge blended with haughty confidence has rendered most Indians into pompous fools.

These fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday, these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning elections.

The electoral system is terribly flawed. It allows ignorants, uneducated people, idiots to become candidates and since power and money are all that is required, these imbeciles inevitably win elections. But it is not just power and money. People vote. If the people are uneducated, they would not know the value of education and they would help elect ignorants. And so they did. They elected those who would tell them how great a people they are and how quickly they would lead the world. In other words, they elected those who would give them the illusion of becoming a superpower or *Vishwaguru*.

Now that the ignoramus became leaders, it was no longer required to surreptitiously suggest that Newton did not discover the laws of gravity. The buffoons started finding Indic greatness in just about everything and made it their sacred duty to vomit their crazy thoughts publicly. They started investing effort in meaningless researches such as finding the suitability of Sanskrit in programming talking computers. But I hold responsible not just those who never went to school, for being ignorant. Such is the pathetic condition of the education system in India that having MS in Physics is also not enough to make a person educated in Physics or else why would a former lecturer of physics claim that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is found in Vedas? Why would a judge claim that peacocks reproduce with their tears? Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice? Why would an MBBS claim that the Vedas postulated a theory superior to Albert Einstein's theory of relativity? These people did go to schools and universities. But unfortunately, these schools and universities failed to give them an education. These universities washed off their hands having given these duffers just their qualification. I blame the worthless education system of India for the burden of ignorance these cretins carry exactly on their shoulders as much I hold responsible the ignorant parents these people had.

When ignorants come to power, they lead the country towards intellectual bankruptcy. It heralds the onset of disaster for a nation. Such a scenario was seen during the 1930s in Germany when the Nazis came to power. They claimed weird and unfounded theories about science, anthropology and history. They invested time, manpower and money in worthless researches. They promoted occultism and pseudoscience. They made racial laws based on pseudo-Darwinism.

When ignorants achieve power, they also want glory. They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race. It pumps false pride and prejudices in the people. It propels society towards collective lunacy. To assert their perceived supremacy, such a deluded nation ends up declaring war on other nations. Whether India follows such a destructive path or not, will be seen in a very near future. But the symptoms are already visible. There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.",insen2000," I would like to add a few more points

Our education is failure maybe because our society is obsessed with percentages rather than the knowledge gained. The evaluation is so flawed that if you know the tricks you can literally write a movie script for any question and still score full marks for it.

People with degrees who earned it by cheating, tricking, and false evaluation are no less than the uneducated and ignorant mass. Some of these people again use loopholes in the job market and attain high positions in companies only to belittle the hardworking ones. There was a country of imbeciles, all of whom secretly harbored delusions of their own greatness.

But they were ruled by a select few who, while being of the same stock as the imbeciles, had risen above their level of stupidity by virtue of having access to an education system that was denied to the vast majority.

This elite took advantage of the general brainlessness that prevailed among the masses, and ruled over them simply by impressing upon them that they *were* stupid, and needed someone intelligent to rule over them. 

But this went on for long enough, and then some among the many woke up to the fact that if the imbeciles were in a majority, why not instil among them the idea that their imbecility, far from being a bane, was in fact a virtue? Thus, they could overthrow the elite - who had in any case let generations of opulent living dull them into a lazy corpulence - and become the rulers themselves.

This worked better than even they had hoped, for the imbeciles were tired of whispering their inanities among the like-minded few - or so they had thought. In fact, the mindless were an overwhelming majority. Upon realizing that for the first time, the rulers did not look down upon their stupidity, but in fact echoed their inane blathering, they began in ever-increasing numbers to shout out evidence of their own idiocy from the rooftops. 

Thus, for the first time in this country's history, the ruled had found themselves in complete harmony with their rulers. > They cook up stories of a great past that have made them a great race.

\-Joseph de Maistre I live in the UAE and I used to wonder how ISIS took over Syria. Last month my Syrian neighbor said, ""We all supported ISIS because they talked about our religion, nationalism and the most glorious past of Syria that they were trying to bring back. We all stood by and watched as ISIS massacred our own brothers and sisters because they promised to make Syria great again, the saddle of creation that it once was, the real Syria that the whole world respected . But they just wanted to make some money from our oil fields."" This government is of the unkils, by the unkils and for the unkils.

We should thank our luck for there still being such a thing as internet.

I taught myself evolution by natural selection until I grokked it thanks to the internet (especially books by Dawkins and BBC and PBS documentaries). I taught myself interesting ideas discovered by astronomy thanks to the Teaching Company. I learned to be skeptic and think critically thanks to Novella's Skeptic Guide to the Universe podcast. I learned about how our debt-based world economy has been stuttering through booms and busts since Nixon's 1971 decision. I learned from Nate Hagens about how surplus energy is the driver of economy, not money. I learned what science has learned about plants by watching Chamovitz course on Coursera.

I learned why Indian science didn't develop after 1200 A.D. by watching [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmhnQR7xxRg) by Breakthrough Science Society.

You won't believe how awed I feel every day.

But I also understand that the civilization as we know it is heading for collapse by 2050. So, there's some sadness too. I am *learning to die in the anthropocene*. You fail to understand education system. Education is nothing more than a social experiment. It only helps the individual to conform to the societal norms. Societal norms keep on changing with the tide of time. The current acceptability standards in Indian context are towards a majoritarian cultural and nationalistic tendencies. Education will only fall in line to create individuals who conform to those standards. Just wow!

In India, a lot of us are not well educated. We are expensively educated.... In 1453, just before the fall of the city, the intellectuals of Constantinople were discussing the gender of angels. Who are you, bro? Remember, all these crazy shit is brought forward by people brave enough to speak such bs.


Who knows how much more crazy thoughts they have they don't bring out? > There is a witch's broth being cooked, a diabolical concoction of patriotism, pseudoscience, the glorification of the past, nationalism, occultism, militarism and ignorance. India is going down a slippery slope.

This line basically hits the nail on the head for me. For a while I've kinda thought about what Nationalism was and how different is it from Patriotism (I'm just picking these two for now, but willing to talk about the others as well).


I basically came to the my current conclusion ( I might be quite wrong, so please correct me if you believe so). 


Patriotism is where we believe in the idea of the country that it was founded on. In our case a Secular, Democratic Republic. A land where all are welcome regardless of their beliefs, religion, caste, creed, race or anything people have used to differentiate each other (for better or for worse). A land where the people choose, elect and stand by the those they have elected to lead and govern(Not rule over). Place where diversity is celebrated, protected and understood.


Nationalism is this idea that one person or group of persons are superior to others and they alone have the right to rule over all the others. The others are basically on this earth to destroy it and therefore need to be subjugated and herded (Or ruled). Or in some cases destroyed so as to purify the race. Differences are highlighted and weaponized to gain power. 

So, when I hear people calling themselves Nationalistic or group of nationalists, it does worry me since I see them as possibly being so enslaved by this idea of superiority that they will be willing to do anything for it. And that is scary. quality post right here. Germans had very advanced tech for those times but the majority populace were systematically brainwashed  into thinking that the jews were main reason  for all their problems. Thank you so much for writing this. Sanity is refreshing these days. Now all we‚Äôve got to do is SHOUT this from FUCKING ROOFTOPS!! The biggest flaw in everything you've written is that you think that these rulers believe in what they say. They don't, they just have to make you think they do. Judges have to pass exams, or win cases as lawyers before they are so elevated. 

It is the easiest conclusion. When your staying in power depends on you lying to the people about a non-existent past, as a power hungry, devious and clever politician, will you pander to the millions and millions of uneducated/semi-educated, or to the handful of people who will try to counter you with science in a battle which science cannot win? Iv come to realise that the biggest failure of our education system is that it has not taught critical thinking/reasoning skills to people. I see it on my WhatsApp groups where educated people are ready to believe any kind of fake news conforming to their wordviews. People who pride themselves on their technical knowledge and look at data 10 times before coming to a conclusion, are ready to accept any BS in terms of politics or history. We are happy to accept anything told to us by a person in authority. Because that's what schools and parents have taught us to do. Listen to elders, do not question, write the answer exactly in this format to score marks etc. This seems like a very good essay with words coming straight out of the heart of someone who cares for his/her country. I agree with all the points you made. You correctly pointed out the issues in our education system, social fabric etc which are now transcending to an unprecedented national level. And it is really worrisome but then who will voice them when we can't even do it in front of our relatives and closed friends. 

They have taken the blue pill and want to live their ignorant lives not actually caring about this at all. In their view, they are deep patriotic because they are supporting a buffoon who seems to have patented this so called nationalism. 
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing that we have one. Unless this happens, there is no bright future. 
If we want to rise up as a society, we need to develop a scientific temperament. We need to rely on facts rather than rumors. We need to question everything we can. And a good education will only take you so far, it will be ultimately this very society which will make or break our future (which seems to be going downhill for some time) I want to take a peek at your bookshelf, OP. Well now that we have, once again, identified the problems, what is going to fix the country?
If the plan is - criticise so that people get aware...I'm sorry but that's not gonna work. 

Suppose I am a bhakt and I start seeing that BJP is not what I had in mind....I pay attention to you and wake up.

What do I do next?

Do I vote for Congress / SP-BSP / INLD / TMC / TDP etc?

I can present examples of religious bigotry and stupidity from all of these parties. As many as from BJP. 

What do I do, as an individual, when my choices are limited like this? A couple days ago i overhead a conversation among 3 people for 10 seconds while doing some work. This guy started by saying to the other two, ""Hey have you guys heard about Kashmir, i have no idea but i think ...."" And the other two also agreed that they have no idea about the facts of the matter and continued say utter bullshit and some communal things too.


I just sighed, got up and left. Would it kill people to just pick up a good newspaper and fucking read a paragraph or two about the thing and then talk? Just read about the damn facts if you want to talk or voice your opinion about anything. Wish we had an Ataturk somewhere , don't know if that is even possible in an fractious democracy such as ours Very well written post. Would love to hear your solution to this. Well written mate..üëç What you said is actually quite true. And it's not just our education system but the social media as well as news media. I am a resident of Kolhapur which was a victim of the recent flood disaster. We the residents did everything in our to save the lives of those who were affected by the flood. And I didn't see a single media person who talked about that instead it was just who took a press conference and talked and whatnot. The Media is blind about the real situation that they will start to blame anyone without even knowing the real issue. And I feel ashamed to admit that in our country it matters a lot. None of the leaders keep their promises and play the same tape for the next elections. And it's literally unimaginable but also very true that the people fall for the same thing again and again and again like a sheep. It's disgusting. If anyone of you had read the Shiva Trilogy/The Ram Chandra Series of books, then there's a really cool philosophy that was presented by Amish Tripathi in the books. Dunno if the philosophy is actually his, but, that was my first source of this information.

It states that the system of governance, and the region of governance, both follow a cyclic mode, of switching between two systems, called as the ""masculine"" system, and the ""feminine"" system. The feminine system, is based on freedom, creativity, and a light structure to allow said creativity to flourish and grow the system. The masculine system, is based on rigid rules, duty, and honour of service etc. 

As you can see, they are entirely opposite systems, and hence, clash heavily with each other.

Unfortunately for India, we might be in some sort of a transition from a feminine system, to a masculine system, within Democracy, which doesn't make much sense, as democracy works best with a feminine system. Sure, the People take forever to debate and make a correct decision, but, at the end, there's not much doubt about its correctness. On the other hand, decisions in the masculine system are swift, and very strongly executed, although there's no time for the public to determine whether it's right or wrong, before the decision is finalized.

At Their doomtimes, feminine systems become corrupt and unjust, and people wish for a masculine system. In the same way, a masculine system becomes fanatical, clinging to old Glory, not letting it go and restart, and hence, falls to forced implementation of a feminine system, mostly due to some sort of a war.

I hope we don't come to this sort of a fanatical end. This is very good writing. Considering this is your first post it's make it more enjoyable (I don't know exact word I want to use) Is it just me or neither have my parents nor grandparents nor my aunts or uncles have told me or any of my cousins Ganesha has plastic surgery or Kurukshetra had an atom bomb dropped on it or that Taj Mahal was a Shiv temple Easy to state problems. What are the solutions? Wonderful Do you have a fix? Hilarious that you used Germany as an example. The modern day advancements of US, Russia etc have a lot to do with what they pillaged from Germany after the war including soft power.  
Better that you read more about it ? Very well thought and written. Rapists and mob lynchers are given garlands in our country. Supreme court and the constitution is in the BJPs pocket. ‡§ú‡•à‡§∏‡•Ä ‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§ú‡§æ ‡§µ‡•à‡§∏‡§æ ‡§∞‡§æ‡§ú‡§æ. Any solutions for this ? Anyway to reverse this brainwash? 

I am agonised and feel helpless watching people turning into insensitive, hateful and communal bigots over these past 5 years, even those people who were largely neutral or never showed too much interest in politics.

I can easily emigrate , But I don't want to. Because I have many good friends and relatives here, my family business is doing very well and I work at a Indian MNC. I don't want to abandon all of this just because some nazi party is in power. What a brilliant post. Mind blowingly accurate. I wish I could be as articulate as you about this.

Edit: You need to submit it to some newspaper. Are you a journalist? > Now that the ignoramus became leaders

> The buffoons started finding Indic greatness

> When ignorants come to power

> When ignorants achieve power

This kind of language doesn't help things. Snobbishness and elitism won't help you get your arguments across. Your opponents will shut themselves off to anything you have to say. They can easily afford to do so.

I think instead we must sincerely engage with them to understand where they are coming from. What complaints, fears or aspirations drive them? Is there anything at all of worth in their arguments? Is there anything at all that the rest of us can learn from their positions? Do we have blind spots and prejudices of our own?

It's easy to sink into despair and hate. But if we answer hatred with hatred, it will only polarize the society even further. Instead, we must work from an authentic state of compassion towards others without being patronizing. Ultimately, whether we like it or not, we're in this all together. 

You call them igorants and buffoons. Presumably you hold yourself to be a more sophisticated thinker than them. Surely using your superior knowledge and wisdom, you must be able to get them to see where you're coming from? While I agree with much of what you say, i think you're not paying the deliberate push by the leadership to get the masses to follow more and more stupider causes. Remember, the mob that pulled the mosq down in 1992 did not appear in ayodhya spontaneously. So basically this all is Nehru's fault. If only our education system was better than what it was the past 70 years ...

Not sure if to put /s or not Wow!  Well written. 
Mere 'Man Ki Baat.' While the problems you state are true, the criticism is overboard and the projection that we are heading into WW2 Germany is clear over exaggeration.

We all here agree that the problem of misinformation is mostly in the generation we term as ""unkils"" and we see them around us in our own families,does it not mean it is not entirely reflection of their views as people but the impact poor understanding of Internet and modern technology by the their generation. 

Also, winning elections and running country are entirely different things. One cannot win elections by good governance alone. So they resort to publicity tactics as well. I am not justifying the actions but what I mean is though their words make them look like fools when taken literally, they are doing it for a reason and the educated are not the target audience for those statements. [removed] Don't forget Allah split moon into 2 pieces. Fwiw this is global.  Look at the moon hoax folks, the anti vaxers or the flat landers, all of them are educated in schools and yet.... TL;DR Demagoguery. one more Mecca Medina me shiv ling, LMAO Talk about discriminatory sentiments - whatever your political leanings may be, this was a reductive and poor take on politics. Your opinion on the fake news spread by bhakts and unkils are correct. However, aren't you spreading similar things by claiming we are turning into Nazi Germany? This is exactly what the opposition did for the last 5 years. They claimed there was undeclared emergency, minorities will be sent to concentration camps etc but it was nothing but fear mongering and it played into the hands of BJP. >The words, ""Taj Mahal was not built by Shahjahan. It was a Shiva temple."" still rings in my ears.

It is an inferiority complex, it will go away when our society progresses enough. For e.g. Chinese would, till some 30-40 years ago, give examples of how their civilization was the greatest, it invented paper money, gunpowder etc. etc. Now they don't care because they know that they have moved so far ahead that they don't care what happened in past (for the most part). A civilization like us which has for almost a millennia had foreign rule/subjugation would need some time to recover.

>These fools were relegated mostly to tasks that did not need  intellectual acumen. They did their servile jobs and nurtured the pride  that Ganesha had the first plastic surgery. They did their thankless  duties and passed on their ignorance to their children. But someday,  these fools had to come to prominence and they did. They started winning  elections.

Oh come on! What is life without some mythology? I used to be fascinated about my late grandfather(paternal grandfathers elder brother) telling me stories about *Shesh Naag* balancing earth on his head. I knew this wasn't true, but it was really interesting to hear his beliefs. And he would often say - **Mano to bhagwan, nahi to patthar** \- what more rationality could you ask from an older generation of your family?

>Why would another judge declare that Brahmins are born twice?

I am out of loop, but  I don't understand what is wrong in calling Brahmins twice-born? Brahmins are considered - **dvij** (*dvi janmana iti* \- don't remember which *samas* it is) - i.e. taking birth twice, once when they are born and once when they have their **janev** ceremony (not a Brahmin so don't know what its called). This is similar to how birds are called **dvij**, they are born once in eggs and are born again when they hatch.

Dude!! Why? **The wizard's elixir.**

Every Religion, Culture or Nation have their myths, stories, and legends. While most of them are false some of them do hold their foundations in the truth. They are just told through the form of oral tradition, and like everything that travels through oral communication tends to change a little bit in every retelling, so it is very mature of you to call out their lack of education for such a small matter, while you, me and everyone are sitting here because of these uneducated people's hard-work without the facilities being this good in that time and age. And still, there are many things from these stories or ""idiot's blabbering"" as you call them, that are proven to be correct by science.

It is known that egotism is the bane of a man. Yet so many people never let it go, and hold on to the poison that keeps corrupting them and never let them see anything other than what they want to see and believe. You claim that our parents, grandparents uncle and aunts have shoved us towards ignorance and false pride, but that couldn't be more wrong, I speak for myself and many many people I have known throughout my life that my and their parents have done everything to make sure we pursue education and enlightenment. Uneducated they may be but they have given all their life to make us capable of our own judgment and every time they told us stories like you mentioned they also told us to research our-self if we want to believe it or not. And your biggest mistake is in thinking that we (who believe them) are stupid and mind-washed, but let me tell you most of the people you call bhakts and idiots and other things without getting to know them are well educated and believe in things because we are educated. You and other propaganda spreaders will know that if they actually knew who they were spreading the propaganda about, but you just amuse we are illiterate and idiots and most Indians are pompous fools, lol, very educated of you to assume what most bhakts are, But by all means keep doing that and it is our gain. In ego, a man thinks he is right and everyone else is wrong and that is where he/she is most wrong at.

As I said maybe stories change, but even then there is no proof that you can show that the stories are wrong, other than calling everyone idiot. While on the other hand there are proofs supporting the stories if not directly proving them right. E.g.- maybe Ganesha has had a plastic surgery (by the way i have never seen someone say this to me) or maybe he hadn't, but there is proof that ancient India was very capable of doing it, read about Sushruta. It is a proven fact that he could do many complex surgeries including that. Also, it was way before even the terms for them were coined. Ancient India was very much advanced in technology, metallurgy, and medicine. Yoga, Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Damascus steel, Sushruta and many other things and people being examples. And if something hasn't yet been proven right, does not mean it is wrong.

Ah yes, the great argument that government has illiterates. Have you heard about George Washington, Abraham.L, Srinivas Ramanujan, Henry Ford, Frederick Douglass and many more, they were are illiterates in their fields, yet no one has does enough for humanity, science, mathematics, people and countries than them, whoever came up with the idea that educated people can only do great things does not know about what he is talking. Yes, education helps but a great man, a great leader is someone who does better with what they have given and does not complain about the things like, I was not educated enough, or education was bot available at my time. And who said educated people only do good, Osman-Bin-laden was a Civil engineer, Trump is graduate in Finance, Kim Jong-un studied in Switzerland before pursuing militarily university, they sure have set standards high.

Yes everything we say is vomiting and yet you are a man of class and every time you speak jewels rain down. Lol, just because Sanskrit is the best-placed language to be great for coding doesn't mean we have anything to do with it, and why are you butt-hurt even if we did try to research that, research is always being done on number of things, most of which are meaningless just to find something that is not, it is called research for a reason, but you are clearly hurt by that, why? you clearly have something against it, is it that you are a Pakistani agenda spreader with your fake bought account? And who are you to hold anyone responsible? what have you done with your esteem educated self? Oh right, you called most of us pompous idiots and duffers, so yeah that was a good use of education, I wonder why any politician didn't think of that, clearly they need to study more.

You call Nazis ignorant and idiots seriously, they were bad people, but ignorant and idiots they were not, they are famous for their mindset to improve technology and Science. They were the creators of some unmatched technology of that time. They worked and researched all the time to improve their technology and they did it, it took most of the world and countless good lives to pin them down. Just because they drew their inspirations from the past does not negate what they were good at. But you just have to draw a line to match Current India to Nazi Germany, just to further your propaganda, so you do not care about doing even a bit research or checking if what you are saying is true in the least. If Nazi Germany were to be good people then today they would be most educated and technologically advanced people of our time, but you only care about drawing false parallels.

Those people who believe in something just because someone has said some things by sugarcoating a few words are like everyone who is believing your propaganda without actually thinking of what you are really talking about. When wrongdoers and people who like to just spread false information think that their stupid stuff is not working anymore, they try to call others stupid, duffers, idiots, etc but that won't fool anyone who has a mind of their own.

In this post of yours, you have called most of us, stupid, idiot, duffers, and whatnot while never writing anything worth a chimp's intelligence, if this is what educated people are like, I am glad most of my country is illiterate as you claim and idiots.

&#x200B;

So, stop putting so must shit in that broth of yours or someone will find out that you are literally cooking some shit. What rubbish is this? Indians regularly focus on education - it‚Äôs pretty much a core tenet of Indian culture across all states and locations.

Most of this stuff in this thread is toxic- the kind of stuff that leads one to believe that being governed by a few elite is better than the will of the many. I voted for BJP in last two elections but my parents have never mentioned such stupid stuff, they always voted for congress prior to these elections and this time they didn't vote at all. Not everyone voting for bjp has the same background. I have congress rule from up close and know how corrupt they are. I don't give a fuck about Nazi comparisons or any other fear mongering and so does the majority of India.",2019-08-21 00:14:21
Food,McDonald's faces boycott threats in India for serving halal meat,234,cvwmg5,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/08/mcdonald-faces-boycott-threats-india-serving-halal-meat-190826083241873.html,207,,Futurist110," Religion is cancer and religious fanatics are cancer cells Can someone explain to me why people are up in arms about eating halal meat? I don't agree with it but I understand why people don't want to eat at beef/pork. Are people really that offended that their meat was blessed by a muslim cleric? It's not like it's going to taint the meat, is it? Aren't those throwing a fit supposed to be vegetarians in the first place? They have option to not go for meal to McDonald‚Äôs. As a vegetarian I will never understand the ibsession with the type of meat. You can very well go to McDonalds and have McVeggie with Cheese. Why boycott? Are these people even the main demographic for McD? Nothing's going to happen. I hope McD stands up to these internet trolls. Personally I don't like the halal practice, because it seems very painful to the animal. The jhatka method seems faster and cleaner. If we must kill animals, IMO its best to make it quick and as painless as possible.

However I have heard that halal just looks painful but its actually not, so idk. [removed] Halal vs Jhatka is just manufactured controversy 

Jhatka is horrible too. The animal is completely conscious when the head is cut off - god knows what happens. 

Stunning before removing the blood seems to be much more humane. The same bigots were supporting iskcon not adding garlic and onions in midday meals

That guy is the founder of swarajya mag. They will defend not adding garlic and onions in government mid day meals paid by taxpayers. But they will call for boycott of private company like Mcdonald.

I wonder what these guys would do if people protested for beef in government mid day meals I thought the biggest selling point for the ""indic"" faiths was that they were not scriptural. How is this jhatka nonsense different from the halal nonsense?

And it's hilarious to see shuddh shakahari brahmins living in California crying about denial of livelihood to dalits, while I have yet to see any dalit crying about halal. 

Duplicity, thy name is hindutva! Love it when pure veg fash care so much about meat just to hate Muslims Aaiye, ye hai humara Naya India Halal meat is not good. Burgers should be vegetarian and washed in Gaumutra. This will keep the Hindus Hindu and convert the rest of the Mlecchas (dirty people) to Hinduism. I'm safe, I don't eat meat üòÄ Guruji sahi bole the ""kya hai Iss duniya me bachane layak"" Yeh jitne bhi logic wale log hain sabko Bahar nikalo.

Tamas failao ganes. Aag lagao Man i just want to know why mc donalds stopped serving chicken mcgrill and chicken masala mcgrill. notice how, for all the claims of rationality and areligious enlightenment by self proclaimed rationalists and purveyors of all things enlightened, none of them questions the practice of halal to begin with? amazing it is. I will be frank. I'm opposed to halal for two reasons.

\#1. it is a barbaric practice.

\#2. it is imposition of ungrounded/irrelevant religious norm.

Also too:

does mcdonald's india serve bacon? if not why not?

why so much reverence to only one sectarian community? [deleted] I really hope that people weren't getting sick and dying from eating this that would be horrible. I'm a Muslim and let me tell you the concept behind the Halal and why we prefer it.

First of all, there is no cleric involved at the time of slaughter. Halal is just the way to prepare meat. Most of the disease lies in blood and blood is also the main reason behind the rotten meat. Through the halal method, all the impure blood pump out from the body and which makes it safe to consume and also the meat last forever.

This type of practice also followed by the Japanese style of preparing fish. You can watch the [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TS4AM9mPX-8) Mc Donald is unhealthy, treats employees badly and money is going abroad.

No need religion to understand that you should boycott Mc Donald and instead support your local food provider. How does Al-jazeera know about this and we living in India have no information on it. Macdonalds and Kfc in India sucks anyways. And not because they don't serve beef. I have eaten macdonalds in over 12 countries and i rank India as the worst when it comes to taste and the sauce. Its like eating a rat burger but it's halal meat that triggered for a boycott. Either ways go for it. People shouldn't be eating this crap anyways",2019-08-27 13:51:35

Food,Should you clean up after yourself in fast food restaurants?,77,clwug1,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/clwug1/should_you_clean_up_after_yourself_in_fast_food/,36,"Pardon the stupid question, but I'm foreign and just had a KFC worker go ballistic because I took my own tray to the dustbin. I understand that most fast food outlets here employ workers to clear tables, but I feel like an asshole when I leave trash on a table when the dustbin is two meters away. 

I've actually spent a lot of time here in India and still have no idea WTF do in fast food places. Do workers get in trouble when customers take care of their own trash or something? It's hard to overcome my own cultural programming (TBQH I think it's stupid that adults need someone to open the door for them and clear a plastic tray in fast food joints, but I suppose it's good that these people have the work?), but I don't want some dude to lose his job because of it.",LostAndDesserted," 1. Most eateries/restaurants dont expect customers to clean up

2. You are a foreigner. If you start cleaning then they will be left red faced and ashamed that a foreign guest has to clean up himself rather than them serving you  Restaurants in India don't expect guests to clean up after them so the staff will always be helpful. As a personal choice, I prefer using the dustbin wherever available. I went to Subway and there was no one to pick the leftover tray with food wrapper. So, I did it myself and no one stopped me. I used to throw my pizza container boxes to the dustbin in Pizza Hut etc. in South India. Nobody ever even looked.

But in one of the North Indian cities, when I did the same, the entire joint looked at me, murmured stuff, stared at me for the next two-three minutes I was there. So never did it there again. Not ever in the North.

This is about fast food joints.

I never think of cleaning after me in traditional restaurants. no they will not lose their job btw hello nice person! Our great country still runs on Manusmriti ideoloy
Cleaning trash is considered as a demeaning job even if its yours . I remember 10 years back we had no such privileges at McDonald's. Everyone had to put their own thrash in the bin. May be with the increased footfall, they started this. If they‚Äôre disposable items, I ask one of them where do I dispose this off. Most of the times, they appreciate the gesture but prefer to do it themselves because of their bosses. 

If washable dishes, it‚Äôs better to just leave it on the table. Yeah we always pick our stuff up and leave them in the trash can. No two ways about it. I usually do that in food courts of malls I personally clean up the table so all he has to do is pick up & drop my trash in a dustbin. Which KFC was this? Let this be a lesson for Yuppie Indians who learn *Americanese* by watching sitcoms and going to KFCs:  Remember to pick-up and clean up after yourself at fast food restaurants when you actually get to NYC, London or Toronto. May be the restaurant had a rule about some specific food items to be thrown in specific dustbins and the management will give him a mouthful if done wrong? Well, I totally agree with you, I like to clean up after myself in fast food chains and have got used to weird looks not only from the workers, also from the other tables. I mean, what's their problem to pick up after themselves! It's not like you're being told to clean up the whole city! Kudos to you, but the fact that you're a foreigner, especially if you're white, it'll make it much worse, since the worker's 'atithi devobhava' instinct will be inevitably stimulated. So, best thing you can do is either get used to the odd looks like I have, or yeah, let them pick up after you I have cleaned up after as well, in fast food places, and have never been told anything. Have also been thanked a few times doing so, by the staff. 

Nothing wrong in doing the right thing. Lots of people here man. They won't have jobs if everyone started cleaning up after themselves or had parking manners. It is a good thing for India.

Places like subway you can clean up after yourself. They usually don't have doing this all the time. Meh dumbass shithole country lost in its own anus",2019-08-05 03:53:50

That American packaged food are 2nd most healthy in the world makes me call BS. But I'm also too lazy to read the study. So, I'll just call BS and move on with my life. When the regulations are weak and the authorities are bribed if and when they come for inspections, obviously the food will be unhealthy. Probably sponsored by coke and pepsi What were they analyzing, exclusively Patanjali goods? As if our our cooked food is good for health. Theoretically they can be made in healthy manner, but we don't. I feel they're talking about food quality then health because murica at 2nd place is totally bs",2019-08-22 23:29:56
Food,An Indian menu in Japan,963,cpo2mr,https://i.redd.it/yy2kbtuz85g31.jpg,150,,Rockstar762," Was that naan made with a bike saddle? Oh them Japanese and their phallic naans All suffixed with Curry Hahaha love the spiciness index but having eaten there the top of that scale is probably a low 4/10 here. 850 Yen (appx Rs. 600) for a ""thali"" containing 2 curries, rice, one naan, salad and a lassi.

Honestly i thought food in Japan was a lot more costlier than that. Apparently they have the highest prices for fruits in the world. Lived there for an year or so. There are Indian curry chains probably every block or so(in Tokyo only) , owing to the lower costs of running them.

A lot of them don't have actual Indian chefs and run by people from Indian sub continent but not from India. Look how they massacred my naan! That dick shaped naan though :D Mutton curry looking like a bowl of tomato soup! I wonder if it tastes the same or more like anime Blueberry Lassi !! Juicy chicken number one ‚ô™ Did we just catch that naan warping into hyperspace at light speed? *cries in butter paneer masala* >Same drink is free for an hour

That's a sweet deal... All you can have Mango lassis for an hour! This Japanese guy posts about Indian food in Japan all the time. He also sells Indian cookware. https://twitter.com/AsiaHunter_com As a foreigner, this is way more authentic than a lot of the ""continental"" food/menus I've seen in India. Read an article last year - Indian Curry was made immensely popular in Japan by the revolutionary Rash Behari Bose, who settled there later in life. He was known as The Bose Of Nakamuraya there! Dildo Naan. Must be quite a favorite with Japanese ladies. Anyone please make the world understand that INDIAN FOOD IS *NOT* ALL ABOUT **CURRY** 

SMH my head Food looks super oishi All I see is Curry. r/mildlypenis Weebs rise up Disappointed. No dam curry on the menu. I think your naan is excited Orange Gravy. Orange Gravy Part 2, Revenge of the Orange Gravy. Orange Gravy Returns. Orange Gravy with Paneer. *Notices naan*

OwO what's this??? Does it come on the ubiquitous vending machine? that looks yum! „ÅäÂâç„ÅÆ„Å°„Çì„Å°„Çì„ÅåÁü≠„ÅÑ„Å≠!!! restaurant name? u/perennial_imposter Ah Cheese sag why not And so ??? I wonder how much are the price for those ? At least they don't have only a single curry Pricing not bad, yes? I love going to Tokyo, last there 2 weeks ago. I was surprised at the number of Indian restaurants there. Decent food though, and the owners of some of the places I went to speak excellent Japanese as well. Keep Calm and curry on. I've heard of Palak paneer, palak chicken, methi mattar malai but where did cheese sag curry come from? golden necklace on every other dish How is the cost of this food as compared to other food items in Japan? Is it too expensive ? Oh boy CANT wait to taste curry curry Okay boiz, let's start the series of ""I saw your Japanese Indian menu, I raise my <enter country name> indian menu"" posts. Egg kheema curry curry Curry was brought to Japan over a hundred years ago by the true masters of curry, i.e. British sailors. With that kind of pedigree, you can draw your own conclusions on the quality of Japanese curry. Naansense! The Gastropod podcast had a great episode on [Curry and how it migrated to the world](https://gastropod.com/the-curry-chronicles/), especially Japan. The thing about Japanese Indian food is that it bears almost no relation to Indian food except very tangentially. The route curry took to reach Japan went something like this:

Indian currys (which BTW were a Mughal import) --> modified by the British colonists to suit their palettes --> became popular among the Americans (who were also a British colony) --> An independent USA sent [Commodore Matthew Perry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_C._Perry) to open up Japan for trade --> The Japanese emperor became fond of the curry the Americans brought with them and because everyone wanted to imitate the Emperor, curry became popular in Japan. It was still popular only with the upper classes until the Japanese Navy made curry a mandatory food on its ships (it was the easiest way to make a meal containing most of the necessary vitamins). After this [Japanese curry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_curry) became very popular, now being served in schools and cafeterias as a staple part of their cuisine. That's cheap The damn naan is so disgusting. I hate it. Its like an INCH thick. 

Even the ‚Äúcurry‚Äù they sell is so bland. Even if you go 10/10 on the spicy scale its STILL SWEET. So? Us Indians and our phallic naans Above 500‚Çπ üßê

Food,"#BoycottMcDonalds trends online after they say they serve halal meat. So food has religion, says Internet",13,cuauhw,https://www.indiatoday.in/trending-news/story/boycott-mcdonalds-trends-halal-food-religion-zomato-1590737-2019-08-23,20,,Murabajaan," Long ago, I had imagined of a time when McD in India would serve pork and beef alongside its offerings. Looking at the current trends, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll happen in my life. It‚Äôs one of the reasons I also shifted to local burger joints that do serve pork, beef, as well as halal chicken. 

Serving halal chicken is just convenience. In many parts of India, the concept of jhatka is absolutely unknown. I‚Äôve not come across a single restaurant that serves jhatka meat or an individual demanding jhatka meat through these many years of eating out, which is why most places don‚Äôt serve jhatka meat. Given the vitiated climate these days, it‚Äôs only recently that even the concept came to be known. But even then, a restaurant has the right to serve whatever it wants to serve. 

I personally love bacon and beef patties. I don‚Äôt call for the boycott of restaurants that don‚Äôt serve them because they don‚Äôt serve my dietary preferences, nor do I barge into a vegetarian restaurant and demand that I should be served meat and why they‚Äôre imposing vegetarianism on me. You see, you‚Äôve a choice to eat there ‚Äî if you don‚Äôt want to eat there, don‚Äôt. By calling for boycotts and other coercive measures, you‚Äôre trying to browbeat a company. That doesn‚Äôt bode well for investor‚Äôs sentiment. Let us say they boycott McD, let‚Äôs say McD closes down. Do you not realise the kind of direct and indirect impact that can have on the economy? Which company or person would want to start a business in this climate, where you‚Äôre damned if you do, and damned if you don‚Äôt? This is not just with McD. We‚Äôve seen this happen with Zomato, Ubereats, Snapdeal, Amazon and even IRCTC. We have become absolutely stupid, to be honest. I don't get the stupidity of trending this. Every food outlet will try to over Halal as other meat aren't accepted by a religion that is largest or second largest in the world. That is a huge market, why would McDonalds give up this market.",2019-08-23 21:39:12
Food,How different is our street Chinese food from authentic Chinese food?,22,csci5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/csci5u/how_different_is_our_street_chinese_food_from/,26,You know those small Chinese tapri stalls with a chef from the north east? How different is that compared to actual Chinese food from China?,mylackey," Had been to Hong Kong few months ago. Had fee dishes there. We make it spicy and also use way too much garlic predominantly in Indo Chinese. I've had Chinese food in authentic Chinese restaurants here in Mumbai and also from Indian- Chinese restaurants and I prefer the Indian twist. I find authentic Chinese a bit  bland for my taste. Even the spicy Sichuan ones have a numbing spice to them which I don't think will satisfy the Indian palate.

There are variations of Chinese food served abroad since Chinese immigrants there have had to tinker with the recipes to suit the locals taste . I've had American- Chinese cuisine when I was in the States and found it sweeter and more fatty/greasy compared to here.

Moral: **Indian Chinese cuisine FTW** Very different.

Check Trevor James on Youtube (The Food Ranger), He has covered chinese cuisine extensively. Its just indo-chinese. Real chinese food is not like that. Day and night. China like India has different regions with thier own cuisine. The chinese street food we eat resembles food from sichuan  regionof china. To give an example, cantonese food is not at all spicy and actually bland n cold All you need to do is watch a few travel shows on China and you can tell the differences yourself. Their cuisine is very diverse. Very very different. Was in Singapore a couple of months ago.  

Its mostly soupy but bland and its definitely an acquired taste. Chinese food is mostly pork and sea food in terms of meat. It is Indo-Chinese. Some of the cooking styles are similar. However, punjabi masalas have mutated with Chinese and we now have the Indo-Chinese cuisine. The street food is basically totally unrecognisable to Chinese people. If you go to local Chinese restaurants, a few basic staples and ingredients have been totally modified with Indian flavours and techniques. Even if you go to expensive Chinese restaurants which claim to serve authentic food, it has been modified to serve our tastes, but the dishes atleast are a familiar.  

Also, north east and nepali cuisine is a very distinct cuisine, which is separate from Chinese cuisine. It's not the same thing. It's sort of like generalising and calling Pakistani food and Andhra food the same thing (which a lot of Europeans and Americans probably might do). My bad by bland i meant less spicy I doubt if you could find authentic Chinese cuisine in India. What  you eat in India is ""Indian Chinese""
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Chinese_cuisine

From what I have talked with Chinese people, the cuisine is very region specific and not spicy as you would expect. I have been to couple of Chinese restaurants in Canada, and  I came back hungry because a) Very few vegetarian options 2) Even with vegetarian options, most of them involve noodles and steamed vegetables. I believe even vegetarian options might be more suited for general Canadian population including Indians.

Also, I would thoroughly avoid their dessert. What I have seen is they tend to be rice based and gelatinous - not a fan of that texture.

TL;DR - what you normally see in India is not authentic Chinese food. Very different.
Been to Schenzen , and had both restaurant food and street food there. The 'Chinese' food available in India is very different . note that some dishes from Arunanchal, Nagaland, etc are much closer to food you actually get in China. A lot of the authentic Chinese food dishes are so good you'll puke (source: my Dad when he calls me when he goes to China) No chinese have ever heard of Manchurian. Schezwan is not a thing, Sichuan, however, is a thing and is way spicier than anything in India, but it is a diff kind of spicy, a sort of numbing spice ( Sichuan chilli pepper) - it is amazing. 

China, like India, has a  variety of cuisines - cantonese, shanghainese, hainan, sichuan, xinjian and so on. 

You fried rice in local places that taste a lot like Indian chinese, though. They have almost bo breads. There is a crepe like thing, usually with peking duck, which is the closest they have to a bread.",2019-08-19 18:37:56
Food,This is propaganda': Indian school makes children write letter thanking Modi for stripping Kashmir's autonomy,331,cvzyc3,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/india-kashmir-latest-school-letter-thanks-modi-article-370-a9061001.html,67,,hauntin," This is some dark shit . So, apparently Modi will be the ""Big Brother"" after 20-30 years. A larger than life idol used to tame billion people just like China is doing with their leader Mao. Gotta catch'em young. Wah Exam Warrior Wah Children in India are brainwashed from the very childhood due to which only the rebel becomes educated. What they get in school is a vile concoction of hero-worshipping, patriotism, nationalism, religion, obedience and a rat race to score more marks. This is why most Indians have a jaundiced world-view and they are hollow in their conscience and shallow in their thoughts. Supreme leader. We are just North Korea with internet Guess what we will be writing for self-appraisal next year..  The lowlife should spare the children atleast. Breaks my heart. This is indoctrination Hitler did it in Germany, Mussolini did it in Italy. This is straight out from a dictator's playbook. Thus starts the radicalization of the youth. Where else have we seen a populist right wing guy force his ideology on the young and turn them into foot soldiers for his regime? ü§î Their propaganda has long been running through schools like ""Saraswati Shishu Mandir"" and many more, accross all over India churning out ""Bhakts"".
Now they have just expanded to other Private and Govt Schools too.
Just one year of schooling in these is enough to do wonders for them in upcomming days. We are just doomed. I'm for abrogation of 370 & 35A, BUT *I must protest for forcing school children into this.* Even young adults in their 20s won't be able to comprehend the complexities and politics behind this Kashmir problem. The principal of that should be booked by the law. How can any org force anyone on what to think, and how to think? That's pathetic job from that school. sounds like desi version of Hitler's youth to me! Children at \*\*\*\*A\*\*\*\* school were asked to write a letter to PM.

no where does it state it is mandated by the PM, heck, let even the principal of the school. It may have been a *bhakt* teacher forcing their students.

But lets go ahead with the headline and Modi bashing. instead of trying to make it seem Modi is using propaganda in favor of 370 abrogation, this is propaganda by independent to malign on Modi's image. Of all the things they could malign his image, this is how they chose to do it? idiots. are you guys really this crazy? every country has national anthem, pledges and etc in school.. ofc its an indoctrination.. thats the whole concept behind nation state.. people here complaining that its like hitler and mussolini have zero perspective.. or dont know that we literally are like any other country..

now when it comes to the letter writing thing.. its probably one of those over excited teachers that want to do some cool letter writing exercise.. i wish my teachers encouraged us to write letters to celebrities and politicians.. and regarding the topic of the letter, most indians approve of what he did in kashmir..

this is not dark shit.. or we having big brother stuff.. [removed] Independent is not a reliable source of information. This is based on a tweet with them doing little to confirm.",2019-08-27 18:55:00

*Uber* is yet to make a single naya paisa in profit and that's because it subsidises riders, even in the West. The goal of these companies is to achieve market dominance and then gradually raise prices so that they become profitable entities. This may not always work of course. There comes a point when investors shall no longer be able to bear losses. This may happen to *Uber*. There's a lot of chatter about them just burning money. It's not going to happen to *Amazon* though, they are too big to fail, at least for now. When it comes to raising prices, [*Swiggy* and *Zomato*](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/zomato-swiggy-burning-hole-your-pocket-heres-truth-800403) have already started doing it. Kirana stores have been doing this for decades now . Open a kirana store - get discount from supplier by promising long term and high inventory. 
Now sell items at close to 0 op-margins, with low procurement price and lower markups. You start establishing a consumer base in locality

All food aggregators are doing same now. They bring huge customer base to restaurant. In return demand discount on price, pass on more discounts in forms of ads and promotions. Only to achieve one goal of customer retention. Food aggregators can probably work in the long run in India because of labour surplus. The business model will fail in developed countries because the cost of labour is very high.",2019-08-31 06:11:40

I would like you to write the review again and screenshot it before they remove it again. Post that here too. >Delivery guy ran away with food.

I am sorry, but I laughed out loud reading this. OP, you're an idiot, and you don't know how to deal with issues. If the tracking did say the order was picked up and then there was no response, how the hell can you call it ""Delivery guy ran away with food?"" I'm calling you an idiot because you keep repeating that exact phrase in this thread as if you saw him running away with your food. It could have been an issue with the restaurant where they they couldn't fulfill your order hence fake processed it until the tracking starts. Someone else near your house could have taken it from the delivery guy because free food. Whatever, learn how to state your problem correctly. Mention only the things that you know for sure.

> ""I haven't received my food, and the delivery person is not receiving my calls. I was tracking the order and I witnessed the order being picked up and the delivery person moving towards my address, but I have not got my food yet.""

Not:

> My order was picked up and the delivery guy ran away with it

> This is the truth

I'm sure you would have said something similar in the Zomato review, and that is why your review was removed. Ordered Dry Manchurian from Zomato. Received fried onions. Called the restaurant & he said ""Sir, manchurian khatam ho gaya tha!"" Messaged Zomato Support. Initially said no for refund. After 15 minutes of my asking to call me or transfer to somebody senior, gave me a refund. Actually this might have gotten Zomato in legal trouble(even though they would easily win, they don't even want to take chances of litigation). You claimed  (i believe you personally) that the restaurant committed a crime so that can have serious legal consequences. My restaurant consistently gets 4 or 5 star ratings on Zomato, and still our rating shows as 3.7 on the site. Super buggy, super rigged even for restaurants. Allegations are bad stuff on reputation based systems.

When it‚Äôs an information/social system it‚Äôs worse. Either it‚Äôs too easy to mass produce allegations and destroy competitors, or it‚Äôs too easy to generate reviews and game the system.

To stop this, people end up watching their review pages like hawks, and clean up anything they can, in any way they can. There was no delivery guy. The restaurant made an empty claim and you hallucinated that there was a delivery guy. What I understand is you didn't see the delivery guy ran off but he did mark the delivery as fulfilled. You should be writing the events as you saw in app. Not infer that the agent ran away. It becomes a bold allegation and hence removed. 

The restaurant is certainly at fault for the failure, maybe their modus operandi. But your allegations are definitely unsubstantiated. Please write to us the review, maybe censor any privacy-related names of the restaurant and your locality.

Also, the review on Zomato seems as if it was removed by Zomato, not the Restaurant. Try sending the review again. Shukr manao biwi ke saath nahi bhaaga How do you know it an employee of the restaurant?.

Can you actually prove that someone from the restaurant stole your food?.

Unless and until you have solid proof, it is an allegation. 

Zomato is right is removing your allegation. 

You can't go around throwing claims you cant prove on their website. 

The business can sue Zomato for causing a ""loss of reputation"". Rewrite review. Take screenshot of that and this and post it on twitter tagging zomato. Zomato has been manipulating reviews, ratings and listings since a while now. 

Quite a few top reviewers and regular members are paid / given perks to shape a review a particular way. 

Zomato hike up ur ranking and rating if u buy a paid package

Zomato downs rating of restaurants that are popular with people and generate organic orders but do not comply with zomato 'policies' or 'promotion packages'

Their sales team approaches establishment owners with promotion 'packages' every now and then

I have a few friends who own restaurants and pubs and this shit has been goin on since the last 4 years now, that I know of.

A friend has a micro brewery , the beer and the food is below average, a few years back he bought one such promotion package from zomato and all those positive reviews really drove up the sales. 
Its still a joke in our group, as to how it helped change the footfall of that place and how still none of us go to drink there. The beer and food still sucks, but the place does business coz herd mentality zindiabad ;) What did u write again? I've had this similar incident happened to me. honestly, zomato's delivery service is really bad, i use that just for the reviews and order from swiggy. Lol, ye Delhi vala bakeburry hai kya? People get paid to write fake reviews for around Rs. 300. One e. g. is MPL app.. Check it for yourself.. The last time my  food went 'missing' - left the restaurant but disappeared midway, the zomato care rep flirted with me for over an hour . But in the end, she had to still send that 8 pc bucket of KFC. Saw this yesterday...

I deleted my account few months ago on Zomato when they were hacked. Never trusted them. Never liked them. I am more than happy to post my own reviews on Google Maps. In which city/town is this? Asking because I am an avid Zomato user so I like tracking its service. Edit 1: I tried to write the review for the order and it says that the order wasn‚Äôt serviced by Zomato and hence refund has been initiated. Which means I‚Äôm no longer allowed to review an order which I officially haven‚Äôt been served. Almost reminds of chicken and egg story. I want to write a review because I didn‚Äôt get the order delivered. In my original review I had even praised Zomato for initiating the refund immediately. Edit 2: https://imgur.com/gallery/AH9qSqg

We always talk about unemployment, now when there are opportunities they tend to toss it off with irrational excuses Divided by religion, united by chutiyaap Religion will be the single major cause of the destruction of the country. If your religion is making it difficult to work for Zomato, quit your religion or quit your job.

No one is asking the drivers to eat beef/pork.

What next, the zomato drivers will refuse to deliver to people based on caste too ? Why are they going on strike? The job requires them to deliver all types of food. If zomato only delivers veg then the people will go to other's for ordering food.  They will have to shut down in places like these. These delivery boys should just quit their job. And let the people that have no problem with this deliver food. But religion does not say anything about delivering food, does it? Then fire the idiots legally. There's no shortage of unemployed people in India, is there?

> Two of their demands are that the Zomato **should revise the pay order** and the company also must stop playing with the religious sentiment of their employees. 

Of course this issue isn't highlighted. From Kolkata

*Zomato delivery boys will go on a strike from Monday protesting that the food being delivered by them is hurting their religious sentiments.*

*Delivery boys have refused to deliver beef or pork during the festive celebrations of Bakrid or Eid al-Adha to be celebrated this week on Monday*. My God, this is so stupid. When my Pakistani best friend and I worked a part time job in a fast food restaurant, I had to cook beef and he had to cook pork. He didn't eat the pork and I didn't eat the beef. Do the Zomato drivers eat some of the food they deliver and are now upset that they can't do so always? wtf?

They're actually making it *acceptable* to ask the religion of the delivery boy.  If I order beef, I want to make sure the delivery boy isn't Hindu.  If its pork, I must check that the person is not muslim.

This country is travelling in reverse gear. Foreign me Jake  log sab kar lete hai. Sala apne country me hi yeh chutiyapa chalta hai. Politicians trying to get paid. Oldest trick in the book. People were expecting 1984 but got 1857 instead. So proud! *Christian boys rubbing their hands* The same employees who Zomato tried to protect from bigotry. Delivery is unskilled labour. The only entry barrier is a bike, which can easily be funded these days. Zomato can easily replace these guys with new delivery boys. This is unlike a strike in the industries where skilled labour is employed. Oh for fucks sake... The level of entitlement nowadays blows my mind.

You are delivering a package not sharing the meal. If your religious beliefs are preventing you from handling other people's food then you are in the wrong business. Open a Pujan Bhandar or something.

I seriously hope Zomato doesn't negotiates with these morons. These Zomato riders have to deliver food, not eat it unless they decide to take a sneak ~~peek~~ bite. 

Anyway, if you don't like the job, then quit and find a job that you're comfortable with. Zomato has nothing to lose here. Instead, they could just fire them and a hundred new applicants will be ready with their resumes. Zomato isn't a government agency that will just cave-in to any ridiculous demand these riders make. The Zomato Mutiny of 2019... Wait, someone said beef ? Kidar milta hai? Most probably thursday or friday night a hindu rider delivered my beef bhuna in kolkata. Me and my friend even joked about it because of the controversy that happened earlier.I hope my order didn't trigger this. 
(I am a hindu brahmin). Apparently, this is a fake protest. I'm not sure about this guy's veracity, but he's claiming that [beef and pork are not even available for delivery in Howrah on Zomato](https://twitter.com/peeleraja/status/1160568167271297024). Read the entire thread. Waiting for my beef burger to get delivered by Swiggy as I type this :D 1857 all over again. How to do business in India ? I am quitting zomato because i want them to make jain food only. üí™ How would the delivery boys know what they are carrying? Simply don't work at places where such things are cooked rather than creating such drama.

Customers are free to eat any food of their own choice. Delivery boys hold packed food only. What's the hue and cry all about? Next veg drivers should protest against non veg and vice versa
/s What next? Delivery guy rebellion? 

If your religious practices comes in way of your work, you either leave the job or the faith. No business is bigger than religion business. What is becoming of this country! Our country is a joke. Big joke. No matter how nationalistic or patriotic or whatever you are, it doesn't hide the fact that our country is filled with completely stupid people. Beef? Kinda makes sense by their twisted perspective. Pork? Wat? Which politician is involved in this? Must be a cash grab time. The don't fucking work for a job which will require you to deliver stuff. Fuck off then. Secularism on platter. It has all the hallmarks of a planted controversy by BJP. Bengal jeetne ke liye kuch bhi karenge. True solidarity. This is what Indians have done in 1857 against the Britishers. Masterstroke behind this? Chutiye Laat maar ke aise delivery boys ko bahar nikalo. This is so upsetting. Now well educated youth is also getting into such religious biases. When such good start ups are giving employment to hundreds. Religion, which is supposed to unite people has now become a tool to spread hatrate and divide. It is just delivering. No one is forcing them to eat it, wtf lol Religion divides, Zomato unites. isn't this way too similar to that triggers of 1857 revolt ? Quit if you dont like your job kya chutiye log hai bc New criteria for making friends. Hindus who eat beef and Muslims who eat pork and drink. App Idea: Satvik Bhojan Delivery Just like 1857! This is hilarious man either do your fucking job or go and sit in front of Mosque or Temple. > The employees have, allegedly, informed their higher authorities but there is no response from them as of now. 

So god has not responded. That's a surprise. Something seriously wrong with India !  RED ALERT ! Modern day Mangal Pandeys. Calm yourself guys - it's only happening in West Bengal , given the politicisation and tendency to unionise - it's obvious Sepoy mutiny 1857 It is a millennial version of sepoy mutiny!! Yes, when I can't even get something to eat delivered to my house without any controversy just because some delivery men don't like it. Love India Inventing new ways to destroy job creation. Perfect. Let the hindus not deliver beef and Muslims not deliver pork.Rest they can deliver anyway. it's not such a huge issue

I think the money here is a bigger issue This is the 1857 Enfield Rifle all over again. simple fix would be to make sure that the drivers have no way of knowing what they are delivering

unless they open the food which would mean that they get instantly fired for fucking with someone else's food More divide and rule. Zomato: barely saves itself from a religious controversy

Religion: Parry this you fucking casual Zomato delivery boy ""kabhi kabhi lagta hai apun hi bhagwan hai "" Rampant stupidity plagues this country. I wonder how will zomato turn this into good PR. They had it easy last time coming up with ""Food has no religion"".

How can people in their right minds support this bigotry?!? Has Indians always been like this? I'm from South and see people from all the religions living in harmony.

The handle name has references to modi and is followed by the verified handle of the ""office of Piyush Goel"". No surprise there.

People might try to ""enlightened centrism"" all the want, one side is definitely worse than the others and enables this sort of hatred. If this looks like bigotry then you should actually see the threads that's supporting it, from complaints about muslims asking for halal food to conspiracies about muslims trying to poison their food. Ugh. Someone should call HR at his company and tell them that he is refusing to do business with Muslim customers. [People reviews, the ](https://imgur.com/a/sH0amyZ)[tip of an iceberg](https://imgur.com/a/sH0amyZ) In any other country, people would think twice before doing something like this and boast about it on Social Media. Not in Modi's India. A generation of Indians are being radicalized right before our eyes. India is of our Indian Muslims too, and our Sikhs and our Christians.
 One religion - one country is a failed concept bhakts!! Well, the twitter handle checks out!! The boycott zomato tag is trending on twitter. I don't know about you guys, but it's a bit frightening to me. Mainly because the whole thing seems utterly batshit crazy to me. Even the 'month of shrawan' argument is stupid. Why would you order outside if that is your concern because how would you know who all were involved in preparing the actual food ? After I read the guys twitter handle name, I am not surprised about his complaint. The sad thing is, ""NaMo_SARKAAR"" guy really thought he was doing a great job & was sure that many other people will agree with him. Read the following in an article this is what the delivery executive said -

""Han hurt to hue hai. Ab kya bolenge sir, ab log jaisa bolenge..sahi hai is par kya kar sakte hai gareeb log hai... sahna padega sir (Yes I feel hurt. What can I say sir, whatever people say...its okay what I can do in it... we are poor, we have suffer),"" he said.

This is so sad. How can you make someone feel this way in the name of religion.as for people claiming why is Zomato serving halal food there is something called as ""food preference"" just like vegan or vegetarian you are not insulting or hurting someone by preferring a certain type of food.  Amazing response by Zomato though. Meanwhile, bhakts are having seizures trying to compare this blatant incident of bigotry to how Muslims demand 'halal food'.

To their rotten, dung-infected brains, Muslims asking for halal food is the exact *same* level of 'bigotry' as a Hindutva Nazi specifically demanding that a 'Muslim' *not* deliver his order.

How much more fucked up can a society be? Sangh should launch a new food delivery service where you can choose the cook and driver based on caste and religion. Give consumers the freedom of choice. How jobless should one have to be to take everything personally and dedicate time and effort to downvote a company. And also, twitter is full of psychos Whats with the sudden rise of this Hindu extremism? What the fuck happened? Or was it always going on and I just didn't know about it... He should be blacklisted by zomato & all other food delivery businesses. >Zomato‚Äôs response kills it.  
  
That‚Äôs an overstatement. [People reviews, the tip of an iceberg](https://imgur.com/a/sH0amyZ) The whole of Indian right wing ecosystem is supporting him. Fuck these bigots. Most of petrol/Diesel is Muslim country fuel, BJP should ban oil from musalman countries,

Glad I checked Reddit, at least people here make sense.

But seriously, WHAT THE FUCK is wrong with these Indians?

[deleted] Zomato's reply was **""Food doesn‚Äôt have a religion. It is a religion""**

Then why are they entertaining order cancellation because the food is non-halal.

This surely shows their hypocrisy and double standard. /r/HailCorporate Could be scripted. Zomato knows how to advertise by creating controversy! No one questions if the man could have been paid by zomato for the tweet! [removed]",2019-07-31 20:41:30

Food,Why is food allergies less prevelant in India?,39,cc7yq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cc7yq8/why_is_food_allergies_less_prevelant_in_india/,74,"Whenever I see America the food allergies are so much widespread. 
Peanuts are not allowed in school. All package good and restaurants must have allergy warnings while I have never known a Indian person having food allergies .Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?",devgrv," Our immune responses are different from theirs. Moreover, genetics is a great factor that helps us. 

If you introduce children early on (till about 5 years) to allergenic foods, their chances of developing allergy later is reduced.

I'm no expert, do correct me if I'm wrong. Bhai Yahaan jise jo milta hai woh kha lete hain There are way less autoimmune here as well. Read hygeine hypothesis or biome theory. Mostly cause of the conditions a baby is brought up in. 

Americans do spend a lot of time wiping surfaces with antibacterial wipes and stuff, making the child less immune.

Don't really need to explain our case Hum Gareeb desh hain. Yeh sab allergies are first-world issues! >Is it due to lack of awareness or something else?   

lack of awareness does not cause allergies.    

Indians breathe in dirty air, drink dirty water, eat roadside food that's made with unhygienic stuff with unclean hands, there's utter lack of sense of hygiene here. those plastic disposable gloves you see at restaurants: those are namesake. staff scratch their hair, and whatnot while wearing the same gloves. they are just to keep their hands clean. not to keep our food clean.  we do not have allergies coz we are used to these things. we do not get loose toos after eating street food coz our bodies are immune to those germs.   
have you seen friends / relatives that were eating all filthy roadside food here, and then stayed abroad for 18months and come back for a visit , eat idli sambar and get diarrhea ? coz their immune system has gone weak thanks to the sterile environment in Amrikka. Because Indians have been eating all kinds of potentially allergic food since time immemorial, and natural selection has done  what it does best. The thing that does not kill you only  makes you stronger. I'm allergic to shellfish. Indians are least fussy about this. The only thing you will get warnings about is egg and meat. Maybe because some allergies are hereditary. They are too damn clean. Children aren‚Äôt supposed to grow in a sanitized environment. I'm allergic to eggsüòï I remember reading a study where they proposed this theory that unsanitary conditions during childhood actually helps in preventing these allergies. They proved some link between gut bacteria and the allergies I think. Can't find it now. Indians have become mutant, immune to Farzi diseases like allergies. 30 percent Indians are lactose intolerant 

People don't know what they are allergic of Can't just be awareness. If you're not aware of your peanut allergy you become aware in a hurry. Maybe children not raised in a clinically clean environment get less allergies? I have a notion, but because large agricultural companies often pay for the ""science"" to verify the safety of their products and work hard to silence those who disagree, this is difficult to prove. However, I'm of the belief that the increasing pesticides and GMOs adversely affect gut health tied to allergy issues. The most common allergens are tied to industries with the most pesticides: corn, wheat, soy, and peanuts, to name a few. Food allergies were not that widespread in America, and it's only been on the uptick coincidentally around the same time as the higher prevalence of GMOs and heavy pesticides. Agriculture was nowhere near consolidated in the hands of a few as it is today. 

&#x200B;

It kinda makes sense because GMO foods and pesticides are both designed with the goal of rupturing an insect's stomach. Given the genetic similarities between humans and even the lowly fruitfly, I don't know how we can all be surprised that humans experience food allergies, IBS, leaky gut, and a number of other problems from eating the same foods designed to kill insects. Americans eat allot of processed foods. Also there is an over reliance on drugs... allergy is reaction of body that is fighting something it deems risky for your immune system.

Indians generally eat everything from a very early age. so our body gets used to all kind of stuff and also the hygiene angle comes in. Our immune gets used to some germs. We are immune but our next generation might face it. Thanks to our new fad diet and water. There is a theory that when peanut allergies started showing up in america the doctors advised pregnant women to stop eating all kinds of nuts immediately.

Years later it was observed that nut allergies suddenly grew disproportionatly. 

Also a large number of allergy cases can be minimised and eradicated with continuous controlled exposure.

As for Indians.... You can't really actively avoid anything coz everything is adulterated and contaminated.",2019-07-12 21:30:38

This reminds of the days back when I was in my hometown. There's a central prison in it and its prisoners used to grow vegetables and sell them to the general public. A real ""Kaidi Kitchen"" For those who are concerned with profiteering.

The money goes back to the upkeep and expansion of the kitchen, ingredients, and wages to the prisoners. The wages are quite low around 100 Rs per day IIRC and for good reason. They have been doing it for more than a decade I think. In Trivandrum at first, they used to send vans to places around the city where the policemen would sell food packets. Usual spots would be around Government hospitals. They expanded the program to start vegetable farms and poultry farms within the jail. They also started a restaurant next to the prison, which is very popular. This is just an extension of services since Swiggy and Ubereats have expanded rapidly in Kerala. Huh. The more you know.

The 40 percent discount  of Zomato is running will cost.

I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language its actually one of the few times I've written in English that to such a long topic hope you understand !

Last edit - I do not run a burger place :p I own a south Indian chain but the example of a burgers was a rough example to make you guys understand !",Bluebaleno," Did zomato ask you before putting discount on your food? > The 40 percent discount of Zomato is running will cost. Me another 50-70 rupees I would end up selling the burger for 130 and then there is 5 percent gst too this unethical behavior is killing restaurants And local businesses

Can you explain why restaurants are bearing the discount that Zomato is giving, when Zomato is supposed to bear the discount provided by them? Update
 Some of you have some common questions which I will answer

As for source simply call Zomato ask them you want to sign with them what's the contract they offer it. Will not be below 25% 

People saying without them I would not have orders that far its true but I before they started their own delivery (Zomato) my boys would go 7-8 kilometers for even a order worth 160  Zomato use to be a website to look for restaurants you could not order my boys since. Then have been going for 7-8. Kilometers 

Lastly to end this topic Zomato is soon making a place where you would have to buy your raw. Materials from them only which is known as hyperpure which. Will become mandatory to buy from according to my account manager if we want to work with them even Swiggy is buying. Spaces taking restaurants. Under that space and selling the restaurants item under Swiggys name  as someone who's been  in the industry for 12. Years you can choose to believe me or the company but if it continues the way it is many for your favorite places will shutdown thanks guys for hearing me out its been a tough year for restaurants ! > Tldr- Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

Cheating is strong word. They aren't cheating anyone but a lot of their business practice is outright predatory. 

Don't restuarant owners have unions? If not, you guys should unionize and negotiate better deals with these companies. In Zomato and Swiggy's war for customerbase, small businesses suffer. It's the same thing with Uber taxis; they scam the taxi drivers by charging large commissions off an already low taxi fare. Also restaurant owners send half filled boxes when people apply such discounts to make up the loss, so you both are riding the same boat. 

I'hv noticed this numerous times in different cities, try vising the restaurant and getting parcel in person, you'll notice they'll use smaller sized packages while sending food via zomato. OP, let me tell you how to solve this problem but you'll have to become a little tech savvy for that! 

In Pune, there is a restaurant called ""Behrouz Biryani"" who were facing similar problem as yours, let me tell you how they solved it. I used to order biryani from there through Zomato. When I repeatedly ordered biryani about 4-5 times, they texted me a special offer: If I purchased through **their** app in the Play Store (instead of Zomato), they'll give me an additional whopping 20% discount compared to the present price!

I figured out they must be facing the same issue as yours. Zomato, the middle man must be eating all their profits through discounts and delivery charges but if they (Behrouz Biryani) had their own app in the Play Store, people will order directly from there and they can be offered a much better price now. They'll have to arrange logistics but it should be trivial if you are running an established restaurant for a long time.

Try that OP, app development is not that difficult these days. Catch a trustworthy techie and either he'll code it himself for you, or he'll know a freelancer friend who'll do it. The future belongs to those who know how to ace the technological race. We know. Most of us still order for the convenience. The argument put forth could be that Zomato/Swiggy are bringing you new customers that would otherwise never visit your restaurant in person, and so any business is good business, no matter how small the margins may be.

However, on further thinking, the food app economy is killing the ""lets go out for dinner"" economy. So less customers over time will choose to visit your restaurant and prefer ordering online, which will cut into your normal profits, and limit your ability to maintain rent/electric etc costs of running a physical restaurant.

I think the end-game is to have every outlet on Zomato/Swiggy eventually turn into a kitchen-front only, working on minimal margins, with the 'middle-man' taking most of the profit, just for providing what used to be a free service (Menus + calling restaurants for delivery). Similar findings could be made in the Uber/Ola economy etc. 

Sad, but this is late stage capitalism at work. Please stop supporting Zomato. I was at a roll stall yesterday and I asked the seller about how Zomato earns as a middleman-service when you're the one charging for service and the customer is paying to you. He explained it to me and I was like, ""So how does it benefit you if they charge you money?"". He said, ""They bring us work."". I was like, ""Do they?"". And he responded, ""No, not really. We're making the same as before, except now Zomato takes away a portion of our earnings."" Hi OP, a quick question for you.

Let's say you're selling a burger via swiggy for 140 (MRP)
If I were to eat at your restaurant, will I be charged the same? What's the cost of an in-store customer versus one who orders via Swiggy or Zomato? If I order online, you save money you otherwise incur on sitting space, electricity, waiter charges, etc..

Don't you think when you account for all this, the money you lose to commissions and discounts on Swiggy/Zomato is same as what you would incur on an in-store customer? The business model is based on optimistic high volume sales.

Yes i believe this stupid 30% 10% loss bearing system should go away. But this model also gets you a higher number of orders, which otherwise you were supposed to rely on your loyal customers.
So if you were selling 10 burgers to your ""loyal"" customers and were earning 10 ‚Çπ per burger.
Not you're obviously selling atleast 20+ burgers at maybe 5‚Çπ profit, plus the customers who walk into your restaurant.

And moreover, its consistent earning. Its a win win situation, if there is a better loss bearing system. 

And restaurant owners also send stale, unedible, low quantity, half orders etc food which on our complaint zomato bears the refund cost. So, i dont think its only zomato's fault if people keep looking to earn money by fraud methods. Which part is a scam and how are they cheating the customer? Is it the commission they charge you or the discount which is passed on to the clients or the delivery fee they are charging?

I am sorry if this comes across as rude but if you are setting up a business relying on a 3rd party to drive orders then you can't say they are scamming you if you don't make as much money as them. A restaurant near my place stuck to their guns and had their own delivery service. They are doing quite well. If there's a restaurant union near your place, pool in some money and start your own online delivery service. You don't need stuff like fancy GPS tracking systems. A good payment gateway and order delivering on time will suffice. I often order food online (Swiggy) and the shit they pull off with the discounts is outright shady. They'll inflate the prices, give discount and bring the total bill to the same price as it was earlier. 

Also, I was at this restaurant a few days ago. I frequently order chicken 65 from this restaurant which is priced around 170 (if you buy directly from the restaurant) and 210 (if you order from Swiggy), so what I've realized is that Swiggy not only inflates the prices but also adds taxes, packaging charges, and delivery charges which knocks up the price to almost 250 which makes no sense. I used to work at an F&B SaaS company/startup. They make website for the restaurant (with their branding and theme and all), where customer can directly place the order (Restaurant get better margin, and they can offer reasonable discount). 

The competition of Swiggy and Zomato had really killed the business from their website almost for most of the clients.

&#x200B;

Burger King used to run a lot of discount on their website, but had dropped their website for ordering completely. Indian mentality is cheap and wants discounts everywhere. 

I will legitimately give more money to apps to click and order instead of talking on the phone for ordering and haggling with the delivery person for change. Tell me straightforward.

What is the % net margin on your business? Can you put together more facts and figures  to help use understand the issue ?

Also, doesnt these apps increase the number of orders for your restaurant ? How do you factor that in ? Huh, for a year now I've been noticing that a plate of Mutton Biryani from well-known and popular joints, here in Chennai (like Buhari, Dindigul Thalapakatti etc...) have priced it around Rs.270-290 or so. Prior to that it used to be around the Rs. 180-220 range (depending on the restaurant). Sure, the prices of other dishes might have obviously been hiked too, but as for now, this is what's coming in my mind.

Is the increase in price have to do with what OP has posted here? Or is it just normal and typical (due to inflation and all) and I'm just overstating things here? 

But, (nearly) 300rs for a plate of Mutton Biryani is just ridiculous, especially for the portion size that is provided to us, imo. Do you think going for a online only restaurant might help reduce your costs. You will be able to rent some small space for just the kitchen, and it doesn't have to be in the main road.

I remember reading that these type have kitchens have started becoming popular in US. Are there such kitchens operating in India now. Guess it‚Äôs Uber Cheats Just curious, do u prepare Zomato/Swiggy/Uber Eats orders differently from when a customer orders directly from you or eats in your restaurant? Thanks op. I have heard that now they are opening their own kitchen , they would make high selling food items which are high in demands , its brilliant not having to maintain a shop and just a kitchen when can be at a strategic place in city and on whatever place or floor they want and i have heard they are going to recommend their own Kitchen food since it would be tremendously cheaper since absolutely no or minimal working cost is associated with it , but this is very unjust for all the restaurant business owners because they will finally lose those who actually started using the platform because of the restraunts customers and they certainly can't compete in terms of cost to an outlet specially‚Äã enhanced for online order . Its clearly very Injustice to everyone I may be late to comment on this but I after with OP that zomato earns around 100rs per order . According to one calculation of mine at my local Chinese food stall zomato was earning 40% apart from delivery charges and all. Some restaurants in my area are not on zomato or swiggy they are old restaurants and they get a decent footfall from their loyal customers. 

One restaurant/dhaba I used to go frequently. Bcos of good food and fast service was almost empty in what used to be a rush hour. Out side of it was a number of delivery boys waiting for the orders. I feel people coming to restaurants was more profitable for restaurants then people ordering. I always wondered who is paying the discount % to the restaurant


I noticed the price hike as well, earlier the price of jeera rice was 150, after a week or 2 it hiked to 230

I was like why 

Ur post made it all clear thanks op Instead of crying wolf, have you thought of quitting from zomato or swiggy? That way you don't need to worry about being cheated. u/Bluebaleno damn my mom was right all long, good that she forces me to get up my lazy ass and go to the restaurant from where I want the food. Never actually thought about the restaurant owners. I‚Äôve also noticed that there‚Äôs a discrepancy in the prices quoted in the Zomato/Swiggy apps & those quoted on the actual menus in the restaurant. The prices on the app are higher by at least 20 rupees for almost every item. With all the major food delivery apps ZOMATO, UberEats and Swiggy are all operating at a loss. So, I think only the consumers are winning. It's not a 'scam'. It's called the market. These apps can charge whatever margin they want. If you don't like you can order from an alternative.

It's not like there is some law fixing food prices on Zomato. Just being the devil's advocate here for what OP mentions. What's a sustainable business model for them? bare in mind these are not just the only costs.

\- Personnel cost  this includes the tech people(paid premium packages given that the scale is huge) and the delivery

\- Operating server costs (No ordinary stuff considering the reliability and availability requirements of such a massive business)

\- Payment gateway fees(usually \~4% maybe slightly lower due to their scale.)

\- Losses ruled in favor of the  customer.- Making up for the discount's offered to lure more consumer base especially fickle consumers in India and advertising.

Its naive to just look at it from an end consumer perspective. Anyone whose run an online business must know how much money is spent on the intangibles. I personally understand when consumers/stakeholders like OP post this but their expectations are ignorant at times if not inconsiderate.  


Having said that I do not like the discount being forced down your throat OP, OP could you confirm if there is an opt out of such discount for you guys?  


PS: I've worked for quite a few startups under the e-commerce umbrella as a tech guy, such margins are norm. TIL that corporations are sleazy. Imagine that! FML! Have you imagined that without zomato or swiggy you couldn't sell the burger in the first place! No one will travel 5km for a burger!

There no concept called ""potential sale"". Without food delivery service you can't even sell the burger. Very difficult to read and understand your post man. But Delivery companies will obviously charge you,  they are delivering your food to the costumer plus they are providing you a platform to get discovered by more and more people.

The only issue I can see here is the forced discount thing because they app is providing/claiming discount not the restaurant , so apps should give discount from their pocket . Can someone please explain me this properly? I think you people should try forming some kind of unions. So Zomato and Swiggy have no one to get food from and they are forced to treat you guys better. Upvoting for better reach. If you can't afford then why don't you stop the promotion/discount? I bet no app put gun on your head. You could say no to discount. The model the apps are running are not sustainable as of now, I know. We all know these details. I heard some south Indian state is going to take action. See if you could help in the cause. PS: 230 for a burger? Damn.  That's too expensive for me. I'm a broke ass students so I wouldn't know what it's like to eat 230 RS burger. Even the zinger is 140ish something I guess. Do restaurants prepare higher quality food for non discounted over the phone orders? The places I used to order from a couple of years ago delivered great food although at higher prices. Now when I order through apps I've noticed even though the bill is cheaper the quality is not at par in a lot of places. Is this done by restaurants to try to keep up with the discounts? Thanks for sharing. Really appreciate your experience in this. I don't fully understand your problem with the delivery charge though ‚Äî isn't that a part of their expenses? We as customers should pay some amount for it, right?

Also, I hope you don't mind but it's a little difficult to understand your post. As you mentioned, this isn't your first language and I truly respect your effort in trying to inform us on this important issues.

Here's how I would edit your post, if it helps, try seeing what I've cut out. Will help you write clearer the next time.

*""Hi, I own a restaurant and I just wanted to bring something to light. This is the reason why your food is expensive.*

*Companies like Swiggy, Zomato and Uber Eats charge us restaurants a 25 per cent commission on every order we get. For example, a burger sells for Rs. 250. Minus the commission, it is Rs. 200.* 

*On top of that, their discounts end up killing restaurants and bring the value down even further for us. For example, Zomato's 40-per cent discount of Zomato will cost me Rs. 50-70 rupees on the same burger, which I would end up selling for Rs.130. On top of that is a 5 per cent GST.*

*This unethical behaviour is killing restaurants and local businesses.*

*2) They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 25-35 rupees for delivery per order. Zomato earns almost 100 rupees from you and I. I understand it's a business model, but you need profits and the discounts that they are running will shut us down. Your favourite small time businesses will shut down very soon if this continues.*

*TL;DR:  Zomato, Swiggy, Uber Eats cheat restaurants and customers with their pricing and discount schemes.*

*I apologize for the way I have written as English is not my first language. It's actually one of the few times I've written in English, and that too, on such a long topic. Hope you understand!""* Always knew there has to be something behind those crazy discounts. Looks like the restaurant is being fucked over by the Companies. You get orders because of Zomato. Zomato has the right to enter into arrangement with you and it is up to you to accept or not.

Don't understand the issue here. It seems like you just want to make more money while having the  same volume as you get through Zomato. Can't have it both ways. In a free market economy, fairness in competition is touted to be the usp. In reality, it is the market itself that makes profit while the long tail of market participants die. Those that survive are usually owned by the market itself.

For e.g. if you're swiggy, the bowl company (owned by swiggy) belongs to the top 5% and brings in much more revenue than the entire long tail combined causing them to shut down. Similar with Amazon's brands like solimo etc.

In essence, this is anti competitive and would have resulted in the government to intervene, had it been some other country. The only real force stopping anti competitive practices is legislation, which our country is pissant at. I live in Singapore, I'm not sure about the markets here, but what happens there is that the sellers increase the price of the items available on the apps. You can get the same thing for about 70% the cost if you buy it directly from the restaurant. Can confirm. 22-25% of revenue goes to Zomato Swiggy. Jacking up prices to list therefore is inevitable. Good business opportunity to help small restaurants set up mobile optimized store fronts and bypass swiggy or tomato As a restaurant owner what changes would you like to see?  
Any proposal on how to let the such companies earn also?  
If the company didn't offer delivery but, just listed your menu will you get into an agreement with them? I have absolutely no problem with this.Those delivery orders would never be available for you without those apps.You will be serving to the same customer base and delivery to same people who order and live with in 10-15 minutes of your restaurant.

While I have no doubt the food apps engage in some scummy behavior and strong arm restaurants, restaurateurs need to realize that extra delivery business orders that they generate will not be available for them without these apps.How you choose to deal with that is their prerogative.

I wont order from a restaurant that is pretty far away from my location unless its through the food delivery apps.My business will be limited to nearby restaurants.Its the delivery apps that enable restaurants to get orders from outside their normal circle.You cant expect to get maximum profit from these. > 25% commission + 40% discount + 5% GST

Increase the price of the burger then. And learn some business tactics or economics. Hiking the price then offering a discount gives you more sales than offering the product at the original price.  

You have a hiked up price, which gives you a higher profit margin. Use the margin to offer discounts in your own app (if you have one), or for dine-in customers via Dineout/Zomato Gold.

Discounts have the psycological effect of reducing the price to the customer (despite the overall cost being the same) as well as free marketing (on Zomato/Swiggy and even for dine-in on Dineout/Zomato)

The 25% commission probably includes the charges of card payments (2-3%) as well as the GST on their services provided to you.  

> They charge you the customer a MASSIVE 35 to 25 rupee for the delivery per order Zomato is earning almost 100 ruppes from you and me I understand its a business you need profits but the discounts they are running will shut. Your favourite. Small time businesses very soon

I am never charged above 20 usually. With Swiggy delivery is free due to Swiggy Super. When ordering food, I do not account for delivery charges in Swiggy - because they are discounting the delivery charges. They discount the delivery charges because they get the revenue from your commissions. If the delivery charges are high, I am not going to order at all. I am ordering from restaurants 30-40 minutes away from my home that would never deliver to my area.    

Local restaurants in my area simply build up loyal customers and then stop offering discounts. I know food stalls that are running for years due to Zomato/Swiggy.

> Zomato Swiggy uber cheat the restaurants and you as the customer share this !

No, they provide convenience to the customer that even big companies like McDonalds, Pizza Hut, KFC or Domino's fail to provide.  

Develop your own app that is not crap, and support all payment methods, then I'll consider moving off Swiggy or Zomato. Searching for a restaurant, and clicking order (payment is set up already) takes less than 1 minute for me.  

Box8 (Box8, Mojo Pizza and other brands), Faasos (Faasos, Firangi Bake, Ovenstory Pizza, Sweet Tooth, Behrouz Biryani), Charcoal Eats (Charcoal Biryani, Chilli Flakes Pizza) all have their own apps that work well and offer more discounts than Zomato/Swiggy - so I use their apps when ordering from them. But they also spend on marketing and IT infrastructure. I also run a restaurant. And I'm partnering with these guys to deliver food. But when I think, it's a must for them to charge this rate of commission to run their business and still be profitable. 
If a person orders 100‚Çπ worth food, the delivery person gets to waste about 30-45 mins of his time and travel few kilometres. Who would do it for 25‚Çπ-30‚Çπ? Customers who order through these apps don‚Äôt sit in your restaurant, don‚Äôt consume time and effort of your servers, your air conditioning or water. So if you have to pay a percentage to these apps which you save on overheads what exactly is unfair? 

The problem is you want to make the same money whether it‚Äôs an online customer or an offline one. These apps help you scale your business and without them you can simply operate as you always have, but you know that would be a lost opportunity. Restaurants in my city already raise their rates on Zomato for every dish. So business is booming for them instead of them going out of business. Customer has to pay more to get it delivered, and it's fair IMO. Zomato cancelled my order 30 minutes after ordering saying that the restaurant was closed. I lost 100 rs. worth coupon and they said that they would 'try' delivering the next order quicker. worst app for food delivery. Period. Man, this is wrong on so many levels. You can take them to court. I just got out of law school. Give me sometime, the least I can do is give you some preliminary legal advice. Why are fast food(burgers, pizza etc) prices the same in the US and in India? A McDonald's burger in the US costs $3, and burgers here sometimes cost more than that! I think you should stop whining. You are free to stop working with zomato and Swiggy, you just prefer working with them because they bring you orders. 

What you described is not cheating by any stretch of imagination, it's business.",2019-05-22 00:28:06

Jagan Reddy should not have cancelled Amravati out of spite for CBN. Now good luck convincing farmers anywhere else in the country to voluntarily give up their land for urbanization.  

This guy is cancelling anything that CBN started...including renewable energy projects with Japanese loans. Who will invest without continuity and predictability Jagan is a fucking idiot. Can someone explain why they didn't make Vishakhapatnam as the new capital? Or Vijayawada? Genuinely curious. The funny thing I really don't understand is why people are so concerned about agricultural land. All major cities across the world and in India was constructed on good agricultural land. You cannot be like that Muslim sultan construct the city in a place with no water source. That is basically useless people need to stop dreaming and come to reality. Vizag was already getting so many software companies and policies of the new government of AP has put all investments in the limbo including this Amaravati one. Populism in a state which already is so much under debt isn't a sensible choice at all. Lol at the artist representation. Aaisa infra India mein kabhi nahi banega. Naya Raipur ...same fate. Nobody lives there, yet crores and crores spent. The project was very utopian. With hyperloop metro and god knows what. Just make it a minimalistic capital like Gandhinagar or Chandigarh or Naya Raipur and then let the ecosystem around it grow. india is becoming the next china. lol . ghost cities. And people were laughing at China, saying that this can only happen in China because opposition within a democracy makes sure the government does not waste money on such thing. Amaravathi is not seen as people's capital ,it is seen as capital for only kamma caste landlords . People of AP unequivocally rejected amaravathi since jagan never promised anything more than a administrative capital due to states poor financial situation .   

Why construct a capital on a flood plain with zero government land ?  Why does capital need to be the focus of investment ? Everywhere around the world modern capitals are small administrative cities with no industry whatsoever .   

Most people from AP are extremely happy that government is not borrowing thousands of crores to enrich a select few . Damn for a minute I thought it was Maharashtra's Amravati Here is the real situation of amaravathi , don't believe the lies and graphics of Chandra babu .

Food,Aging Parents Frustrated with Society and Economy in general,126,cscift,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cscift/aging_parents_frustrated_with_society_and_economy/,82,"Parents live in a tier 2 city in Tamil Nadu. They moved 19 years ago after working PSU jobs all over India for about 35 years. I live in the US and plan to return in a years time to take care of them. The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India - every little thing irks the hell out of him. Milk price went up by single digit rupees, he is angry, the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. Modi demonetized, he is angry.  The neighbors work two jobs (husband and wife) and don‚Äôt have time to socialize - he is angry. its not like he is short of money, I send a hefty amount every month, but that doesn‚Äôt factor into his attitude. Everyday I get messages about the deplorable living conditions and 360 degree greed everywhere. He wants to move to the US and stay with me, this is simply not possible because of several practical and logistic reasons which he doesn‚Äôt get. Each time I raise the topic of me moving back, he amps up his complaints about living conditions in India. My question to you folks, are any of your parents in such a situation ? For those of you whose parents once served in the military or lived in organized townships, what‚Äôs your experience like and how did you handle it ? Are things really so bad for seniors ?

Edit: 
1. Wow! Thank you all for the advice and suggestions! Some of them have really started a new trail of thoughts for me - so thank you!
2. Many of you have suggested bringing them to the US and have them experience the reality of life here - they have been to the US over 15 times and have spent upwards of 4 months each visit. They see zero problems here, they actually think this is a great lifestyle. We even had serious medical situations but have shielded them from the actual costs.",supersonictaco," My parents are in a similar situation. Worked in a PSU all life and now settled in a tier two city. Their lives are suddenly downgraded by a notch. Can‚Äôt blame them for feeling the way they feel. 

I think the most important thing for them is to have a friend circle. Most of their angst will be seeped in. But then again, it‚Äôs not a full proof solution. My father is really short tempered and looses his shit over trivial issues. I‚Äôve been working towards getting him engaged in some kinda hobby but it hasn‚Äôt worked out. 

It‚Äôs a weird place where most of the Indian middle class is right now. Economic and social changes in last fifteen years have been really fast paced. We, the young ones have somehow coped up to an extent but our parents haven‚Äôt been able to. It‚Äôs not fair to expect it from them. I don‚Äôt have a solution but I want you to know that there are many of us out there. You are not alone. Bring them to USA for six months. Either they will assimilate so well that there won't be any practical or logistical hinderances anymore or they will go back with a newfound respect for India. Ask him to stop watching the news on TV! My father watches TV all the time, and believe me, our news channels are milking anger and making people angrier. Newspaper is so much better but news videos on youtube are cancer.

My father lived in the US with me for 6 months. He loved it but he also realized how good things are for *him* in India. He was shocked when I paid 200$ for carpet cleaning :) :). Grass is always greener on other side

He secretly (maybe unbeknownst to himself) is jealous of your situation and wishes to live life like you since he never got such a chance. PSU townships and company towns are comfortable compared to unorganised Indian cities, move them to a gated community. I have an uncle who is similar. Complaints fuck all about every single thing in India. I would say you also complain about things in the US - the high cost of living, healthcare, etc.

I think he looks at US or other developed countries and thinks it is utopia and that frustrates him about living in India even more. So a little dose of reality should help them keep their expectations more realistic. Has he ever been to the US? Why don't you take them for a short trip? I am sorry if this may sound disrespectful or intrusive(no offence intended) If ur parents are retired from a PSU wouldn't they be getting a good pension? > The problem is my dad is extremely frustrated with conditions in India. Every little thing irks the hell out of him. 

> - Milk price went up by single-digit rupees, he is angry, 
- the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry. 
- The roads are dug up, he is angry, the plumber asked more than what he expected - he is angry. 
- Modi demonetized, he is angry. 
- The neighbours work two jobs (husband and wife) and don‚Äôt have time to socialize - he is angry.

OP. Are we related? This sounds exactly like my mom and dad. Just bitch about how miserable you are there and how the good things in india aren‚Äôt available there and how it‚Äôs too cold or hot or wet it is. And how you are racially abused and even the Indians aren‚Äôt united. They have caste and regional groupings even there. IMO Its not the money your parents are concerned about.

**If our country, its economy and infrastructure is going to shit, we all should be angry irrespective of how much money we've got !**

I understand that you may have reasons to not stay in US or get them there but frankly I don't see any reason to blame someone who recognizes the seriousness of multiple chronic problems in Indian wants to get away from them. I think your father may have anxiety issues more than anything else. I think after retirement he have lot of free time and every thing he is observing he is finding faults in that, even with you not agreeing to him(that's any parent). I have noticed even my father is facing anger issues lately(post his retirement) but his anger is only on one person. Since he is heart patient I cannot say anything harsh. 

Solution is to keep him busy. Anything that makes him happy. Send him on trips introduce him to some hobby classes. I also have asked my father to tutor kids once he is free from his current commitment. The issue is not money which you mentioned. The issue is may be mid life crisis. They are retired. Living alone in India. I assume they are around 65 to 70 years old. Life definitely is hard for them. They miss their kids and grand kids. If they get it, then they will be happy. Also, they do not socialize enough. As you mentioned the neighbours are busy. In our typical middle class families, many people think too much about their neighbours, I mean poke their nose about what they do. They go insane sometimes. We will also be in that phase in next 30 years. It's natural and real. Move there soon and things will be fine.
Also, after a certain age, they lose their temper and judgement. They become angry, they become bossy. They misbehave. It is very hard to fast changes that are happening around them. They comment something like"" humare zamane mein"". I am surprised no one has brought this up. He wants to be with you. If you move back to India, it will sort one of the problems. You need to take over his finances and make sure he socializes! Retirement is very tough on PSU employees, especially the ones who have worked more than half their lives there. 1. Get a basic health check done. Vitamin D/B issues lead to anxiety and depression and subsequent anger.

2. India today is tougher and more difficult. Massive unemployment that no one acknowledges, farmers living on subsistence, declining health and public facilities etc. In the middle of all this, there is a wave of orthodoxy sweeping smaller towns and that leads to issues as well.

3. Wean them off TV. TV has bombastic news and guaranteed to make people insecure, angry and constantly provoked as hell. I hear you OP. This is Elderitis. I hear so many crazy stories about cranky elders in my parents' social circle. Each one has a major gripe(hilariously silly in my eyes) over which they utterly lose their shit for weeks. I tried to stop my parents from interacting with negative-like-a-plague seniors(DIL hates us, son wants bigger share than daughter, bones are aching) but it is futile.

The only elders that I see happy are those living in a gated apartment community, have a group that meets daily for walks, have a spouse who is alive, dependable caretakers and kids settled abroad for good. Money is not a solution at all, and having their adult kids living with them usually introduces a different set of problems on a hellish scale.

The lasting solution has to come from the elders themselves. I try my best to make time to talk to my parents about good times, and on topics that interest them. This alleviates the situation to some extent but ultimately it is their mindset that will be the deciding factor.(I know an aunty whose 2 grand-daughters are in cushy jobs and nice marriages, but she moans 24x7) >I send a hefty amount every month

Your parents don't have their retirement sorted, after working for 35 years? Are *you* planning for your retirement or would you expect your children to fund your retirement too?

>He wants to move to the US and stay with me, this is simply not possible because of several practical and logistic reasons

What are these reasons? And how do you think your moving back to India will make everything A-OK for your parents? and for you? Your dad sounds like a real pain in the ass if I‚Äôm being honest. If he‚Äôs cribbing about the cost of living in India, imagine the shock he‚Äôd get if he ever moved to the US. 

You should fly him out for a couple of weeks. That should set him straight and realize how good he has it > Milk price went by single digit rupees

Doesn't milk cost $8 for a gallon in US?

> the underpaid maid asked for a raise - he is angry

He's not going to have a maid in US, who's going to take care of him then?

Money isn't a thing, I guess he has a rose tinted view of US for some reason. If you were living in Europe then I could understand his excitement for living there but I won't prefer living in US in old age. Medicines are expensive and you have got no one to help you(unless the wife is a homemaker)

Try to make him understand how things are in US. Tell him that things aren't cheap and you can't haggle. Plumbers and maids will empty his pockets. If he's complaining about neighbours now, what makes him think Americans around you, or even Indians living around you will be ecstatic to talk to him? He's just the complaining type, it's alright OP, you do you. Mom's are great, they usually have their duties they do everyday, and have done so for years.  Including worrying about you, and tryhing to help.  Dad's are great, if they have something to do in retirement.  However, Dad's who focused on money at work and ignored family with no retirement plan execpt to hang out at home are trouble.  They did what they did and focued on Money for the family, and little else.  If they don't have a ""retirment"" buisness, they feel abandonded by kids who are not at home asking for advice, and being able to give it.  ""Retirment"" for the middle class will not be kind in the Consumer Era with Intrest rates higher than 3%.  Basically in this situation, inflation of 7-12% is making stuff out of reach for what he could buy when he was working and intrest rates are a bit less than inflation.

Even if there were grandkids to take to school and bring back, he would feel abandonded and unable to contribute.  Something simple as being a landlord will give him puropose or managing some property for you.  In other words, he needs a purpose where profit is involved Instead of being ""stewing"" his how his retirment income can't keep up with and increasing costs.  And we are not taking about simple things, we are talking about asparational consumerism.  I.e. keeping up with the neighbors and former colleagues, who have moved to better places(using their sons money).  Unless you are giving him tons of money, or he does not have a job he won't be happy.

The other thing to keep in mind, India is not what it was.  City dewalks and public transport are unusable by the older folks (dad's included).  India was not about making infrastructure usable for older folks to get out of the hosue.  So when the average congested neihbroorhood streets get ripped up for bigger cars, there is no place local place to walk to.  The wealtheir have the manicured lawns and gated communiteis.  So they need to use the more expensive transportation, which they didn't use when they were working.  And even frustrates me,  imagine how it bothers your dad. Have you considered advising or arranging for your father to seek psychiatric help? Walnut one per day, shelled opened before eating, eaten before dinner, (1, ask doctor if he is on any medication if its ok to eat walnuts, 2, if he is on blood thinners medication then also you can't do this)

My life changed

My mum's life changed

My entire house changed

If it works out for you, let me know in a week and pay it forward Tell them about the gun violence/shootings in US. Tell them about the racism not whites have to face. Tell them about the cost of living/maid etc. 

Also how most of the people may feel homesick in US, how bad the kulcha is there, people hooking up left and right etc. He's complaining most probably because he wants to move to the US. As someone said, if it's possible to get him a short trip, he might see the conditions there and help him decide on what to do. you should be proud of your Father that he's not a Bhakt. Things are how you expect it to be, not great for all, but nothing bad specifically for elders. With an average 5% inflation rate prices are bound to go up. The infrastructure in this country has almost always been the same with snail paced improvement.

Looks like his frustration is *not just* about society in general but could be something else. You mentioned that you do send money for them. How do you think it's going to be any different after you come back? Something: exists

OP's dad: Vada vom vom vada vom vom vada vom He's retired, my guess is he doesn't really have a hobby to pass the time. So he is using the national pass time, getting angry at trivial things. This is what happens when you work your ass off on a job and then when you get home you are too tired to do anything else. You don't know what to do with your life after retirement.

Ask your dad to ditch Whatsapp & Youtube garbage and do something productive with his time. Something he can enjoy doing. Yeah sure this sounds like child parenting the parent, but this is what he needs.

You can also try getting him a pet. Pets are wonderful creature and can help regulate behavioral problems in people. Even something as low maintenance like a parrot can do the trick. saving this thread hoping for an answer! we are lucky that a close relative stays at our place to take care of my parents, we provide housing and food obviously and send money home for food and related expenses, but yes we are always on tenterhooks as life under Modi¬∫s rule things are very very unpredictable, in our area, maids and assorted labour like gardners, plumbers etc. seem to have disappeared and we have to get them from very far off. food pricing hikes is another pain in the neck, things like flooding and riots etc, just mean more tension for us out here. But so far we have managed to get by all thanks to the one guy staying with my parents. > My question to you folks, are any of your parents in such a situation ?

No. But, I am in your parents' situation. A complaining sourpuss. You will have to ask my kids few years from now. Brought my parents to the US for a month's visit. They don't want to come back. 
Socia life sucks, food sucks, no one on the roads, too cold, every thing is so far away etc. were some of the reasons. It seems like the problems you've mentioned aren't the ones that are really the cause of their irritation. Probably they are just anxious and a little stressed out about something. Could be because it's a new place, or because you aren't around them, or some other thing in their lives.

One of the reasons these apps are so popular here probably is because while the food in the restaurants is decent, the ambiance is terrible at most restaurants. It's much more comfortable to order food and eat at home. The discounts also help. A dish costing 300 rs in a restaurant costs 240 rs if I order from swiggy. Sometimes crunchiness or freshness takes a hit, but when it doesn't, online food ordering is wonderful. The bandwagon effect is too damn prevalent in Hyderabad. Take any fucking thing, once fire catches, everyone would be doing the same thing. Everyone watches the same comedy shows, everyone watches the same movies, everyone goes to 'ram ki bandi' at 12am and everyone visits Charminar in the night to feel they're the 'cool' guys.

Everyone seems to be using swiggy now. My 8 year old nephew, my >50 year old parents inclu. I know many college kids who now deliver on swiggy for pocket money, and the next day they'd ordering from swiggy to spend that money. It's so funny. They don't deliver to my place. üòû How is Hyderabad a Tier-2 city? I am from a small town. A suburb of Mumbai though. Swiggy & Zomato do not even provide service here. Now we have our own exclusive app. Almost spent 7-8k on online food orders , people are becoming more lazy and eating more outside food without even going out.  
this will lead to more health issues as we all know about the hygiene standards and ingredients at restaurants.",2019-07-19 19:04:45

With this, there is no way things are going to improve for Anganwadi now. How the fuck we allow such baboons to represent us. I agree : Let's make toilets inside temples.

Checkmate BJP  jiske name me hee mithai ho, usse zyada umeed nahi mijhko A few centuries ago, the taboo on shitting near home and water kept people safe. She is still with the taboo, when she justifies cooking food inside toilet because its the age of indoor toilets. We can't expect better from the people soon. This is revolting Lol

Better than having 600 million street poopers Why do they defend this shit?

They just need to say 'We are looking into this issue and will take appropriate action once we ascertain the facts'.

It's that's simple. And our ministers cannot even do this. I can't fathom their logic. They act similar to a dog that was given a bath because it was dirty. And post the bath,at the first  given opportunity, the dog will jump back right into the mud. They just can't stand staying clean.

I live in a hosel and eat mostly from my office canteen or from outside. I'm spending more than 250 bucks a day and still my calorie intake barely cross 2000. There are no facilities to cook where I stay nor do I get the time to.

Can anyone provide suggestions?",azorahai7," You can drink Sattu everyday. If you are drinking it from the road it will cost you 10 Rupees. If there are no Sattu vendor then you can buy them online or from a store (a small packet costs 25 Rupees, will last 2 glasses. So 1 glass=12.5 Rupees). Search Google or YouTube for tutorial about how to make it (spoiler: you will have to add onions, chilli, black paper in that drink)

A glass of Sattu has approximate 327 calories, low fat and 27 grams of protein. It is 100% organic and natural. It also keeps you full for a long time. It's very popular in Bihar, West Bengal, Nepal etc and especially among labourers because it's cheap and gives instant energy.

I'm in the same boat. Trying to gain weight and build some muscle. But I can't afford any supplement. So I drink one glass of this Desi drink everyday (hoping to drink 2 now), the results have been satisfying so far. Of that 2500, what's your preferred breakdown in terms of protein/carbs/fat and what are you getting right now? Peanut butter hands down, but only if you like the taste. Banana shake? Chicken 65 Peanuts.

A 50g Haldiram Salted Peanuts costs 10/- and has more than 300 calories and its too tasty. You can easily much 3-4 packets a day :-) Peanuts have high protein content too, which would help in muscle building too. Basically peanut butter smoothies with whey protein, one extra meal a day, Greek yogurt when you feel hungry. You also need to workout more intensely. I guess Upma is calorie rich with the ghee and all? Blend 100gm oats, one big scoop of peanut butter, one big banana and 250ml milk(or soy milk if you can't take milk). Add curd/yogurt if you want. That should get you close to 600+ calories. Visit /r/gainitmeals for more such shakes. Eat fried things and lots of sugar and fat stuff.",2019-07-21 21:59:05

I was wondering is this all that there is to life? A fellow teenage Indian has taken r/Tinder by storm and here I am, just spending days beating my meat! Exactly a month ago someone promised me a beer treat in South Delhi when I was broke. Kind people exist but get lost soon :( So there was this street puppy that was born near my home. I used to give her roti, milk etc every day twice a day since her mother brought her out from the dry drain shelter (in which she had given birth). In about a month or two, the puppy was in good health and a rich black shiny fur. But then she (puppy) died suddenly. Something happened to her and she didn't eat for 2 days and died on the 3rd. Her death affected me so much emotionally, I was surprised. So I have decided not to own a dog, because I just can't imagine the grief when a dog dies (naturally) after 10-15yrs.

(My bday is not in July. Or anywhere nearby. Just recalling) Last night in Goa! What a premium grown up trip I had! So I am going through arrange marriage process and I will use this thread to post my daily updates, if that is okay.

I am 30, M. I work in IT. Never had a GF. Two years ago, I was deeply infatuated with a close friend of mine and she said no when I expressed my feelings. I was depressed for a while, but somehow got better. I still have my bad days. But, from that point on I have become socially awkward. I can't hold a conversation, properly at all. Sometimes, I go blank and I don't know what to say. This never used to happen with me earlier!

Signed up on Matrimony sites and I got soooo many matches/interests. That actually felt good, lol. 

So I was talking with a girl, my first match and turns out she uses reddit too. We had a nice convo around for an hour and that was the longest convo I could have, after that incident. Come next day, I was not able to talk at all. I was able to see that she was putting effort and trying to make better for me. But, for how long? Next day I messaged her, but same stuff. I apologised to her and lied her this is not working for some reason. This was 3 months back. 

Next stories / meetups have also been same. But I will tell them about later! Finally going for further education after a year and half. Looking forward to this! Going to sleep, fuck you all. Yesterday i learnt that if somebody compliments you, you compliment them back and never pop medicines without prescription. Any good vape eliquid websites ? 
And good eliquid which you are aware of ? Goodnight and kiss to u/ssj_cule College 1st year is going to start from next month, hope I can have fun.

In the last seat, the last window [behind the last woman reserved seat] i saw a girl and a boy. Barely 4-5 years younger than me [say first second year of college]. In that packed bus i saw the the boy bending slightly to the front and turn to the girl and go in and the girl reciprocated and landed a kiss on the boy's lips. Then the boy went further low and landed a kiss on the girls left boob. All this within 2 seconds. 

I laughed slightly at the young kids' experience of love but just then fear grasped me. What if anyone else saw? What if other other people grab hold of them and start beating them? I know Kolkata is not an idiotic cow belt city but even here sometimes these arent accepted by the old farts [remember the couple beaten in Kolkata Metro last year?]

I then questioned the very point of India, where people cant even live and love without fear.

I did not know where else to post this, so I hope this is appropriate. I've never in my life tried Indian food until today. Where I work, at the cafeteria, I decided I would try some Indian food. I honestly do not know what I even got.. to my regret.. I just pointed at something random and they served me a plate of this chicken with some type of thickish orange sauce (some type of curry?). It was honestly the most delicious thing I have ever eaten. Anyways, there's an Indian restaurant near me and I plan on ordering food there tomorrow. What are your recommendations of what I should try next? I'm thinking of a chicken entree. 

Here are my options for that:

https://imgur.com/uZ9XO4M",WinRARHF," Personally I'm a non Indian who loves all things India. I'm a mostly white girl from Indiana. (no relation, lolol)

I love both butter chicken, which I think you had, and chicken tikka masala.  Those are great easy starters. A biryani is a meat mixed with rice dish. Unless it says veggie biryani lol. 

Tarka dal (various spellings) is delicious, that's a lentil dish.  Any dal is a lentil dish, those are staples and there are a million kinds but a few classics. Chana means chick pea.  there are ""saag""  dishes, these are greens. Spinach, etc. If it says aloo that means potato. Paneer is a kind of un-aged cheese, like queso blanco. Something described as pakora will be fried. 

Then there are all the pickles and chutneys. 

Most things will be richly flavorful but they don't have to be spicy the way a lot of people think about that word.

Edit: thanks for all the love on this comment. You guys are great. 

I'm going to admit some cultural appropriation here. I have a tattoo that is an Indian saying written in Sanskrit. It was r/India who helped me decide the best way to write it, and what you guys came up with makes it a paradox, which I love. It reads both ""a garland in a monkey's hand"" and ""a garland in Lord Vishnu's hand"". I got it as an homage to my love of India and as a reminder to myself to not be the monkey OR the garland. To be a good steward of the delicate and the vulnerable both in myself and in others. 

To those who might take offense that I did that, I am sorry. I know it's kind of gauche but I love my tattoo & get compliments on it almost daily--there are flowers around it, specific flowers with specific meanings, and it's done in a henna kind of style. Thus far, no one has told me that it actually says ""waiting for the number six bus"" so I'm hoping it doesn't... There's a high chance you just tried India's greatest gift to the culinary world - butter chicken. 

What you should order tomorrow really depends on what kind of flavours you like. Since you're just exploring, try the chicken tikka masala, and pair it up with a couple of naans of your choice. Did you buy WinRAR license? Hi OP ! There is a sub dedicated to r/IndianFood if you want to dive deeper. And you might get more nuanced suggestions there.  Also my choice from your list would be the 'Methi CHicken' as it will be completely different from what you tried yesterday(probably CHicken tikka masala. Ha-ha, welcome to your lifelong addiction my friend-take it from one who knows, once you pop, you just can't stop. I'm a 51 year old white guy from a provincial town in the UK. My first experience was aged 15 in an Indian corner shop called 'Johals' in my hometown. Knew the guys in there fairly well to talk to. Went in one day for milk and spotted a box of triangular pastries on the counter..

""What are those Mr Johal?"" 

""They're samosas RajBandar"" 

""What's a surmiser?"" 

""Samosa. They're nice, try one, free of charge"" 

I thanked him & walked out of the shop. Went up the road munching it, and despite the *tiny* amount of chilli inside blowing my head into orbit & making my eyes and nose pour,(I'd never tasted chili before this)  I'll never forget biting down on a freshly roasted cumin seed and letting that floral, earthy flavour bomb detonate and dance across my tastebuds. Twenty five years later I got on a plane at Heathrow for Delhi. In a happy miracle it all happened again! The Indian food I'd experienced at home was sort of the same but in India..my god, I can't describe the first time I had a simple thali and a garlic naan. I stepped into the desi elevator and took a straight vertical ride to food heaven. And a literal auto ride to Old Delhi. I could bore the shit out of this sub for *hours* rattling on about soft galuti kebabs, gossamer-thin rumali roti, daulat ki chaat disappearing on my tongue, *feeling* diabetes setting in after two gulab jamoon & some burfi from Haldiram, not caring and having more....etc etc. Even a simple masala chai on the corner and talking gupshup with the chaiwallah unkill while I drink it brings me deep joy these days. Especially when he opens the tin he keeps under the counter, opens it and offers it to me, saying *""Biskoot?""* 

If any other *gorapakora's* are reading this and thinking about travelling to India to sample her delights, edible & otherwise, stop thinking & do it., you won't be sorry. If you're anything like me you'll be unequivocally, incurably, head-over-heels in love from the outset.

Edit; I'm still getting on planes 12 ish years later and going to India. Trip number ten in the autumn and nine months has been too long for this masala junkie. I'm straining at the leash to get back, see you soon *Mataji Bharat* ‚ù§Ô∏è Chicken Tikka Masala is something I've heard a lot of non-indians like. So you can try that. Most of these are going to be similar to one another. No way this place has that much differentiation sitting around. I would go with Chicken Kadhai, it's a bit spicer than the others. Go for dosa and chutney/sambar during breakfast lol. Many non Indians like that..
Have tea/coffee along with that. Should be good. 

Tastes even better if it's raining outside! Come to India lol. You'll be mind blown. You should try biryani. Try indian sweets like gulag Jamie, rashgulla, jalebi Considering those are options that you have, then try them in the following order. Have them with naan, or tandoori roti or just plain rice. Order a side of green salad or make one at home.  

1. Chicken Korma
2. Chicken Muglai
3. Chicken Kadai
4. Butter Chicken
5. Chicken Tikka Masala
6. Chicken Saag
7. Chicken Jalfrezi
8. Chicken Curry
9. Chicken Vindalo
10. Chicken Kolapuri

This is sorted from least to most spicy, so that you get accustomed to the spices and be light on your stomach. 

A little lime goes a long way with these dishes.

And as u/thelielmao mentioned take care of your stomach, indian food will play a number on you, so pace yourself. Now you know the reason for 2 things.  

Western Colonization of Indian sub-continent.  
Western Youtube channels with their Indian-Food-tasting videos jacking up their view and subscriber count by multiple orders of magnitude. Glad you liked Indian food! There is a lot of variety in terms of cuisines and flavors as they change depending on the geography they come from. I hope you like the other types of Indian food too! Cheers! r/IndianFood Bloomington, MN. :)

Enjoy Indian food. It's a drug. Just remember there are mainly three types of famous delicious chicken cuisines:

  
1. **Butter chicken**, mouth watering! hell fucking lot of calories. But it's ok to have some times, i'd suggest to have it with butter nan. Not everyone can give you the real taste of it, check reviews before ordering.

2. **Afghani chicken**, named differently depending upon place to place.. it's works as starter with drinks, it's basically chicken with lot of cream on it, it's totally yum! again high in calories but not as high as BC.

3. **Tandoori Chicken**, baked in [tandoor](https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt/229253608/HTB1CR8sQXXXXXaUXVXX760XFXXXt.png). Basically a spicy chicken marinated with indian masalas and roasted in Tandoors. It also works best with a beer, also less in calories(though also depends upon how much oil you put).  


These are main three chicken cuisines, you should try, rest of the things mentioned on menu are branched from these three only. Also, these three are named differently depending upon place to place. Tell you what, chicken tikka masala with either roomali rotis and a cheese garlic naan.

Butter chicken with plain naan and rice.

Chicken kadahi with naan.

These would be the most preferred combinations here. Then you can sample the rest. 

But be sure to have some water nearby. I have seen a few Europeans eat the same dishes with gusto in Goa and then be covered in perspiration. 

All the best! I LOVE THIS THREAD. You've have had lot of chicken dishes suggestion, I'll just say do try some Indian veg food too, it will get you an appreciation of veg food. first step done, now try cricket. [deleted] Try Jalfrezi next time.

On a side now, I hope your body is ready for tomorrow.

Don't 'lose' hope, exotic food will reshape your gut flora! üòÇ [deleted] 
https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianFood/
Is good a sub You should choose depending on your spice bearing ability and how spicy that particular restaurant makes it. Butter chicken and Chicken korma would be kinda less spicy usually. A good korma would be delicious with Indian breads. Butter chicken is a classic. You could also try these curries with ""ghee rice"" or plain rice. You can ask for ghee rice they would probably make it for you.  Chicken Vindaloo is a goan preparation that is vinegary and goes well with plain rice more than breads. The rest are more suited to be had with breads. You can try Chicken Mughalai once !! r/IndianFood",2019-06-07 14:38:10

Plus so much food in just 127 bucks? F\*\*\*\*\*g A! If they are trying to launch a commercial business out of it, I hope they are paying the inmates wages equivalent to what they would get outside for a similar job. I also hope that part of the profit goes towards development within the prison. I've tried these prison made foods. They are very very nice and cheap. I hope this works out properly A great idea! But I'm not so sure about jail hygiene, from what I have heard about conditions in jail. Brilliant. Getting them to work. I don't understand why anybody can think this is a good idea. Looking at prison labor as profit is a dangerous slippery slope, not to mention that the laborers are being denied the fruits of their labor. This is highly unethical. No one should make money from prison or prisoners. If you don't want to waste the products prisoners create, give them for free.

The complaint was addressed and bed roll was provided within next 10 minutes. Also got a confirmation call for ticket closure. Didn't expect this kind of service.,ccchn," How to register complaint online? Through irctc? Railways services have improved a lot in last 6 years or so. Food is better and complaints are addressed really fast and the damned website got facelift. i have had opposite experience travelling in north side trains , despite making reservations sleeper feels likle general coach with over crowding. To avoid it i started booking 3Ac , even then people used to enter and crowd the coach. When complained on twitter they would respond saying action will be taken but nothing happened. When i arrive at destination i get message saying action taken :< Not in shadabhi and rajthani atleast, they provide bf lunch and dinner in a small amount that you have to buy again by either paying the distributor or get down in next station and buy from shops selling eateries

Edit: before privatization quantity and quality was far better I have used something like coachmitra and got the 2AC compartment cleaned once. It works. I dont think it would work out in sleeper coaches though. We have very low expectation of Indian railways because it has a monopoly. Imagine if there were Jetrailways, Indigorailways, Kingfisherrailways, and Indian railways simultaneously, cleanliness and service would have had their own level! Hey OP. Anecdotal evidence can't be facts. I travel regularly, and atleast for me, nothing has changed, infact, things have gotten worse.

I ordered a burger through their app with Burger King. But got delivered a burger from a faker restaurant ""Burger Kings"". Swiggy support over phone said to me ""Sir we can deliver food from the restaurant you order."" I'm pissed. I took it up in twitter and alerted Swiggy and Burger King. Swiggy escalation team calls me and offers me an option of refund of money or a coupon. I'm yet to receive either. Now there is only deafening silence.

I'm putting up this post to warn you people, that if you use Swiggy, please be careful. Please see the images that I've posted. The sad part is their escalation team accepted that there is a mistake and yet they don't care that they need to refund the money. Please see the pictures below that tell the story.

[But I got burger from fake restaurant Burger Kings](https://i.redd.it/y97ineslmmj31.jpg)",lsjey," So, you (or your mother) ordered from ""Burger Kings"" from the app and Swiggy delivered. What am I missing?

Did you order from Burger King and Swiggy switched the order? The images are ambiguous. Does burger king even give samosa? I once accidentally ordered from burger Singh instead of Burger King.  





Burger King lost a customer from that day. Lol. Another ignorant post from someone who doesn't know how food delivery and aggregator app works. 

You got the food from where you ordered. Swiggy didn't ""sell"" you anything from ""fake"" place. 

Swiggy isn't at fault here, they will list anyone which legit restaurant.  And it seems Burger Kings is legit. 

The people running burger kings are at fault here. They just gamed the system but it is upto Burger King to protect their trademark and not swiggy's.

Open a restaurant named Pizza Huts all you want, it's only pizza hut's problem and no one else. 

Google about Starbucks and SardarBaksh. That Murugan Idly logo tho....

DAE see what I see? Swiggy and zomato have both become massively shiet..... 

Wherever I open the app it says 25 minutes, as soon as I place the order it says 35..... I'm lucky if the order comes in 45

Zomato being far worse has kept me waiting for 90 minutes with their constant useless update ""saaar your order is on it's way and arriving shortly"" You didn‚Äôt miss anything. Why anyone would eat the crap served by Burger King, kfc and other chutiya chains while there are hundreds of alternatives is beyond me. The real question is, how was the burger? Go for Truffles ""All American Burgers"" with Lemon Iced tea. It's a treat to have it every weekend for me.",2019-08-31 07:39:59
Food,The restaurant I went to in Kerala has paper straws,67,csgimn,https://i.redd.it/7pqhk4liheh31.jpg,55,,rosesan," I thought it was a pretty normal thing now. Most of Bangalore eateries have this. I rarely see plastic straws these days. KFC, Taco Bell etc in Delhi have started using paper straws. McDonalds have gone 1 step ahead and stopped giving straws altogether. OP has been dining under a rock so far. I had these in Mumbai as well but they don't really last long. Must be soiling after a few minutes. I have seen that in quite a few restaurants/movie theatres in Kolkata.

But they are not a very good idea at all, as they don't last very long! Especially when you are watching a movie, and sipping your Coke slowly for 2 hours... after about half an hour the paper straw starts disintegrating, and it doesn't work any more! I generally asked for 3 or 4 straws and kept replacing them after 15-20 minutes. That's why a lot of places have stopped using them, since customers complained. Same in Navi Mumbai. Lot of restaurants now do that. Even in Mumbai. I got a shocked reaction from shop keeper when I asked for Plastic straws. He told only paper straws. Rs. 2 for each. Hello caveman! Is that beer ? You having beer with a straw ? Kolkata KFC has also started using paper straws. They may be bio degradable but I dont think they are recyclable.A step in the right direction, for now Ginger lemonade? Haldiram also gives biodegradable plates and straws Many restaurants in Gurgaon do that brah Single use plastic is banned in most states. Literally everywhere in Delhi I was in Pondicherry last week, all restaurants I visited had paper straws, including the ones at airport. That drink doesn't even need a straw? They were being used in Pune too in many shops. Lensing them in the drink for a minute rendered them useless. There's a resort in Bangalore that has Bamboo straws Drink fast op, they get sogggy They have been used for quite a while in my state. Not sure where OP is from where this isn‚Äôt normal. They are only okay-ish though and works well for juices but thick shakes are a different matter. Good for the environment though. Disgusting bg. Say whatever.",2019-08-20 02:08:28

Food,What kind of lifestyle could one live with 35k pm in Bangalore?,54,cwvmvg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cwvmvg/what_kind_of_lifestyle_could_one_live_with_35k_pm/,31,"Any rough outline from people who are living there?

Age 23, bachelor, moving there soon. 

I'd be happy with a private room to sleep but I'm not sure if that's feasible. I don't need to send anything back home. How much can I save, if any? 

I should be getting about 35k in hand

Would appreciate responses from people living there. Thanks!",twinklex," 35K is good amount to live in bangalore and can save much as well.

1. Bachelor - look out for PG which allows to prepare food of your own (5K to 7K max) based on your work location.

2. Purchase rice cooker with extra bowl

3. Prepare your own food

4. Avoid malls as much as possible. Once in 2 months is better

5. If you booze, bring it your room and have it rather than going to pubs.

6. Do not buy unnecessary gadgets.

7. Most important open ppf account + auto schedule savings so that you won't be spending much.

8. If you love traveling, use trains which is lot cheaper way

I lived in bangalore for 4 years with 30k as my salary For a simple lifestyle: home cooked meals, taking buses/metro for travel, not going out much, renting a room, ‚Çπ35k should let you live comfortably and save some too.

For a more lavish lifestyle, going out for food/drinks often, taking cabs/autos for travel, renting a single BHK(in a good part of the city), ‚Çπ35k can become 0 very soon in a month.

So based on your habits, one can either make it or break in Bangalore. Post in r/Bangalore I haven‚Äôt lived in Bangalore for a few years now but my guess is that if you look hard enough you may get a decent single room for ~ Rs 10 - 15k. You can stay in a PG which even served food for much cheaper.       

Obviously there‚Äôs no limit to how much you can spend .. even 1 lakh per month if you go out just in weekends to fancy pubs and bars but if you cook at home, and go out occasionally you can live decently. General Rule - Don't spend more than 25% of your salary on rent.  Which means 8.75k. 

Save before you spend. Open a separate account and park money there as savings. Don't touch this money except in case of emergencies. I strongly suggest saving 25% of your salary. Since you are quite young. You can just go for liquidity and not invest anything for at max 2 years ( But I seriously suggest investing as soon as you can).

Make your own food. Cooking is a skill which every person should have. Yes it might be convenient to hire a cook/ tiffin service, but none will match the hygiene and nutrition of dishes you can make yourself. Food deliveries should be reserved for special occasions or once in a while lazy nights. 

Drinking/Dining out  is very  expensive. Should be a bi-monthly affair at the most. Travelling expense will depend on the location of your room and office. But who are we kidding this is banglore will be a 1hr affair at the very least. I hope metro's service has improved since I was last there. For a long commute bus/metro is the only option. For a short commute you'd be much better buying an old 2-wheeler.   


In an ideal world. 

25% - Rent

25% - Savings

25% - Living Expense( Groceries, Travelling, Bills)

25% - Investment. This is about my friend. He stays in a 2bhk high profile apartment with his friend at Domlur near Indira Nagar. So he gets a bedroom, bathroom and balcony whole for himself. Monthly rent is 28k. They share, so he pays 14k per month. They have a gym in the club facility in apartment.

They hire a domestic help who comes daily and clean the house including bathroom. Monthly expenditure for that is 2000. They hire a cook who come daily morning and evening and cook for three times a day. Her payment is 5000 per month. The average amount for groceries a month is Rs 5000. Since they divde this, each person spends 6000.

His office is just nearby, so he walks daily. If at all he can't monthly travel expenditure would come maximum 2000. Internet and electricity would come upto 1000 per person.

These are his bare minimum expenditure. Considering your case, I can say you will have 12k at hand after spending so much and living luxuriously. With that you can eat out, travel, party or save. Solo 1bhk-2bhk Rent : 12-15k

Maid(s) : 5k

Internet, Mobile, Electricity, Cable : 3k

Groceries for one person : 5k

&#x200B;

That leaves you with about 7k pm. I am assuming you are to commute by office shuttles/cabs and for other travelling even if you use Ola/Uber, an average of 4 trips per week at about 150/- it comes to about 2.5k for commuting.

That still leaves you with 4.5k to splurge on entertainment - movies, meals, shopping etc

Not much left, but then this is the cost of comfortable living, you could choose to go the PG route or share an apartment with friends and save on rent, maid, groceries etc. To be true, it depends on how  frugally you can live.

The rent can be anywhere from 7k to 15k.  

Food depends on you, are you good with skipping the dinner and having milk and fruits, thus saving some money and keeping your systems in check.

Have a heavy lunch, that too depends on where your job is, is the company providing meals or you have to uber or zomato the meal.  

Commute can be anywhere from ‚Çπ10 in a local bus to ‚Çπ70 for an Uber auto for the same distance. I'm spending about 25k for expenses monthly. That too, I'm living a pretty luxurious lifestyle. I think 35k is good enough for a bachelor Just above bare minimum.",2019-08-29 17:21:24

It's one of the best drinks I have ever had and I found out that a few friends of mine don't even know about it. Anything in Kochi ? Moving to Pune soon, will be living near yerwada/vishrant wadi.

Those people seems to be super calm and unfazed considering the water force and the whole situation. Water water everywhere, not any drop to drink. This city has the most useless water sewer system.

Edit: Its mine city. Anyone else immediately thinks of desert after hearing Rajasthan? [deleted] Don't drink this water guys, it will make you Sicker. But shops are still open. get dem surfboards out Fuck! That's my city! Well shit. Climate change is for real. Whilst not many people paid attention to it with its onset, but come natural disasters and tons of other problems, people are all in words and concern for their mother nature!

Following the same concern, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change urged its member nations to shoulder an equity-based share of adaptive and mitigation responsibilities to overcome the threatening crisis. The conference of parties unveiled some possible impacts of this change and they are far more bleaker than you could ever imagine.

As for developing countries like India, these effects are even more scary.

As for India, a nation whose GDP depends heavily on agriculture; the expected mean rise of 3¬∫C temperature by the end of the century, irregularity in rainfall, rise in sea levels posing risk of submergence to the coastal cities of Mumbai and Chennai and more frequent and destructive coastal storms are just some of the threats that would haunt the spirits of its inhabitants.

Among the many consequences of these which include, rising sea levels and a constant threat of irregular climate disasters like the ones in Uttarakhand and Chennai in the recent years; there‚Äôs something far worse.

India is a country of 1.2 billion people! Now with such a vast and ever-increasing population, we consume grains in bulk, whose production exactly is predicted to fall in the forthcoming years.

Read: Climate Change: Why We Must Be Worried More Than Ever Before - antWHIRL

A study by Dasgupta, 2013 projects an overall decline in food grain production by 18 per cent within the next 30 years! Such a downfall in the production of food grains can be directly related to the deterioration of Indian economy, given the huge dependence on agriculture both economically and socially.

So, in short; Climate change if not battled would bring in not only occasional misery with various disasters, it would sweetly serve us with the menace of prolonged starvation and unemployment!

So, what is India planning to do?

Rape the child, blame the muslim, protect the cow.

Oh and build statues to characters from fables.

What should you do? Ignore the naysayers and GTFO out of India ASAP. That guy is so happy, he got a water park right in front of his house I like how people in the video don‚Äôt give a fuck at all!

Food,Anyone else noticed the dip in quality of local restaurants after Swiggy/Zomato blew up?,292,cm4btg,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cm4btg/anyone_else_noticed_the_dip_in_quality_of_local/,43,"It like they no longer give a fuck about people who eat at restaurants instead of ordering.

At least two of my regular places have went to shit after Swiggy bullshit took over.

Dine in area basically feels like extended kitchen. Employees randomly packing orders wherever they want. No proper fans or lighting. 

Other suspicious things like selling tandoori chicken and shawarma when both of equipment clearly hasn't been used for some time.

They used to have hot tandoor baking fresh chicken one side and fresh shawarma on another throughout the day.

Now they probably just make it in bulk, then heat it up whenever ordered.

I also noticed a dip in proper manner/courtesy. Dine in customers are probably no longer their primary customers and they treat you like that. 

Then there is also the repulsive business model of companies involved.

Honestly someone should start a trend of ""This hotel/restaurants does not take orders from Swiggy/Zomato"" places. Like those ""Veg only"" places.",Poo_C," That may be true but did anyone notice quality of Swiggy plummeting down. New delivery boys who don't even know how to use the app navigation and rude behaviour. Nothing ever happens even if you complain so they just keep getting ruder every month. You regular the wrong places I guess. The places I regular are still fine except that service takes a bit longer than usual as online orders get priority. But since I mostly am out with my family I do not mind. 

I have a couple of places near me who do not take orders from swiggy/ zomato. they are good too, but take a similar time in serving. Again the delay does not bug me, so alls good. They are getting paid 50-60 bucks(30% commission + 30-50% discount + returns, cancellation and scams) for a 200 rs tandoori chicken by the swamato due to the competition, fomo and monopoly in the market. Dude always remember that if you are eating out or ordering food you are eating extremely unhygienic food. My friend who is now chef at third restaurant has seen some shit. He never eats out. No matter from where you order. Shit has got the fan since order delivery services came. Because customer is not even at restaurant to see if quality of kitchen is up to standard or not. That was just a one time experience for me. There's a pizza outlet where I went to. The times when I had food at their place, It was amazing. When I ordered through swiggy, it sucked badly Not sure about dining in, but I have definitively noticed a dip in quality in the food since zomato/swiggy have become mainstream.

Earlier, all the curries used to have their unique flavor and taste. Now it feels like they just have one big tub of curry and they just add the stuff you've ordered. So mushroom masala tastes EXACTLY the same as Butter Paneer masala, just with Paneer instead of Mushroom. 

Even the most premium restaurant available on these platforms in my area has same tasting food whenever you order. It's slowly getting so annoying that my lazy ass rather prefer to cook my food myself Looks like Swiggy/Uber bullshit has hit both the restaurant business and the delivery business equally well. 

1. A friend got his food delivered in a la carte style : A Swiggy delivery executive shows up, puts his hand into the cloth bag which the restaurant gave, proceeds to hand my friend the items that were in it and leaves with the cloth bag.

2. Uber executive calls my friend, tells her that he cannot find her house because his GPRS(?) is not working. She helps him navigate, and while at it, he runs out of petrol. At this point, he is 200m away from her place. He keeps saying random stuff and pretends as though he is not understanding where he is. He refuses to ask the people passing by, for help. At the end he abuses her and asks here to come to him to get the food. Uber refused to refund her the money, stating the reason as ""unable to contact the customer"". Yeah. Remember going to a Punjabi restaurant in Bandra since 2007. Visited there this year after a gap of four years and it has actually way worse off than before. Food seemed hastily cooked and the waiters just literally wanted you the eat and gtfo and there was a line of delivery guys outside. [deleted] The good restaurants I like don't do online delivery in the first place That is true .. reason behind is earlier, business was simple .. the raw material and prepration cost was needed to be calculated with price to get an idea of decent profit .. now swiggy etc take away nearly 28 %  off per order so they have to adjust the quality and quantity to maintain the same profit.   Eventually they apply same formula all across.   Basically what they're doing is scrapping off the gone 28% from regular direct customers .. so quality has been degraded all over .. Where I stay, good quality restaurants prefer to 'switch off' Swiggy/Zomato/etc. whenever there is heavy load. They are just not listed on Swiggy at that particular time. They prefer to serve their dine-in customers first.

Also, in situations like now the rainy season, Swiggy gives the order to the restaurant, but is unable to find the delivery executive at the right time, leading to cancellation of orders due to very long delay times. This causes a loss for everyone. I have seen lots of conversations on restauranteur groups where the owners are cribbing about the tight corners caused by these services. Have seen sizeable reduction in dining area in few of the hotels nearby here in Bangalore A restaurant near me has the opposite situation. When i ate the food there it felt more fresh compared to orders plus the quantity was more too, they were also offering discounts for dining there and takeouts.

Though this varies from restaurant to restaurant. True for a lot of places, Multiple factors to it. 
1. Scale - Earlier a restaurant was service a fixed number of meals at any given time depending on their seating and popularity of take aways. Now the same kitchen is also service a much larger number of online orders, quality is going to take a hit with this increase in volume.
2. Margins - with the delivery apps taking a large cut as commission the margins are lower, restaurants have to cut down costs to get similar profit.
3. Focus - Earlier restaurant business was driven by ensuring customers come back because the Customer base was smaller. Food needs to be good, ambience need to be good, prices should be right, otherwise the customer is not coming back and you are losing business. With online deliveries driving a larger portion of revenue they don't care much. Also, unlike dining out, which is an experience thing, ordering from home is more of a convenience thing. Nah.
I don't think the quality has worsened noticably.

I don't order a whole lot but the places I order from I used to frequent before. I don't see a change in flavour or quality. Maybe it's just the places I order and not a large sample size. I had the same thought !! 
Restaurants are not giving a single fuck about the taste , they're just selling food to fill the stomach. No regards are given to the taste Also seen a major price hike in many places. A local sandwich shop used to give a pizza sandwich for 50. Now it's 120. I guess the publicity from Swiggy increased the demand to an extent that they found it necessary to hike their prices by over a 100%. My place there is no swiggy but the restuarants are top class. I have never ordered food via Zomato/swiggy and i will never do. They're changing how you eat, outsourcing cooking. One of many perks of living in India is that food is cheap if you cook yourself. Now this is gone too, now a big chunk of your paycheck is going into buying cooked food. 

I cook my own food and I'll continue to do this. Occasionally i go eat out in a fancy restaurant because i like this experience. That's it. This ordering food lifestyle may suit Americans but it'll certainly not suit Indians in the long run. Wake up.",2019-08-05 14:42:56
Food,"Indians who've been to other countries: How would you describe the taste of food at other places like Italy, China, USA, etc. Did you have problems adjusting to their food or was it different but good?",22,cec6vt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cec6vt/indians_whove_been_to_other_countries_how_would/,19,"I see food vloggers and tv shows talking about food from other places but I wonder how it tastes when the food is cooked without spices and marinates and seasoned very lightly with nothing more than salt,pepper and raw herbs. 

Was it easy for you to adjust according to the food preferences prevalent in these places or did you have to find indian restaurants or cook your own food to feel satisfied.  

My main question is wether a person, who has eaten authentic north Indian food all his life , can enjoy dishes made with minimal seasoning and completely different cooking styles?",MGsquare," From my experience I can talk about Italy.

Italian food focuses on fresh and high quality ingredients. A lot of dishes are created with few and relatively simple ingredients. Some things that are commonly eaten: Salad with only olive oil and balsamic vinegar or even bread with olive oil and salt. If you can do it with extra virgin olive oil, even better.

The food in general in Italy is amazing where ever you go, every region has its own version of the same dish. You have to get used to it though. At the beginning it might seem bland, but slowly you start tasting individual ingredients and it gets better then.

Indian restaurants here are not so good. So every time I feel like eating something spicy I eat a pizza/pasta with nduja (spicy pork) or just manage to cook something at home. US - I've been to Texas. The local food here is mostly Tex-Mex or Mexican and it isn't really far off from Indian spicy food. The other american food suggested by the people were mostly what you consider junk food here - pizza, burgers. Then there are english breakfast stuff - bacon, sausage, pancakes etc. In my two weeks there, I did not go to any Indian restaurants or homes of any Indians and I didn't miss the Indian food at all. In fact, it felt like I was in India but eating only restaurant food and non Indian cuisine.  
  
UK - Again 2 weeks in London. The breakfast options are the same as what you get here, but apart from that it's all fish and chips. Every other english food item (except dessert) I tried was plain bland. But London being a big city and all options available, I tried other cuisines and so I could manage. Also, pizza and burgers are readily available. I didn't go to any Indian places though. If I had to go to some small town where there aren't any Indian/Asian/Mexican restaurants, it would've been a struggle. Fish and chips would be available, but the fish is like boiled fish.  Also, london is expensive as fuck. Never going there again unless someone else pays my bills. Recently ate Singaporean stuff like laksa along with some Japanese stuff.its tolerable but yeah your spice intake will be reduced compared to Indian ones. Indonesian food is also very rich in spices. Even the fried rice is excellent. Try googling for Nasi Gudeg, Egg Balado, Sate with peanut sauce, Soto Ayam, Ikam Bakar Kecap Manis. Usually they also serve sambals, which are kind if like chutneys, but I like them more. I stead of pappadums, they have krupuk, of which krupuk udang( shrimp crackers) is my favourite. A good Kang Kung hitokaye or some capcay make good vegetables. Generally, Indonesian food is great, but the dessert scene is still lacking compared to India. 

Vietnamese Pho is something I truly enjoy. It has all the delicacy of Ramen, with less salt and more lemongrass. I liked it the moment I smelled it. 

American food was honestly a bit disappointing for me. Most of it was just uncooked salad or grilled steaks, hamburgers etc. or stuff like Mac n Cheese which I dislike. Food from Louisiana, especially Cajun and Creole dishes were very enjoyable though. I suspect there is a lot left I haven‚Äôt experienced. 

Caribbean food is delicious, but a bit limited in range. It can be just as spicy as Indian food, but it feels more wholesome. Jerk chicken is a dream. Food from South America, especially tacos and burritos and salsa were also to my taste, and they are very popular in the US. Cuban food is great. I wish our lentil curries tasted that good. 

British food was disappointing. Fish n Chips were ok at best. Generally I found they dishes from the rest of Europe was commonly found in the UK. Hungarian Goulash tasted good. The Brits are fairly good at baked desserts though, especially cakes and puddings. Sticky toffee pudding is good. 

I dislike almost all Chinese food I have tried save a few Sichuan dishes, mainly Mapo Tofu, Twice cooked pork, meatballs, cooked duck and some dim sum. Honestly the smell itself is sometimes a problem. Maybe, as you ask, if I tried going to China, I might change my opinion. I went to US an tried their food.It's not  with spices like ours. I can describe it as raw. Most westerners eat their food raw. The sweets are pretty good.  If you go to the restaurants you will be surprised as you pay lot of money for little food. At the end of the day there's nothing good as our own Indian style Living in US and been to Italy, France, Belgium and Netherlands.

US: You get everything here, by everything I dont mean Indian. I mean it taste wise. If you open up to eating all sorts of meats, then you have ample choice of good spicy cuisines. Mexican and Thai food can surprise you with the kind of spices they used, they are super hot (In US Hot is Teekha not garam). 

Italy: They know how to use spices, but not salt, if you add a little bit of salt to the dishes you are fine and I loved the food. Especially try their coastal food its Yum!

France: I only liked the bakery items, not that the food is bad, but ordering the right thing may take some efforts as they are not very friendly with English. However I must agree they use a very little to no exotic spices. Blant very blant food. 

Belgium: Again since they have a heavy influence of France, there food is similar but they have some good dishes which an Indian would love for the spices (again need to be open for many meat choices ).

Netherlands: Lovely culture and food and you can easily love their food being from any part of the planet. Burgers, sandwiches and salads mainly but super tasty.

&#x200B;

All I would say is  open up to all the choices, food is food ! And there are passionate people making it, keep your beliefs aside and try it! Canada -

There is plenty of Indian food here, Toronto has a huge Indian population and you will be easily accommodated. Even in smaller cities, there are still plenty of Immigrants pretty much wherever you go. Man, get out of your comfort zone. I presume you are still in your 20s. This is the best time to move around. Once you are married there are a bunch load of problems moving around. Why don't you go aboard? Apply for a Phd or something?

I find it extremely depressing that there are people who have not got out of their city or their state.",2019-07-18 01:59:20

Inspite of making no strict dietary changes his blood sugar was normal for almost those entire period except for the last 1 year. I want him to make healthy & better choices from now on but could not find huge variety of indian foods suitable for an diabetic which also meet his daily calorie intake. Pls suggest foods that you know of. Thank you.

My findings till now: egg, milk, lean meat, fish, veggies, chickpeas, soya products,nuts, beans",Geno_and_Pheno," Dad had diabetes. What helped him was exercise. One hour of exercise everyday. Do add that to the list. I have a slightly different question. My dad(and his sister and his dad) has diabetes(Type 2, detected after 45). My mom doesn't have diabetes but her mother(my grandma) had it. Therefore, my genes are full of diabetic dispositions. How do I minimize my chances of getting afflicted with diabetes? The amount of misinformation spread in this thread regarding diabetes amazes me. Please don't treat diabetes as a causal condition. It is indeed life altering. If you are in big city, get a diet chart from dietitian. I'm in the same boat basically. My mom and dad both had diabetes and I'm on a high risk as well. 

Well I'll tell you some stuff. This advice goes to anyone looking to live a healthy lifestyle and avoiding diabetes.

1) Do Intermittent fasting. Watch Dr Eric Berg's videos on YouTube on that topic. Basically what you wanna do is keep the insulin levels as low as possible to avoid being insulin resistant which leads to diabetes. Plus IF has numerous benefits.

2) Exercise is the best medicine. Doesn't matter what kind. No brainer.

3) Sugar is evil, I don't eat even a tiny bit. Sugar doesn't mean only sugary stuff it also means things high in carbs/glucose (rice). Search about glycemic index and why it's important. So eat right. Search ketogenic diet.

4) Keeping stress levels low, stress is related to all kinds of illnesses. 

5) Related to point number 1, don't eat too frequently in a day. Every time you eat you spike up your insulin levels and it's bad if your insulin spikes regularly causing insulin resistance so try eating twice a day. I eat twice a day once at 12pm and at 8pm followed by 16 hours of fasting. I've lost most of my belly fat, corrected my insulin resistance and I haven't felt so much better in a long time, all my symptoms of pre diabetes are gone. 


Intermittent fasting doesn't mean that you're 'fasting'. You can still eat any amount of food you want but only in a given time window. 

Research about these things and good luck! r/desiketo My father was diagnosed with diabetes at age 46 and exercise was the miracle cure for him. His diabetes was still in early stages when I made him join a gym and quit all sugary/junk food. In 6 months his sugar levels went from 600 to 90 and that level's been consistent even after 2 years. I guess what helped him the most was that we started early and didn't let it get worse. 

Even tho his sugar levels are not high anymore, we still don't allow him sugar. For tea he only drinks green tea or black tea, we don't add too much ghee or butter to his diet because of high carbs, no more junk food and regular exercise. Altho you need to find what works the best for your father because everyone's different. Check out intermittent fasting. I've read it can reverse even type 2 diabetes.

Google about it and read more on its sub - r/intermittentfasting My father had diabetes since his early 40s and was able to keep it under control till his legs began to trouble him in his late 70s. He walked for 45mins every day whether it rained or it was freezing. Also he followed a strict diet of no sugar, no potatoes and very small amount of rice. Exercise and diet control is only help. [deleted] Stop eating carbs and it should all be fine My mom and dad both have diabetes and after the changes they made they feel younger, fitter, and healthier than ever. 

1. Exercise. Daily exercise is extremely important. Minimum 1hr everyday. Brisk walk is good. 

2. Diet. I can't comment about non-veg food because we are vegetarians but they made 2 massive changes. Learn that everything white is poison. Cut out white rice, wheat, sugar and salt. They replaced it with Millets. So they now make Jowar/Bajra Rotis or instead of wheat rotis, and use Millet rice instead of white rice. [The Millet Table](https://www.millettable.com) has a lot of recipes to teach you how to use millets. 

3. Don't abandon sweets or you'll have cravings you'll give in to it and gorge on it. The best diet is the one you can maintain. So make sweets ocassionally but slowly reduce sugar and substitute with Palm Sugar, jaggery, etc. 

Ear more vegetables. So make 2 sabjis everyday instead of one. Fill up using vegetables instead of carbs Loosing weight is must. Find the ideal BMI for his age group and stay close to it. Belly fat is most dangerous. Being diabetic means excess pressure on kidneys and liver which can also affect the heart. Processed foods are a no go. Find a meal plan and stick to it. No cheat days. Prepare your meals early if you know there are going to be plans. Strict regiment diet and exercise is the key, nothing else. I wouldn't recommend a very low carb diet as our body needs energy to function. Just find healthier alternatives. Any product with low ' glycemic index ' will work(GI around 55). [Have a look](http://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/food/what-can-i-eat/understanding-carbohydrates/glycemic-index-and-diabetes.html).

Some examples-Jwar,Bajra,Oatmeal. Type 2 Diabetic here. Went from 126 mg/mL to 93 mg/mL sugar levels in 3 months.

In veggies choose vegetables that your father can eat without getting gassy. 

Soya products totally out.

Milk totally out. 

Meat doesn't need to be and shouldn't be lean. Use fatty cuts. 

Remove beans completely if it makes your father gassy. 

Look more for portion control and carb quality than choosing the carb content.

Ten minute walk after each meal. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. 

2 eggs a day. The choline in egg yolks will help control blood sugar.

Supplement vitamin D3. Do LowCarb.

If he's T2D consider Keto. Follow youtube channels like eric berg and beat diabetes. Overtime if you do not make dietary changes the baseline sugar level increases making it difficult to control blood sugar. At his age their needs to be a strict monitoring of carbohydrate consumption otherwise complications can arise Might wanna try intermittent fasting or low carb diets. Do your research before Please please please spend time researching what I'm saying below. 

This stuff really works.

Get the book called The Diabetes Code by Dr. Jason Fung.

Immediately cut out soy products, LEAN meat.

Remove all vegetable/seed oils - sunflower oil, canola oil, etc. (all omega-6 rich, which is bad).

Only oil that's suitable for India, mostly - unrefined coconut oil (omega-3 rich).

Exercise WILL NOT CURE AILMENTS. It's good to generally exercise but it isn't a cure to anything, not even weight loss.

Check out Jackfruit 365 products on Amazon or their videos on YouTube.

As much as the world of medicine would like you to believe it's a persistent, chronic, worsening disease, IT ISN'T! I am not an expert here, but oatmeal is also good for diabetes. Just don‚Äôt go for masala or any spiced oats. 
Just plain and simple oat is good. You DM me.

yaad se. Basically anything that is keto friendly will keep his diabetes under control. My mom could go off her diabetes meds following keto. But she had to start taking them after she stopped following it. Do mind this is for type 2 diabetes. It's lethal for someone with type 1 diabetes. About food, best is javaari ki roti. Sabji must not be too spicy and must have good water content. Less sugar. My father too has diabetes but is in control. And regular exercise is a must Cut down sugar and alcohol. Also track calories (eg. with myfitnesspal) and avoid overeating. For your dad 2000 calories per day should be plenty.",2019-06-08 20:02:27
Food,How to solve stray dog/cattle problem in Indian cities?,20,cy8tlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cy8tlf/how_to_solve_stray_dogcattle_problem_in_indian/,22,"If I'm not wrong, many cities see multiple traumatic injuries, accidents and even deaths every day due to this menace.

The problem of stray dogs is mostly that of breeding and garbage, both seem very hard to solve if left to the government.  Is it even practical to sterilize all stray dogs?

The problem of stray cattle is mostly due to old cattle being an economic burden but not led to a butcher house because of cultural and legal issues around cows. There are rarely any stray buffaloes. 

Has there been any debate in any significant municipal, state or central forum?",drollbat," Sterilization would be the most humane method but I've personally witnessed the incompetency of officials in this regard.The one other viable option would me mass euthanasia, which won't sit well with a large percentage of the population. Any debate and it will be immediately quashed by the animal lovers. Make India like Texas I strongly agree with you. But as the others have pointed out animal lovers will quash any debate on this topic.

Its lunacy to the max. I think India is the only country I have been to where animals are treated so poorly in the name of protecting/loving them. Would there be lots of rats if there were no dogs? Everybody has spoken about dogs let's talk about cattle. 

Dogs need to be sterilized period.

I being a vegan studied a bit on this subject. Dairy farmers sometimes have no clue what to do with infertile or males cattle so they just leave them on streets. Since nobody can trace which dairy farmer left his cattle behind they run scot free. 


And please stop being jerks and treating cows like use and throw material. Its humans greed which leads to animal factory farming for no reason. Just because cows can't talk and hire lawyer people think its okay to slaughter them. 

The biggest problem is humans who create trash. They could minimize trash but no they have to use and throw cups, order food then waste the same food take everything for granted and then blame poor animals which are doing their best for survival. the gun laws here make it worse.",2019-09-02 00:57:24
Food,Who do you think is right in #LogOut campaign? Zomato or Restaurant owners?,26,cuouln,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cuouln/who_do_you_think_is_right_in_logout_campaign/,39,"The #LogOut campaign has been raising eyebrows as the uprising of restaurants against food aggregators who are technically not bound by what restaurants on their platforms say. More on the campaign [here](https://www.livemint.com/news/india/restaurants-decide-to-pull-out-of-dining-apps-that-offer-deals-1565792728714.html)

So for those who haven't heard about it, the restaurants via their association ""National Restaurants Association of India""(NRAI) have broadly faced following issues.

1) The zomato gold deep discounting system is hurting their business since people misuse it by for example, on a weekend, get 1+1 on drinks at one place and then grab 1+1 on food at another place. This unarguably has hut the owner's pockets

2) Lack of transparency from Zomato on their rating system and the fact that Zomato provide details of customers using which Restaurants can build a loyal customer base.

3) Large chains like Domino's and McD are able to negotiate huge bargain on commissions(7-8%) while small restaurants have to agree to around 20-25% to even be visible on the platform. This doesn't include the hefty advertising fee. Hence, no uniform policy and systematic abuse of MSME eateries.

Now, these may seem like business decisions on part of Zomato to become profitable. Still, they have agreed to tweak Gold program, rather unfairly to us as customers. More on that [here](https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/zomato-rejigs-gold-service-to-benefit-restaurants-ceo-1566402560626.html)

Yesterday, Zomato Co-founder and CEO engaged in below the belt fights and said they were done with this campaign.

So, who do you think is right in their stand?

Edit: My apologies I wont be able to reply anyone on here since I've been banned, but thanks for having the convo!",deludedDudes," When Zomato Gold was introduced, participating restaurants were told it would be an exclusive platform for a select few to grow their footfall. In about 6 months that changed and now any Tom, Dick & Harry can sign up. They also changed the rules for customers who signed up for unlimited unlocks, but are now limited to 1 a day. Amidst this fiasco, they've also increased the membership price of Gold by 50%.

Zomato charges the merchant 20k per annum, and the customer 1,800 per annum in return for what? For a separate list in the app and minor tweaks where you get a Gold logo. No part of the kitty is given to the merchant, who is paying Zomato to join what used to be an exclusive club _and_ giving away freebies.

IMHO one of the real scoundrels here that's getting away is Swiggy. Swiggy has been running discount campaigns for several months in India under the moniker ""Swiggy It"". The customer gets a 30-60% discount on every order, for which the restaurant is charged a flat fee. What customers don't realise is that the flat fee is often times more than the discount that they're receiving. Let me give you an example:

I run a cloud kitchen that was offering a 20% discount on all orders with no max discount (aka discount cap). So if a customer ordered worth 1k, they'd receive a discount of Rs 200 and both parties were happy since the order value went up proportionately to the discount.

Then came their predatory ""swiggyit"" campaign, where my restaurant had to pay Rs 87 + tax for the customer to get a discount worth (upto) Rs 100. The tax is now being paid because Swiggy has positioned the discount as a ""growth pack"" and restaurants are technically purchasing a product from Swiggy for every order. So 87 + 18% GST is about Rs 103. And at the end of it, the customer's discount is capped at Rs 100, and many times he doesn't even receive the full cap value of the discount because it's a percentage of the order total.

The real clincher is that an order would have to be worth Rs 500 if the customer was to receive a discount of Rs 100 under our old promotion. Instead, now the customer gets a lower discount and we get charged more for every single order than the customer will ever receive in discount value.

Oh, and Swiggy can claim the 18% GST in input tax credit whereas restaurants can't.

If you don't sign up for this discount campaign, you get pushed so far down in the listings that nobody will ever see you, seriously maiming visibility and discoverability.

For anyone defending Zomato or Swiggy or UberEats, I invite you to try running a restaurant. In fact, try running even a delivery kitchen, which involves lesser startup costs, operational overheads, and is overall a leaner outfit. It's not as easy as it looks from the outside. If restros cant shy away from pricing a humble neebupani at 150, paratha at 100+. I stand with zomato. ""Food doesn't have a religion. It is a *business*."" Schemes like Zomato Gold were never going to be sustainable in a low trust society like India Amazon is coming Bois... Who does Zomato Gold and Infinity and other things benefit?  
  
- Users - Discounts. More food for lesser money.  
  
- Zomato - Money from users, commission from the restaurants per order  
  
- Restaurants - More customers, but losses per customer per order.   
  
What am I missing? If nothing, there's no reason why Restaurants should be on/with zomato. Related link:
https://theprint.in/economy/how-zomato-went-from-food-industry-fairytale-to-evil-corporation/279592/ i remember posting a big post here almost everyone thought i was overreacting today how the tables have turned 

so lets analyze whats wrong 

1) ***deep discounts*** of which the restaurant bares 35-40 percent and the company the rest the problem is if you order worth 300 and give a discount of even 30 percent the restaurant pays 90 rupees and the company caps the discount at 90 so they didn't end up paying the rest of the percentage the customer would not care if he didnt get the 10 rupppes lesser since he already got 90 rupees off 

***2) no self delivery-*** the company no longer allows self delivery the percentage charged for my outlet is 17 because i signed it a while ago today they dont wanna take on anyone for lesser than 30 percent per order . At least let us deliver our food so that our commissions can be less 

***3)zom gold*** \- recently a friend took us to a pub and for 4 beers we payed 600 which is ridiculous had i bought it from the wine shop it would have cost me 500 how will you as a person run your pub on 100 rupees ? im not mentioning the sign up fees etc 

***4) bad service -*** never in all these years did we face a problem of delivery boys eating the customers food . even when a order is cancelled i never receive  my food back . account managers not answering calls going on random vacations and the service center is just abysmal 

&#x200B;

overall zomato needs to behave I personally think this is a healthy campaign. The Food Aggregator Apps are still at a nascent stage. And we all know how startups can be aggressive for them to be to be successful. So right now, they are probably bullying the restaurants. And now these restaurant associations have woken up and fighting back. This is nothing but market forces at play. Soon, the market would mature and all the stakeholders would reach a point of understanding where everyone gets benefited. These are natural events in a free market and let's not paint someone bad or good here.",2019-08-24 17:49:17

Do try the apple pie there.

Then there's JHV mall and the restaurants there.

The Kebab Factory in Radisson.

Benares Club has okay food. If you are near Lanka(BHU) area, go to Ravidas Gate and ask for Pehelwan Shop for some authentic lassi. There are 4(3+1) shops there by the same name. Choose the 1 shop. You'll know which is the (1) I am talking about. It will cost you about 40-50 for the large cup. 

Near the Ravidas Gate, ask for 'Keshav Tambol Bhandar'. It is hardly 40-50 m from Pehelwan. Have some really nice meetha paan costing about 20. Enjoy the moment when it melts inside your mouth.

Just opposote to (3)Pehelwans, there is a small sweetshop. Not in the best condition, but it serves a really nice and sweet 'Launglatta'. If you have trouble finding it, ask someone for Khandelwal Vastralay. The sweetshop is just opposite to it.

Between the stretch of road which connects Ravidas Gate and BHU gate, there is a food truck that serves some really nice Faluda and  ice cream. In the same street, there is a small and dilapidated coffee shop which serces you coffee in a kulhad for Rs. 20. I always have it when I am in that area.

All of these things are within 100-200 m of each other and can be done inside of an hour.",2019-08-22 01:57:33

Like having food in dhabas for months? I am bit skeptic about it.

I am not gonna spend more than Rs 100 per day on food. Water can be managed by refilling from restaurants or something.",trolloindos," Bhai ,itna bhi frugal mat bano. Save some money , go to average hostels / dorms . Eat healthy food and clean water . Having Diarrhoea while travelling would be worst than watching RGV ki Aag Haven't done that in a very long time but I can tell you how.

Sleep at railway station (dormitories are quite cheap 50/10 rupees, else you can sleep in waiting rooms). Every decent railway station has a waiting room with toilet and bath. Most tourist places also have Sulabh with toilets and baths but cleanliness varies.

Most places outside railway and bus stations have very cheap food options. Make sure to walk a little outside as those inside and adjoining are bit costly due to location. Focus on heavy filling food like Chole Bhature, Rajma Chawal, dal roti, parathe or whatever local cuisine is available from stalls not dhabas. Any food joint with a place to sit is costly compared to movable stalls. Pack food and water when traveling to touristy places as its quite costly there.

Since you will be walking and traveling in local transport, dont worry about healthy food. You'll digest everything. 10-20 hazar ka mobile hoga, data plan kharida hoga, kapde bhi ache kharide honge magar dhang se khane peene aur rehne ke liye paise nahi hai?

Food,Difficult Room-Mate Experience,11,d00ilw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/d00ilw/difficult_roommate_experience/,16,What has been your difficult room-mate experience? Personality or Habit or any other reason for that.... and how did you overcome that....,Noob_FC," I had to host a roommate for six months in my modest hostel room. He was my ex-girlfriend's brother, so I had to do it out of compulsion. He drove me insane and I couldn't wait for him to leave. Here's a list of things he did:

1) He would wake up at 6 pm everyday and go to bed at 10 am, whereas I am used to getting up at 6 am in the morning. 

2) He would refuse to take a bath everyday. He would shower once every five days and would never brush his teeth before hitting the bed. His breath was horrible and after he left, I had to wash his sheets thrice to get rid of the putrid smell. In hindsight, I should have burned them.

3) Never changed his underwear for days. He used to stink terribly and even upon repeated requests to bathe, he would refuse. 

4) He would eat junk throughout the night and release fart clouds in the room that could suffocate anyone.

5) He would order food late in the night and after eating, he would keep the utensils unwashed for days. There were literally flies and fungus growing on the leftover food and utensils. And he would refuse to wash them! 

6) Would come back to the room at 3 in the morning after loitering around and ring the bell for me to open the door for him. He gave a rat's ass about anyone's time. 

7) Never offered to clean the room even once. His hair would be strewn all over the place and his clothes were in shambles all around the room.

8) Borrowed my scooter, abused it, broke the key, neverrefilled the petrol even once out of courtesy. 

9) Hosted his girlfriend on many occasions in my room when I was not around. 

I'm glad he left! What a nightmare. Came back home one day to see my roommate wearing my shirt and watching TV. When I asked him if he's wearing my shirt, he was like ""Oh right right. Sorry"" and then took it off and gave me and went to the other room and casually wore my other roommates shirt. This was this legends 2nd day living with us and neither me nor the other guy knew him. Luckily me and the other guy were leaving the house in a month and didn't have to deal with him much. For me, somehow it is my current roommate...(I know, the latest is the worst every time)  
We share bathroom in a 2bhk .....I am usually at my work around 7.30... and start my routine around 6.45 leaving at 7.20-7.25...

Pretty normal stuff...

But twice in last 7 days, he gets up and used bathroom upto 7.20... I could understand if he has urgency a day or two... But he still is in the house when I leave.... either doing chore/watching tv... He usually goes to office after 9....

It happened around a month back too. He said he needs to go to office early, but still he reached office at 8.30... That time while leaving to office at 7.50, I pointed out this thing....

I don't understand, how difficult is it to be decent at understanding? Or am I overthinking... Isn't every marriage a difficult roommate experience? Live alone. I rented a small flat for myself.  The reason is I've got social anxiety and I get very uncomfortable around strangers. Shared a 2bhk with a live in couple once.They were fighting pretty much most of the time.Every time i stepped into the kitchen i felt as if i had to clean up after a hurricane.The guy used my bong without my permission.Had to force them to contribute towards the hygiene of the place.Even had to clean up their garbage after they vacated the place as i had paid the entirety of security deposit as they vanished without informing.It was a nightmare.",2019-09-06 02:31:52

I am 15Y male living in Delhi who is having some medical  issues  and wants to discuss. So it started with fever,vomiting  and dehydration. It went on 4 days so we went to Preet vihar Metro hospital and told the doctor my condition.

The 2nd day in the hospital- I was ready for all of the tests and was on fasting. So, first it was the X-ray of my lungs. Nothing special in it. Then went for the blood test. I sat on the chair and saw that she took four capsule and wrote my name on them and filled all of these with my blood. It was too much of blood. Apun ko to ekdum se chakar aa gaye.

I did'nt shared the reports which were normal.

The 3rd day in the hospital- She saw my reports and her words were the same 'admit kar wa do jaundice hai'. So after one day I got admitted on sunday. There was AC and TV in the room that made me smile. No one else except me cared for the TV. So, on the first they took some blood and started   
supplying some fluid medicine through the injection that was implanted on my right hand. On the bottles it was written NS and DNS they also supplied fluid. The next day 6 of my school friends came to me.The days went on and they supplied medicine injected medicines through  injection and gave some tablets. One day 2 or 3 doctor's cane and said that Dengue NS1was positive in the report So they took some blood for platelets count and it was normal. After 5 days of my life at hospital I was discharged and given some medicines and a revisit after 5 days. In these 5 days there was swelling  in the corners of my mouth. So , again went to the doctor, this time it was mumps another blood infection she again gave some medicines some blood reports and a revisit after 5 days. Mumps disappeared in two days. She also took some some blood for LFT,CBC

This time the concern is my platelets had incresed to 480   which should be in range of 163 - 369.

Please help me ,this is concerning me.
Thanks for any help.",KuShAgRa016," Dude. Your direct Bilirubin is elevated. Something is wrong with your liver. Id suggest you to go to a Medical Gastroenterologist. (DM). Don‚Äôt go to a General physician. That‚Äôs my advice to you. I‚Äôm a doctor FYI. Hepatitis Listen dear. I know its bad so bad. But don't think so much. I know its difficult but you've to keep calm. This is just bad time. You've got your body very weak so you've to extreamly take care of yourself. You will be alright very soon. And as much as I know delhi has a bad climate because of pollution and all ald the weather is dangerous. You just be calm and take care everything eill be weln and good soon. Wishes from my side! You probably have some infective hepatitis. Maybe A or E. Highly unlikely its a hemolytic condition as the direct bilirubin is elevated, not indirect. If it is hepatitis, it should resolve on its own in about 3 weeks. It has no definite treatment. Just eat nutritious food and take conservative treatment
A 3rd yr mbbs student btw Go to another doctor. check any other doctor Go to ILBS Hey, doctor from Mumbai here. Firstly, get a second opinion. Your direct bilirubin is too high,. there's something definitely wrong with your liver so I think you should see a gastroenterologist. It could possibly be Hepatitis but I cannot say anything for sure. Your sodium levels are not too disturbing. Best advice I can give over long distance is to take a second opinion with a specialist if you don't get better in a day at most. May I ask do you consume alcohol? If yes, how much per day, how many days in a week and when. Secondly, were you on any medication when the problem started? Is there blood in your urine/stool or is your vomit dark brown in colour? Do you have any rash on your skin, especially look out for one with little purple dots. Take care, Reddit is there with you",2019-09-01 07:59:24
Food,Unpopular Opinion/CMV: Removing stray dogs will increase stray cats which are far worse to the environment.,30,cry16e,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cry16e/unpopular_opinioncmv_removing_stray_dogs_will/,27,"I admit I like dogs but I do not feed or care for the strays. But if dogs are beggars, cats are choosing-beggars. I have seen in SEA countries where dogs were removed from cities and now the cities are infested with cats. 

Cats hunt arbitrarily and they hunt in pack. They'll kill birds, squirrels, owls, crows,destroy plants just because they can do it. They also carry rabies and the mind-control disease Toxoplasmosis(fatal with HIV). Cats have no understanding of boundaries and trespass into anyone's home and bite open food, kill lizards or pets just for the fun of it. 

Adam Ruins Everything has a skit on it :https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpAFpwDVBJQ

Dogs were bred to be compassionate and is not as destructive. Sure few are crazy. I don't have a solution to this mess but I know talking about removing them is very very myopic.",dbejsfau," I seem to be the only one who isn't puzzled by how exactly will the population of cats increase when stray dogs are taken care of. It's not like they have a direct competition for resources/survival. In a Pune (Pimpri) apartment recently, a stray dog bit a little girl's leg who soon died instantly on the spot. The girl's father started a campaign to remove stray dogs from the area and I don't think his is wrong. Such incidents are becoming quite common in big cities but I'm yet to hear a stray cat attacking anyone yet. First of all, there's no proof that toxoplasmosis is a ""mind control disease"", there are some studies going on which link toxoplasmosis to certain mental illnesses, but nothing has been proved yet. TP is mostly asymptotic, but can develop seriousl conditions in people with impaired immunity like HIV, as you mentioned. Wikipedia says almost 50% of world's population carry the parasite. So, if indeed it was a ""mind controlling parasite"", then we can very well conclude that the toxoplasmosis parasite is basically running the world!!

&#x200B;

Secondly, ""removing"" dogs/cats is never the option, the best method is population control by neutering/spaying. But this is expensive and that's why municipal corporations are loathe to spend the money when they can just cull the animals. A lot of people and NGOs end up doing this out of their own pockets. My girlfriend personally pays for neutering and treating all her neighborhood dogs & also raises funds in the college where she teaches to look after the dogs that reside in the college premises. I sometimes help her out with this, and believe me it is not an easy job for common people to do! One of her college dogs had got distemper and had to be put down. Then we had to go an disinfect the whole college premises and vaccinate every stray dog there. Without municipal help, the costs are often too exorbitant to do what we want to do. But still a lot of people try. There's a guy we know who runs his own NGO to look after stray dogs. He takes in any disable dogs he comes across and looks after them.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day, just like humans all animals are unpredictable and can have fits of rage or mood swings, we need to respect all of them. When I was a child, I used to be very scared of dogs, I would try and avoid streets where I knew stray dogs loiter. In my attempts to steer clear of them, I often tried to run away and ended up being chased!! But as I grew up, I learned to treat them with respect as I would do a human, and as a result I have become more friendly towards them, and they towards me.

&#x200B;

I had a classmate long time back who was attacked by her own pet dog who had developed some kind of a disease. Her dog bit her in the face and left her disfigured for life, but this did not affect her love for animals at all. She told me that she was still sad and cried after her pet dog was put down due to the disease. I don't think stray dog population and stray cat population is related in that way, you seem to assume that they are negatively correlated, but like you said, dogs are more compassionate, they don't really kill much, certainly not stray cats which can be ferocious, removing stray dogs or not, there will be little impact on stray cats.

Having stray dog is indeed a problem, so is having stray cats, don't think of excuses to avoid solving a problem, like I can't say congested cities should not develop metro systems because constructing metro systems is costly and without metro systems people can also ride bikes which is a healthier lifestyle. Just spay and neuter them, and let them be We can just sterlize dogs to control their population because frankly speaking their population is out of control and in the neighbourhood they bark at random people, sometimes even bite kids, etc so something needs to be done. [deleted] As someone who's very affectionate towards animals and also recognises the fact that population explosion leads to problems, I'd say both animals have different challenges and I don't know who's better or worse.

Dogs are much more affectionate and understanding towards humans in general but they are a greater challenge in terms of threat from attacks and rabies. They are much more dangerous when in packs.

Cats are comparatively shy and even difficult to spot. Cat bites and attacks are significantly lesser. However my colony has had a cat explosion lately because of which I know their issues. They have the habit of pooping outside people's homes. As you mentioned, they don't recognize boundaries. Cleaning that is a task in itself and they don't even get deterred away easily. Second, they reproduce much faster. A cat can give birth to 12 kittens in an year. >Cats hunt arbitrarily.

Not true.  Wild or semi-wild animals hunt for food only.  What is your source for this statement?


> They also carry rabies and the mind-control disease Toxoplasmosis(fatal with HIV). 

Not limited to stray cats.  What is your source for this statement?
 

> Cats have no understanding of boundaries 

This is an absurd statement. Cats are territorial and their territory can be large.  No animal has the ""human"" concept for boundaries. What is your source for this statement?

I like both cats and dogs.  Please don't let your admitted liking for dogs color your thinking. [deleted]",2019-08-18 20:23:17

Food,Is it acceptable for chefs to use bare hands while cooking? Isn't there a danger of germs or arm hair contaminating the food?,0,clbsaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/clbsaw/is_it_acceptable_for_chefs_to_use_bare_hands/,14,"I realize aspects of Indian food preparation require hands, but was quite surprised to see bare hands being used so liberally at a 5 star hotel (watch ~45 seconds starting 0:46):    
https://youtu.be/rJ55ddmnG8w?t=46  

Aren't there tools to replace hands for Indian food preparation? For example - mixer to ""goond"" aata instead of hands. When you absolutely have to use hands (for example to marinate) - aren't there gloves to use instead? I realize this cannot be expected from small establishments, but was genuinely shocked to see it at a 5 star ITC hotel.",heeyyyyyy," Do they use gloves while cooking at your home? Just curious. Ever seen Jamie Oliver or Gordon Ramsay or Bobby Flay or Marco Pierre cook or bake stuff wearing gloves , Chef's do wash their ‚úã s  and maintain the required hygienic standards , wearing gloves and cooking will just be an hindrance , especially when it comes to cooking Indian food .. Yes, if chef is not suffering from any contagious disease and has washed his/her hands, it is perfectly safe (actually even better) to use bare hands while cooking.

Read this one about [sushi](https://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/scott-rosenberg-gloves-fight-sushi-article-1.2426365). Eh, no. Where did you get the idea? Food has been prepared by hand all over the world since forever. Cooking kills all germs so it does not matter one bit. Small pieces of hair pass through your body harmlessly so no need to worry. Are 5 star hotels banned from using hands in food preparation? What are you even talking about? Have you ever seen anyone cook using gloves? What is wrong with you man? Watch any major cooking show and then delete your post you idiot Where are you from? Go check some 5 star kitchen videos from your own country first :P

Go to youtube and search ""Michelin kitchen <your country>""

Maybe you would stop eating outside completely :) They should but there is no strict regulation in India üáÆüá≥. Even famous chefs like Gordon Ramsey don‚Äôt use Gloves üß§!

Food,[Serious] Looking for Meal Prep ideas for the working professional!,27,ct303l,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ct303l/serious_looking_for_meal_prep_ideas_for_the/,22,"Hi folks! 

I'm looking for some meal prep ideas for Indian food. So far I've got these cubed andhra masala in my freezer that I use for making chicken without much hassle! Have you guys got any so far for? 

Here's what I've been thinking: 

\-- chopping up onions and grinding them to a paste and freezing them into cubes

\-- make some gravy bases in bulk - i.e. I love the mughlai so I'm planning to make this and then freezing them into cubes and storing

\-- readymade upma mixes that you just add water to and heat in microwave for 3-5 mins

&#x200B;

Do you guys have some tips & tricks that you use to make healthy, tasty food?",burgundyColor," Instead of pur√©ed onions, freeze onions that have been browned. Makes things quicker as frying onions is the longest part of most curry bases. You can also freeze chopped herbs in a bit of oil in ice-cube trays to make anything taste fresh. Also boil daals and freeze in portions. All you need to do is a tadka and reheat. Invest in a rice cooker. 10 minutes for fresh rice and you don't have to tend to it. You can also make pulao by sauteing onions and spices and chucking it in the rice cooker with the rice. Just don't put peas or beans in till the end. I don't think you're saving a lot of prep by freezing chopped uncooked onions. You can get one of those onion chopper things to save time chopping onions. Not Indian food but it helps me save time:
 3-4 scoops of oats + 3spoons boutnvita initially and blend.

 Then add 1/4th cup milk blend. 

Add peanut butter and banana (+nutella if not heath conscious) blend. 

Add 3/4th milk blend.

My mother is a housewife with two kids (me and my little brother). I work as a backend developer in Gurgaon while my brother is in 11th standard right now. My parents and my bro are settled in Hyderabad. 

Mom doesn't have a great educational background (B Com. dropout years ago and poor fluency in English). She always talks about wanting her own source of income like starting a small canteen or getting a job or something like that. 

My father quit his job a few years ago and earns a 50k pension. He is trying to setup some business and has blown all his savings on it and has huge debts from some relatives including me. He is also a major self-centered prick who doesn't seem to care too much about my mom and always discourages her...which btw I think is one of the biggest reasons why my mom wants to earn for her own.

I have already suggested her to get started with some English classes because she'll probably have a lot more options once she's fluent in it. Do you guys have any idea how I can help her get some income for herself? What jobs do housewives usually do which doesn't require a great educational background or too much of a time investment but gets some decent pay? Even better if it she can do it from the comfort of home.

Thanks folks!",PrettierDrogba," A home cooked tiffin service?
Baby sitting kids?
Educating nursery/Kindergarten kids? Baking.  Cakes will always be in demand. Let her attend some classes and learn the skills.

Home cooked food. Depending on the location and logistics, she can earn well. If she is good with cooking , ask her to join Tin men. It's a new startup in Hyderabad which does delivery of home made food.

You just have to put all types of food she prepares. Users can order on daily basis or monthly basis.

It's just like Zomato or Uber eats but instead of delivering food from hotels and restaurants they deliver food from home.

In Hyderabad lots of people use Tin men and subscribe food on monthly basis, so it could help her make some money. Hyderabad - Food sells easily. Location in Hyderabad? also post on /r/hyderabad Learning English will be a good skill, but don't think that will land her a job. In her age it's better to play your strengths rather than learning something new,  which let's face it, every damn graduate has done and is better than her. Why would anyone hire a 48 year old woman when they can hire a fresh face 20-21 year old?

As others have stated cooking food is the best way she can get income out of something she has been doing for decades. It's great that you have a start-up available in the city that specifically caters to that niche. Help her get some equipment that will cut down on the prep time. She can get started in no time.

Bear in mind there are no free lunches, people have to work hard to get money, if there were jobs which paid good and could be done in the comfort of people's own homes with little to no investment of time or labour, then every one would be doing it. IMO, food is a good low-risk business and also builds you a loyal network of clients who may be interested in any future ventures.

These people started from one house in Blore and now do good business from 2-3 outlets around the city. However, it is a time investment if it becomes too successful. TINMEN - Home cooked food just register in the website , they will come and take the food from your home and deliver it to customers . There might be alternative apps like this too . I know only TinMen Find your District Industries Centre, they have classes for skill & entrepreneurship development, usually for free. Google Meesho app. Insurance Agent: I've heard they make super money from commissions.   
many of them start as Post Office investment agent. very small commissions there, but you get a nice clientele.  and then widen the scope to LIC agent.  gradually can open MF distributor / agency too.   

have you given a thought about them divorcing ?  
that way. your Mom can get some good chunk of money & half of Dad's pension too. Depends on where she lives there could be multiple opportunities with Self help groups. A small store is also not a bad idea if you have the money to set up a small shop. 

Depending on how desperately does she need money and investment you can put up see below a list: 

1. Cooking for others (home meals, cloud kitchen) 
2. Self Help Groups
3. If she learns some English and if she is bilingual in a regional language (except Hindi), she can translate the Market Research for various research companies. 
4. Kirana stores, dairy store etc. Tinman app. Users can order today what they will have tomorrow for lunch and ladies can prepare the and hand it to tinman people to be delivered.
Try it out. It's kind of cool. Home care for the Elderly parents of NRI‚Äôs or Rich Industrialists especially post hospitalization patients. Online jobs, data entry so on. Bake cakes, food shop, authentic Indian meals home cooked. Web series of cooking for travelers. If she can improve her English, she can perhaps try for freelancing in the entertainment niche? Probably writing news on Bollywood celebs, Indian television shows.",2019-08-13 17:43:03

Bhaiyya josh chada tha, toh use kar liya Moral of the story is to not rely on zomato swiggy in tier 2-3 towns. Delivery drivers aren't very professional there Also a good time to highlight the working conditions the delivery companies create.

While the OP, as a customer, had every right to expect his order untampered, one must wonder the kind of conditions Zomato creates where the delivery boy felt he didn't have the time or the money to buy his lunch. ‡§Ö‡§™‡§®‡•á ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§∏‡•ã‡§®‡•á ‡§ï‡•á ‡§Ö‡§Ç‡§°‡•á ‡§¶‡•á‡§®‡•á ‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡•Å‡§∞‡•ç‡§ó‡•Ä ‡§ï‡•ã ‡§ï‡•ç‡§Ø‡•Ç‡§Å ‡§ñ‡§æ ‡§ó‡§Ø‡§æ ‡§µ‡•ã?

Idiomatic translation in English: Whytf would he kill his own income source? Seriously, Fuck Zomato.  The only good thing they did was Zomato Gold, from which they've pulled the rug under from now. I use the zomato app only for riding out the Gold subscription now. Always go the Swiggy way for delivery. At least they accept responsibility if someone fucks up. Zomato reps just stop responding. Funny is that this is just one guy who accepted that he ate the food. There will be hundreds other delivery guys who may eat some of your food and won't tell you.

Essentially when you order food you should be ready to eat leftovers. Think of it as price you are paying for convenience. WTF. Gwalior did not have a home delivery culture before Zomato I am guessing? LAMO..
i was hungry so i ate it.. [deleted] I had a similarly sour experience with Zomato just yesterday. I had a good Experience with their support , mistakenly rider used delivered option and according to location he was still at restaurant . They give me ZOMATO credit worth of ‚Çπ62 as compensation on order of ‚Çπ202 and apologized for that . I got the food in delivered in less than 10 mins . Before vanced  every YouTube add saw was of Zomato and swiggy but the many, many,many threads here have convinced me never to try the food delivery apps.

Food,Is night shift that harmful?,21,cw1gnt,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cw1gnt/is_night_shift_that_harmful/,15,"I'm working on night shift from 8pm to 6am in the morning for 5 days a week. I started it back in January and still in it. The company is paying me 6k for night shift which they mentioned will add in my ctc after completion of 15 months. Is night shift really bad for health. While in earlier days I used to sleep like 8 hours at day time, now I only get 6 hours and i find it difficult to sleep often times.I can only sleep on weekends the way I want. I'm a fresher who has started his career recently i.e 6 month prior to my night shift. I would love your suggestions from your side for what i should whether to continue my night shift or switch to day.",sup3rcalifragilistic," You need to improve your sleep quality and change the kind of diet you follow. It isn't that harmful , just maintain a proper workout routine and sleep table. i did only nights for a year, did only cause it was a 14 hour shift per day and 3 days a week working. Although i didnt mind it in the beginning it did take a significant toll on my health, i wont advise prolonged periods of it. This was back in 2009-2010 When you're awake, everyone you know would be sleeping and vice versa. Days would be bright and noisy and could give you sleeping troubles. It would/might be difficult for you to form a routine with respect to your eating habits and the likes. Your social life becomes non existent. Definitely not good for your mental health.  
  
Physically, you should mostly be okay because the body needs n number of hours of rest every day and that could be done in day time too. But you might miss out on vitamin D and endorphins. There are other ways to get this though. There's a book called why we sleep. Read it don't keep this up long-term.. but for short-term, think of it like going abroad and experiecing jet-lag. It takes a few days for body to adjust to new time-zone. Our body changes circadian rhythms based on signals that are in-turn based on eyes receiving sunlight.

simulate lighting and sound levels and trick your body into thinking it's night. Escpecially sound. I'd advice those [screw-like silicone ear plugs](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTJiT0bs3aEXyWteWfkHiyC5Ye1slELLrNYHf8GG_6KK4-nrm16).  You will have soundless sleep. Alarm clock sound penetrates through though. They cost around Rs.100. You can get them in medical shops. Depends from person to person, I've had no side effects from doing night shift for the last 3 years. No loss of sleep, or tiredness. But I do have colleagues who get a lot of issues. It's only possible if you fully commit to the night shift. Don't try to do stuff during the day. Eat breakfast foods after waking up and dinner after getting back home. 

Even small things like keeping your room dark and quiet help a lot. Get thick blackout curtains and use earplugs if there is unavoidable noise.

Edit: also maintain your sleep timings, don't change sleep schedules on weekends and holidays. Melatonin is a great sleep aid that I use when jetlagged, it really helps me - may be worth trying it out. I used to live with a guy in Pune who works night shift at a company in Hinjewadi. He is 5‚Äô8‚Äù and weighed about 50kg‚Äôs. At times I actually thought he‚Äôd die",2019-08-27 21:53:35

Sadly at this moment I'm just too much overwhelmed with my family and work.  Right now I will be donating some money regularly but for future I sure hope I can make time to do something myself for others.
I looked through sites of WWF India, giveindia, People's archive for Rural India and Unicef India. I'll donate to them by rotation. Also someone gave the idea to help NGOs and shelters of street animals. I'll do that too.",CrazyHead_Beta," My family found one family who has three kids without father. So, every month we donate to that family. We pay directly to schools and tuition teachers. Sometime they asks for books or bus fare.

Don't just send your money. 

Arrange and do something yourself. Any little thing. Could be running a library out of your garage. Or putting a water tank outside your house in the summer. This will be much more meaningful and satisfying than giving money. 

My mother always chides me for not giving to charity. I strictly won't give my hard earned money if I cannot see its effect on the ground. Instead I choose to give my time to causes that I like e.g. beach clean-up, volunteering in schools etc. Why not sponsor the education of kids of some economically backward people from your own locality??

This is one thing that I kinda always think to myself, if I wanna do something good I should definitely fulfill someone's wish! It really powerful if you think about it.

You don't even need to go out side for it, if you look close enough our parents or relatives always give up on something to survive every month. It could be anything, just think about having their wish fulfilled as gift.

It could be anything, finally going to some place to travel? Buying something they always wanted but they couldn't? There is always some poor kids who don't have enough resources who just want simple stuff in life but they can't afford it.

PS.  Its a rule.  They have to put water dispensers.  But fuckers won't put them. So if you ask them and they deny you can always threaten them about the rule. okay pop corn is over priced but what about water ? OMG ! Two ice creams and one medium pepsi = ‚Çπ420!!!

Abey yar their food sales will increase tenfold if they slash the prices by half. That's when you rob Bandhan bank. 1. I've almost reduced going to watch movies in multiplex to zero. My big TV and online streaming gives me more value for money



2. When I do go, I eat something before hand and just carry a bottle of water. I don't understand why we should buy them? Only If all of us stop buying any thing at Cinemas ...... Can we also talk about airport food? 

I recently landed in bangalore airport and had a 5-hour layover before I took flight to my hometown.

I went for a dosa outside the airport - It was ‚Çπ200+ for a plain dosa, which was terrible. 
A bland, very poorly made curd rice inside the airport was at ‚Çπ168+taxes. WTF dude?

I understand that real estate is more expensive at airports, but how can you hike up the prices 300%? Nowhere else in the world is there such a difference. Airport food is usually 10-20% more expensive but not 2x-3x times like in India. I don't understand, why do people buy from them? An average movie is about 2 hours. You couldn't eat anything before coming to the movie? Why buy such overpriced snack? Just buy a packet of biscuit and eat it before entering the hall. In the US, I can get a movie ticket for 14$ and large tub of popcorn with free refill (put together probably five times larger than the largest you can get in PVR) and a coke medium size for less than 12. That is, a single movie ticket price is more expensive than the stuff you buy for a party of two. Somehow they managed to get the equation reversed in India the stuff costs more than the movie ticket itself. WtF? Who in their right mind orders overpriced food items outside the movie theater? I recently went to Insignia Inox, which has like a base ticket price of 800, but it was a morning show so a lot cheaper. And you go in, and you have like a button to calla butler, and you have Menus next to you. They sell Dahi Puri for 300 While we are on the topic. Can we pls notice that even after literally paying money you STILL GET FUCKINNNG ANNOYING ADS!

I miss the days where they only show you movie trailers. Eat at home before you go to watch a movie. Middle class master race :| Maharashtra mein kya scene hai btw?Allowed to bring your own food kya I was discussing this with a family member and I said that I would gladly pay 100 Rs extra for a ticket for the freedom to bring my own food. That makes much more sense than charging sky-high prices for food. *taalis laat Last time i went to pvr, they charged me nearly 900 rs for a large popcorn and 2 medium Pepsi. Whereas movie ticket price was just 220 rs. PVR and INOX are actually in popcorn business. ^^/s recently went to one of the better pvrs. they had flavored popcorns that they gave out in ziplock bags. we took a medium for 220 bucks chocolate flavor. they were so good and so fulfilling. it was pretty great for 220 bucks. two of us shared that pack and we struggled to finish it off.  

next time went to a not so great pvr. paid 220 for similar popcorn. and it was garbage stale stuff. 

this is what annoys me. Why suddenly people are posting memes in this sub? I feel that they rob us in broad daylight. If questioned that start to fight. Sanki people I must say. PVR is solely the culprit for exorbitant food prices in cinemas. Before PVR expanded nationally, local cinema chains used to offer Popcorn Pepsi combo for 150 and samosa for 40. After looking at PVR's fat margins, other cinema chains got greedy and followed suit. Lol in Cinepolis the medium size popcorn and the large size popcorn price difference is only 10 rupees , so whenever you order medium ,the guy tells you that large costs only 10 rupees more , so you buy the large one anyways also they sell fucking Vada pav for 100 rupees that is ridiculous eventhough they use more p√≥sh looking pav and ingredients. I hate this. Had posted this on Facebook some time back and a 'genius' in my list commented that ""Hey, the cost is high because they're giving you a chance to eat before a large screen."" I was like - that doesn't make any sense.

The concept is of a rental property - you rent a place and you can most definitely have your own food there. For example, hotel room, airplane flight. (The same doesn't hold true for a restaurant because food's the main business of the restaurant. But cinemas? It's bullshit.)

So I told him that cineplexes should be allowed to do one of two things:

1. Don't allow outside food but then charge reasonably
2. Allow outside food and charge whatever they want (like a hotel's restaurant would do).

I also said that I lean towards option 2 because it promotes 'freedom of choice'. It was heartening to see some cities' theatres allow outside food. And here in Australia where I have recently moved, ALL theatres allow outside food, as it should be. Rs.10 coffee for Rs.150. #savagepvr And then they demand Rs. 60 for a 500 ml water bottle which is filled with nothing but tap water. Pespi? Really? Instagram memes on reddit? Lol. Didn't know it was that much cheaper üòÇüòÇ That's the reason I'm bankrupt right now Thankfully, most PVRs have started keeping a water cooler and glasses so that if you're just a little thirsty, you don't have to fork out 80 bucks for a whole bottle. Since they don't allow you to bring your own water in. Brighter side I guess. Popcorn is more expenses than the ticket itself. Dude I feel this meme to my core. Bought 2 popcorns and 2 pepsis, Rs. 1200+

I mean... Wtf. Taalis lakh when pespi chaalis lakh when Pepsi PVR: Popcorn Vada raidshow Taalis Laat I need more indian memes on reddit Dank. Food in cinema is only for crazy rich people. you have made me watch again this part of the movie Cold drinks at 300 wtf not sure if you guys know this but theatres earn very little from ticket sales and most of their earnings come for sales of these food items. For those complaining about the price, I understand all the frustration but remember that a theater's business model revolves completely on the food and beverage sector. Money from the tickets goes straight to the distributor or the production company. Maybe i am mistaken with how it works in India but as per my understanding, Theater's run only due to the sales of F&B on a daily basis and advertisements before and during intermission of the films Need a Indian meme sub why is this so true! These multiplex chains have three main source of revenue:
1. Ticketing
2. Advertisement
3. F&B (Food & Beverages)

F&B segment has highest margin somewhere between 80-85%.

What is your monthly/annual budget coming to anyway? I doubt doggos are as expensive. But kitties are super-amusing(!), if you know what I mean, and might be worth the additional expenditure

I am estimating around 20-25k per year for a single cat if I were to adopt a stray kitten and fed it predominantly a diet of chicken, fish and egg and occasional visits to the vet. Am I right? Any home-made recipes that reduce the budget? What homemade ideas have you been employing to reduce budget and found success with, without your cats disliking the food?

There's also a strong argument against Whiskas cat food (as being junk food). 

Helpful advice would be appreciated. :)",throwawayphilos," Cat food obviously. Also you can buy the gizzards and bones(inedible parts) from a nearby chicken shop, cook and feed. 
The blood line( black part which smells fishy) of the fish can also be used to feed your kitty cat. Usually the fishmonger gives it for free. Remember to cook it however.

If you have a kitten, be careful with fish bones, they could choke.

Edit: don't give them milk, they will drink it alright but they will have a massive tummy upset. 3-4 cats from a nearby temple adopted my dad, and now I subscribe monthly to [this](https://www.amazon.in/Pure-Pet-Ocean-Fish-Adult/dp/B01CQYS1TY?ref_=ast_bbp_dp).

Dad uses coconut shells as a bowl.

Most of them are older and don't mind the dry food.

For wet food, its meat waste(skin, bones, organs etc) from a nearby butcher shop, pressure cooked with carrots and peas for some additional flavour (NO SPICES, SALT, OR SUGAR!) , but it's reserved only for the kittens.

Cats Love roasted sunflower seeds and sour cream (any fermentd milk product).

EDIT: FIXED THE LINK. Cat food, chicken bones and other rejected parts of chicken, if I buy sardines or mackerel I usually buy a little extra and steam them for her and feed her that.

This [ayurveda BS](https://food.ndtv.com/food-drinks/foods-that-produce-heat-in-the-body-1839300) propagated all throughtout India saying how certain food increase body temperature and how certain food decrease it.

For example I was told growing up that chicken, eggs, meats, curd, onions, garlic, mangos etc raise body heat whereas milk, chia seeds and veggies decrease body heat. Where the fuck does this BS come from and why is it so famous? Even doctors spout it now? The latter part I am not making it up, I've been told by more than one doctor by now to avoid certain foods because they 'heat up' your body too much from the inside leading to unpleasant side effects. 

There is absolutely no concept of food increasing or decreasing body heat in mainstream science or atleast the way it is propagated by Indian parents right? Please do correct me if I am wrong because I have been hearing this shit for so many years from so many different places that it is annoying as fuck.",RantsnShitpostsIndia," It is just a colloquial way of saying to stay hydrated. Let's not make everything an issue. 

&#x200B;

Dehydration is a common thing during summers. Hence they say foods to cool down. 

Additionally, we also observe eating spicy or acidic foods and toxic foods, exposure to the sun for long times lead to boils, or heat rashes. 

&#x200B;

Most of the foods recommended to cool down are meant to cool down or are less acidic (like yogurt/ lassi and all)in nature to balance diet. Ayurveda is based on superficial observations and correlations. In fact, there is no need to single out Ayurveda. All pre-scientific ethno-medicines are arbitrary. Traditional Chinese Medicine, Unani (Greek) are based on very basic (often wrong) observations. And our language has not been purged off some badly chosen terms either. For example, the term 'boil'. Why is a skin boil called boil? These common sense terms hinder our understanding.

And these systems did not know about the perception tricks played by brain. Mint 'feels' cold on the tongue because the molecules unlock receptors that are supposed to detect low temperature. Spicy food 'feels' hot and causes sweating because brain is fooled by capsaicin unlocking high-temperature receptors.

Some observations, however, still hold true even when their models were wrong.

For example, a shaman using some leaf paste along with elaborate rituals and dancing to cure malarial fever will be successful. His model might be wrong but he will succeed nonetheless. Only problem is the shaman cannot know which parts of his cure are worthless and which is the active part actually doing the treatment.

Or system which attributes disease like tuberculosis to a spirit and recommends quarantine will be right despite having a wrong model. (spirit rather than micro-organisms)

Ayurveda is the same. It's based on a bad foundation. Naturally, (pun unintended), it will have wrong diagnoses and wrong treatments. And it doesn't help that it's not revised thanks to our taboo of updating ancient wisdom. Food-induced thermogenesis. Different foods have different calorific values. Some foods take more calories to digest and others don‚Äôt so the sum total or calories or heat they add to you is positive or negative. None of this can change the fact that you seem to be a jackass. Just like other bullshits such as positive energy and negative energy.. Try beef and see the difference in your body temperature. IMO it's not about body heat but about how the foods make you feel, mostly in the gastrointestinal tract. Eating a lot spicy food has the opposite effect of eating a lot of curd rice for example and it's not far fetched to associate those feelings with heat and cold respectively. Other foods can be categorised in the same way. It‚Äôs Ayurveda. 

It‚Äôs bullshit anyway. If it's annoying you then why listen? Just do whatever you like Honest opinion, if I eat chicken or certain foods, I do get constipated(even though I ensure I have enough fiber) and limbs are heated.


I have been informed it is that the nature of my body is heat and rather consume it in low amounts. This is personal experience.


For ex : I require cooler AC when compared to other family members. I tolerate winters better but summers are hell.


Hope I get to see a good discussion. Good question though. It's easy to understand, certain food take more energy(heat) to digest than others and it matters during scorching summer Really dude?
You thinking food doesn't affect body temperature? 

Why do you drink lemonade during summer? 

Why don't you ever try eating mangoes(without soaked in water or fridge)? everyone knows it's tummo that controls this force, not food.  2,4-Dinitrophenol  is a drug that is banned in US and UK, is used by many body builders to rapidly burn off body fat. The drug works by forcing the cells to use up the ATP rapidly, forcing the body to tap into existing body fat. It was used by Russian soldiers in WW2 to stay warm in severe Siberian winter.

This drug comes with a risk of acute toxicity and is known to be lethal. One of the ways it kills is by increasing the core temperature , resulting in organ shutdown. Essentially, a chemically induced lethal heat stoke.

&#x200B;

Also,  d-*amphetamine* , a widely known recreational drug is known to decrease heat dissipation and slow the rise of core temperature. It was widely abused by runners and endurance athletes till reports of death due to extreme muscle fatigue and heart failure started to show up. Essentially ,it turned the body into a heat sink that would absorb more heat than dissipate. You‚Äôre taking it too literally.  The body heat that your mom mentions is not temperature. Bhai thoda chill maar Yeah chief, you are unfortunately after falling down a long fad diet hole.

Do yourself a favour and forget about it. It's the hot and cold diet today tomorrow it'll be liquidised steak enemas. The sooner you learn to disregard these people rather than try and change their opinion the happier you will be in life.

Unfortunately some people are far more susceptible to nonsense like this and many other products (which is why they exist) so just let them waste their lives on it and when they talk to you about it nod and agree.

The simplest way of looking at it is this: if you and your brother were of different religious backgrounds (pick any two) and he kept bringing up how his way was better than your way - would you ram your idea down his throat or stop talking to him because of it? No you'd just get on and not talk about it ever. Neither of you could be 100% right about it and you would never convince the other person, so what is the point?

Now you've gone and gotten yourself all annoyed and hot about this silly topic so go have some cooling eggs... Or was that heating eggs? ;)",2019-06-11 03:42:03

Edit:

Ravish Kumar systematically takes down the PM's interview with Akshay Kumar using satire and mangoes effectively.

""Today I want to talk about non-political things. I do not want to talk politically. I am bored of political talk. I thought I would do something non-political. Do something in which there is no politics. The election is too long. Reporters are also tired. Some reporters did not get a hold of Modi-Modi from the outside and returned. The reporters bent their heads when the editor asked for the budget.""

""Then another reporter was sent. They placed their ear to the ground. Listened to the under-current. This is the change in 2019. The current is underground. Instead of waves there are under-currents now. Underneath the ripple has come. Lou runs above, the undercurrent runs below. So thought that when politics is not happening in the season of politics, then in this season we get out of politics. To do something different.""

Many people on here seem to misunderstand the word ""bias"". Opposing a current govt is *not* bias. Refusing to sing praises of the present govt is *not* bias. Bringing to attention where a govt has fallen short is *not* bias.

In fact, it's the job of the media to keep the ruling party in check. To remind the public that all is not well. To maintain transparency. To expose the liars.

Things that *do* constitute bias: false equivalency, what-aboutery, lying to the audience (whether outright or by omission).

Also, people are allowed to have opinions. Vishal Dadlani is not someone who needs to be neutral; he's not a public servant or a newsman. The question of bias is not relevant here at all. Randeep Hooda, Virender Sehwag - BJP Me What is this for? End purpose? Mohandas Pai, former CFO of Infosys is a rabid BJP supporter, just like most bigots in India. A-grade hypocrite too.

After a very ugly breakup 4-5 years ago, I extremely hated every female on the planet. It took me months to come out of such unreasoned hatred. But this is the 3rd time one of my childhood friends is marrying a rich dude. I know it is not wrong, but it totally kills off any motivation for doing better in life. This unfair advantage girls have over guys is reinforcing my reasons to hate girls.

I know not all girls are like that. My ex bought a Honda Amaze on her own, by working her ass off and paying EMIs. My friend from university bought a Tesla. But every day, you hear one of your friends say things about girls which only reinforces the belief that girls are gold-diggers. Are they really that pretty? some are but not all. But despite working so hard in almost every aspect of life, a girl from next bench who hasn't worked at all is getting everything I desired. Then why did I work hard? Why should I from now on? What can I say, I'll marry a girl and would be able to afford a vada-pav may be?",killerdrama," There are guys who marry for job/wealth and stuff as well. Life is unfair if you compare yourself with others. You gotta do what you gotta do. Idk who even told you life is fair. Hardwork leads to success. But hard work isn't the only way to success.

You're totally disregarding the fact that guys get dowry. My neighbor works at a bank as a Junior Officer on Contract. He gets 20k per month and his job isn't even permanent. But he lives in a house that costs a crore and a half, drives a car that costs close to a crore and has a bike that costs 20 lakhs!

And he's not an outlier, the dowry given over here are huge and its there everywhere. My mother's friends boast off about how their son got acres of land , houses and expensive watches in dowry. All their sons are average engineering folks from a tier 3 college working for an IT company. :3 Bhai do you have any idea how much guys get in dowry? Their whole life revolves around getting a good job so their family can extort good dowry from girl's family. They get inherited bunglows, cars, fridge, TV, washing machine, expensive gifts etc you name it, and this is out of compulsion. What your friend got was a gift, she didn't ask for it. This way, men are bigger gold diggers. Stop acting like the world owes you anything. Life isn't supposed to be served on a silver platter. You're making excuses for your own incompetence. Life is unfair, dude. That's the simplest way to look at it. I feel like you quite a lot, but then what makes me stop thinking this way is when I see daily wage laborers or these people who do odd jobs, no matter how hard they work, they will never have a comfortable life. I start to think, how would they feel when they look at us.

I'm not undermining what you are feeling by saying the last thing. Like I said, I feel the same way, but yeah. Life is unfair. Hi.

I feel you.

I really do.
An ex of mine left me for a richer dude. It shattered me to pieces. I was devastated. There was no motivation for a good while. I was cutting myself ( I hate people who do it, it achieves nothing, just like suicide).

I know what you're going through.

I find solace in the fact that no one can point at me and say ' Baap ka paisa'. 

I made myself. You'll too. 

Men want just one thing dude. And that one thing is disgusting. Men just want Man Samman.

Its all that will ever matter.

I hope this helped. Life is different for everybody and in every aspect. Why wasting time and mindfulness on comparing yourself to someone else. What do you want? What will you have to do to achieve it? Fuck rest of the world and work on that.

And yes, please change the scale which you use to measure happiness. A Mercedes is happiness for 2 days. Inner satisfaction is the key. Get their. Life doesn‚Äôt owe you anything. Life doesn‚Äôt have to be fair, life doesn‚Äôt have to be unfair. It is what it is. There is no logic or rewards systems with life. Sometimes you get what you deserve and other times you don‚Äôt, this can either be good or bad. 

All you can do is, put in your best and hope you don‚Äôt get a hot pile of shit in return. C‚Äôest la vie. ",2018-05-12 22:02:19

Non-Political,[non-political]My solution(s) for Whatsapp forwards causing havoc.,0,8wr0y2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8wr0y2/nonpoliticalmy_solutions_for_whatsapp_forwards/,9,"1. Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob (This will be easy to implement as people never edit the message and just keep forwarding it.)

2. If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people and only allow them internet when they are properly educated about the norms and ethics of being on internet (Why not under a national program like Pradhan Mantri Kaushal Vikas; This type of **""Vikas""** is in dire need)",sangar-happy," > Ban Whatsapp forwarding of a message

Thats such an Indian way to deal with anything, end all solution - ban, though it may not be effective.

> which has been already forwarded by 'n' people unless it is inspected by the company/police to be not fake news or not an attempt of instigating the mob

This would also require Whatsapp, the organization to track each and every message being shared on their app. At the moment, it has end-to-end encryption.

> If possible ban the internet for 'uneducated' (debatable) people

Who is going to implement such bizarre solution on the ground.

Will the government come up with public-private participation issues licenses for internet fitness test?

edit: a special character TIL Most frequent costumers of this place are Narendra Gandhi and Rahul Modi. How to piss off both sides at once  Expensive place. As someone pointed out, 100 rupees for Maggie, 20 rupees for a normal chai and 90 rupees for poori sabji


The staff( not being racist, but mostly people from North East ) is very slow and often forget the order. I'm talking about the hsr one.


Open place. People can smoke there. I tried some sandwich at the hsr outlet. Pretty expensive but tasted quite alright. Next parliament session here. Why does this sound like a ship name for Modi and Rahul? after seeing this place Amit Shah would be like :Iska maalik bahut chatur baniya tha. Rahulji and mudi restaurant and roadside chai.


I bet the chai sucks there. Trying to be the best of both.

Non-Political,[Non-political] A/c train queue system implemented by people on their own,1596,8gwqi3,https://imgur.com/x2S75mL,207,,imacrazydude," Isnt this a given thing at delhi metro stations now? Bas kar pagle,rulayega kya ? [removed] All those people who are amused by it this is what happens when you give them some infrastructure.  

With Air conditioned trains the doors are closed and open only when the train actually stops.  So you have to wait anyway. 

With other locals I have seen even auntys  board the train before it actually stops so that they can grab a seat.  No way they will wait for the train to stop because some other aunty would have grabbed the seat by then. 

Now if you really want to ensure people queue up start installing platform screening doors.  But that's expensive and I don't have any expectations from Indian railways.   Fake fake fake! OP paid the people to stand in a line! Only if this was followed for every other train too, every morning is a fight to get into a Churchgate bound train Wtf is happening? In which alternate universe is this borivali station located? Propaganda. Next thing you know they will tell that first people will be allowed to get off the train and then people will board the train. Nonsense. Wonder how this happened? Was there constant messaging to nudge people to do this? How did you manage to travel to a parallel universe? History time. When I was growing up in Mumbai in  late '80s every bus stop south of Sion used to have an orderly line to board the bus. It was very similar to this [video](https://youtu.be/ats8Y1yzgPI?t=182). Somehow the suburbs were always unruly. 

Cars waiting at red light was also very common and so was crossing street only when walk signal was on.

But there was always mad rush to board the trains. This is very refreshing.

 Queue!? ab ye kaunsi nayi western concept laye ho?

Hamare sanskriti mai koi queue nahi hota.Kabhi sunna hai pushpak viman mai chadte waqt log queue mai kadhe the?  If I were first in line, I'd just be terrified that the entire line will push forward at anytime even before the train arrives.  I recently made a trip to europe and I was amused to see how the locals were civil to other people. If there's something that Indians need to badly improve - its being civil to others. That huge fan though. People of Mumbai always surprise. The roads are crowded but flow is always smooth Its because its an A/C TRAIN. CIVILISED PEOPLE USE IT. JUST SAYIN  Yay, Mumbai! But there should be markers so that people can queue up on either side of the door and let people alight properly first. After looking this picture I am crying from inside.  Wait there are AC trains on the local lines? I catch a train from andheri in the evening everyday and this is a common sight only in the women's compartment though.. great to watch.

Also, andheri station is jam-packed in the morning and people had to literally fight for climbing up. The last two months have seen a major change and Now everyone stands in a proper queue Wow, this is the India I want to see.  Haath pe chapti maar re. Oh wait...... that's central line. Don't know when central line will become decent. Good to see some positive story since  ages This can only happen in non-rush hours in Mumbai Locals. 

If people start queuing at rush hour the line will stretch for 2 kms outside the station.  Aaja Bhai Tu Bhi Line Mein This is a very interesting experiment in Indian behaviour.

1. If you somehow project the idea of discipline onto people, 95% of them will follow. 50% of these will be rowdy and lawless while taking a local train but will suddenly stand in line because there's a line expected or being formed in front of them in the metro [I've seen this happen IRL].

 And while the line collapses pretty soon, it is still an attempt at order which partially succeeds in two ways - people can alight without battling through a wave of incoming bodies, and folks who are right in the front of these lines get assured seating/standing of their choice.

2. You will see people blatantly flouting rules, throwing their garbage on the floor etc. on normal train platforms. But our metro stations? They're some of the cleanest places in India. Just look at the difference in India's metros - be it Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai... The cities is filthy, the metro system is clean as a whistle.

3. The security system works. Not for its intended role, but it keeps loose food and drink outside the metro system.

I believe civic planners and govt officials can learn some lessons here. *Rechecks*
Am I on the right sub reddit ? 
*Rechecks* There is hope for the country. Demonitization actually had a few benefits!!! Next thing you know people will stop littering.  Then when the streets are clean the cops will stop beating and extorting street vendors and the poor.  Then that will have a snowball effect, and the road workers will start repairing roads with enthusiasm.  Traffic will move smoother and people will be in a better mood, they'll stop going out at night to rape innocent women and children.

Finally, the politicians will see all this and ask for 2% less bribe. This works only until the train arrives. Then it's a free for all. Nice quality! Which camera? Which station? And then there's that one mandatory asshole who decides to jump the queue and plunges everyone into the usual state of chaos.

Cleverest people , if all mumbai and suburban trains do this , half the problems will be solved . nice post Kaun hai yeh log, kahan se aatey hain ye log? This is common in mumbai at bus stops. In fact no where in India do people 'follow traffic rules' as much as mumbai in my experience.  What alternate universe is this? Sandwich massage for free I can confirm that this happens in the gold class of dubai metro whereas as in normal compartments people just rush in and out like in india They do this in nyc too........  Security staff in Bengaluru metro makes people queue up like this. All of that vanishes once the train arrives lmao Yeh kabse hone laga yaha??? üòØüòØ  Nice editzz Queing for reserved ticket isn't a big deal. But for local it is. It is impossible . looks like they renovated borivali When people start building a whole railway station on their own without any corporation help, I'm not amused when they start standing in queues.

I'm looking for neutral viewpoint and dispassionate analysis. I personally believe if you passionately hate or support something, you lose the objectivity.

I think it's a step in right direction. However, there is a lot of scope for improvement. I have couple of points to add. Please correct me if I‚Äôm wrong and share your valuable insights. Also, comprehensive study articles/papers is most welcome.


* For starters, the rates are quite confusing. and I spoke with a CA guy, he thinks there are a lot confusion as of now. So I think we can say it's in beta phase. After the implementation, govt would need to sort out various issues and make sure it increases the efficiency. Also, I think rates for various items have been decided in haste and randomly. So, that has to be addressed after the implementation.


* I think it doesn‚Äôt solve the central issue. Police at the state borders will make other excuses to stop trucks and demand bribes. One of my relatives is truck transporter. If the driver doesn‚Äôt pay the bribe, police simply break their headlights and then charge the fine. This is a lot common. In this respect, GST barely helps in faster movements of goods. Since petroleum and Alcohol has been kept out of GST, police can stop trucks to check these items.

* It‚Äôs far from one tax one nation. The proposed tax structure includes a Central GST, a State GST and an Interstate GST. ‚ÄúGiven the current structure, if a person does business in three States, he has to get six registrations and make a number of regulatory filings.

* The Central GST Bill allows the central government to set up an anti-profiteering authority by law, or designate an existing authority to carry out the functions.  The authority will be responsible for ensuring that the reduction of tax rates on account of implementation of GST results in a commensurate reduction in prices.  India has had bad experience with new monitoring bodies. I am afraid this will simply turn another method of officials to strong-hand the honest business and extort money if there is no proper oversight on anti-profiteering body. CVC in railway was established to catch corrupt officials. It is yet to catch a single official and we know how much corruption is there. This will lead to more govt; more govt means more corruption and inefficiency.

* I think it will take atleast 2-3 years to have clarity on rates and various legal issues. Till then, there would be chaos and inflation will generally increase. After that, if govt make right iterations, we might see the benefit of GST.

* Lastly, In India reforms generally work in different way. Govt takes 3 steps ahead and after much brouhaha it takes the two steps back. So, you are left with only one step in right direction which is better than zero steps ahead.
",Responsbile_Indian," I actually welcome the One Nation; One Tax system. But with GST, this primary objective is defeated when we have multiple tax rates. But there is hope the rates will be made homogeneous over a period of time.

GST is taunted  as a measure to reduce the paper work and complexity of businesses. But the government failed to address where WE the consumers are in the equation. It was advocated that the less procedures and simplicity in tax returns would increase the efficiency and would result in reduction of cost which will ultimately benefit the consumers.
However, with the raise of key services like banking, insurance, etc from the existing 15% service tax to 18% GST, the consumer interest takes back seat. For service industry I believe they should have atleast kept in a similar rates since there is no visible benefit when you are going to higher tax for the same shitty services.

The governments preparedness with systems is questionable since there were reports that the implementation dates should be postponed due to this. But the government is firm on implementing from July 1st, as with demonetization they are not bothered with the consequences. But this will ultimately affect the businesses and result in lower growth.

As you mentioned, registration with multiple states and filing returns would defeat the primary purpose of GST. Also for inter-state transactions, the government advised the business to continue using the existing forms, so the state border checkposts will remain.

Yes in longer run probably 3 - 5 years the system will mature and we may even have one single rate for all commodities in the future.

  To tell you the truth OP I still don't understand what the GST does . I mean I get the gist of it like all indirect taxes will be abolished , different tax rates by different states will now be the same but other than it I still don't know what it is going to do I think a lot of us cheered its passage, but in hindsight, I really think the BJP should have waited until securing its own majority in the Rajya Sabha instead. As you, OP, point out, they ended up having to make too many mini concessions to get everyone on board, and the effect was just replacing 28 different complicated, bureaucratic AF tax systems to one big one. 

But it's a step in the right direction. In hindsight a lot of Modi bhakts (myself included) naively supposed this was going to be a quick shot, overnight process - I think successive governments will keep tweaking it. Hopefully. Why would inflation rise? [deleted]",2017-06-23 22:02:19

Non-Political,[Non-Political] Ola Cabs in Bangalore,168,4445au,http://imgur.com/WlZaVSy,62,,xmen81," And when you confirm your ride, some driver from 2km away will come to pick you up. Wonder how many of them on the map are fake. Aahh.. An urban-dweller's dream come true They are having an n-some That is some really shitty experience.

Even though you have a 100 cars, just keep a limit on how many cars you want to show on the app.

Expectation Setting : The road is literally filled with cabs. You will get one in like a minute or so. 
Result : Still get a cab that is 2 kms away or more than 10 mins away. Well that's just the weekly ola orgy being carried out in peace Bangalore is the only major city in the country where you can  park pretty much where you want.  I don't think I've ever seen cars being towed or asked to move off any road here.   Just curious, what is that place on the right where they have a shitload of cabs? I used to live in that neighbourhood 4 years ago. There were zero normal cabs. The times, they change! Why does it say Indra Nagar near Jakkur? Better than Uber I think, got an Alto 800 today in Uber. I'm 5'9"", my colleagues are 6'2"" and 6'. It felt like solitary confinement in there. [removed] And despite the shit load of cabs present, there is not a single TFS cab.

It's always the case, the 6 Rs/Km cab is a myth. that's what is called a cluster fuck I really, really, really like this image.  You're lucky that a cab is in your area. My area is quite away from the main city and most of the time there are no cabs in the area. One time I had to go to the station and I couldn't find one, Uber saved the day (but with 1.4x price surge). It could be entirely possible that most of them are on their way somewhere else and hence showing on the map?  The Ola Centipede Now I know why traffic is so bad in Bangalore.  Seen something like this on BTM last Saturday morning around 11 AM. It was still 1.5 times, waited for some more time it became 1.3. Then i saw TFS car and booked it immediately without any surge pricing. 

I use OLA a lot, have been to cars couple of times when driver said it is their first day in OLA.

No way people are tall as that in India. Sad that this data is bullshite of the highest order. Woooo, I'm on a list.  [deleted] I spent 2 hours to make this dashboard using **Tableau Public** software. I, unfortunately, do not have any knowledge on data parsing and had to resort the *sarkaari daftar* way of filling up an Excel sheet manually. You can interact with the dashboard by clicking on any State on the map and will get a result at the bottom of where you stand compared to other Redditors from the same state. You can also hover over a State to summarize the results of the survey.
For the interactive dashboard, please follow the link below- [Interactive Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/profile/shantanu.mendhekar#!/vizhome/HowtallarerIndians/Dashboard)

If you are interested in knowing how the dashboard works, or want me to make more such dashboards then let's work something out! Appreciate the job you have done OP. Irrespective of the veracity of the data, everyone from r/india is appreciative of the effort you have put forward in this. 

I amean cummon guys. The guy did something productive. Appreciate the effort and then bitch about heights. Saare pheku bhare pade hain yaha!  I realize that this map's data can be normalized and would be useful as which parts have the biggest 'phekus'. I am guessing that was the surveys intention.

Need a similar thread to collect data on dick and tit size of randians with proof ofc. Nice job OP but 100 isn't a good enough number to get a proper sample. Most people with average or below average height aren't likely to say it, so the average isn't necessarily an 'average'. Just wanted to add that caveat. Nice job otherwise!  How did you know my state? Garbage in garbage out. Iam a midget in my own country üò¢ Jesus.... This wasn't about penile length. No need to lie for this one. The problem is most people overestimate their height. It's a common phenomenon. Most of my friends initially would say that they are 5'10 or 6 feet but they were quite shocked when actual measurement (using a stadiometer) showed that they overestimated their height by 2-3 inches their entire lives. Using a measuring tape to measure height might be prone to errors unless you are making sure that the tape is exactly perpendicular to ground. Even a slight difference in degree of inclination would result in overestimation by 1-2 inches. Therefore my tip would be to actually get measured guys. You'll be shocked !! [deleted] [deleted] Thank you for the overwhelming response, guys.

To reply to all of you -
1. The sample size is, of course, minuscule compared to our overall population of 1.3 Billion people. Actually it is just 0.0000001% of the entire population. So take the visualization with a *chutki bhar namak*.

2. The thread from which this data off of was not a proper survey. So, if you all are interested in a such visualizations, we can have short surveys using Google Forms.

3. I will be making more of such visualizations, since we don't have a dearth of data regarding India. You can check our own initiative here- [Data.gov.in](https://data.gov.in/)

4. The data visualization software that I have used is Tableau Public, where you can visualize any data the way you want for FREE.

Someone/people are sure salty.. Which state did you put me in? I never told you my state bro gays and grills combined???? No way 6.2 is the avg height in Kerala. I'm 5.10 and I feel tall when in a bus in Kerala. There are a lot of people that are taller than 6, but it is no way the avg 6'4"" in Jharkhand? I have to see that Now we are done with heights how about we compare penis size now? Some serious errors in the calculations. For ex: average of Telangana is around 6 ft 1.5 in (5'9"", 6'1"", 6'2"", 6'6"") but is shown as 6'5"".  Let's conduct it again seriously! Also using metric please. It gives more accurate values. I see a nice gaussian distribution :) You aren't supposed to measure along the rice belly, people! Again, last on the list.

Commited suicide on train tracks after getting disowned by his parents for wanting to be a DJ and not an engineer.

Fell in with a bad crowd while at Coimbatore, went on a spiral of drugs and alcohol before his untimely demise.

Mom and dad tried their level best to get his parents to reconcile with their child, but they only woke up when he was gone. His older brother went mad with grief and had to be placed under permanent psychiatric care. The first boy in the class, everyone thought he will be a doctor or an IITian. Went and got a MA in english, now teaching in some college, has a grillfriend and enjoying life. Meanwhile I'm toiling away 9-5 in an IT company. [deleted] went to IIT, i went to another *IT

he went onto MIT, i was jobless

he has some patents, ted talks to his name; I'm here on reddit talking about him :) I was the second last in class. My mom always compared me to the first in class. Let's call her C. C fell in love and married a guy in her first year of engineering at IIT. Promptly stopped her studies. Right now, her husband became an alcoholic because of some financial liabilities. 

She has two kids, recently met her in a supermarket. The girl I talked to not more a dozen times in our 12 years of studying together recognised me and talked to me. 

She lost her bubbly personality and have this calm and measured demeanour. I just wish she does well in her life. 

On a side note, I got a fb request from her today. 
 My mom and dad wanted me to be like neighbour's *beta!* or the first, second or third boy in the class. 

Sadly I used to be in the top 2 of the class, yet they always compared me with others. :( [deleted] Really lucky my folks never compared me to anyone or asked to be like 'someone else'. Did an M.Tech from IIT, worked at Intel for a few years and now doing MBA from IIM Ahmedabad.

Man that guy rocks. One scored AIR 40 in AIIMS entrance, but cutoff was 39. He's doing MBBS in KEM Bombay and has won several international competitions.


The other guy graduated from IIT, is earning fabulously in Goldman Sachs.

(Not that kid but an elder relative) The third is Additional  Secretary, Government of Gujarat.

Though, he's happy with my status In Jail for rape. in some college in chennai, heard he was going to us of a for a MS program. the other grill i was comapred to, took SAT and doing undergrad in the hell down under. the final one is in a local college back home and he hasn't been placed yet in his final year. There is always one dude to whom I get compared all the time.  One of them is doing his masters at Columbia. The rest aren't doing anything special.  Engineer. My mom wants me to do MS .But i know i'm never good at studies .
i'm now having the dream job that i always wanted .

When the topics comes i'll just escape the conversation.

Non-Political,[Non-Political] Vodafone had been extorting my balance for the past 2 months and blocking my calls to their customer care number.,18,6t66al,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6t66al/nonpolitical_vodafone_had_been_extorting_my/,15,"So for the past 2 months Vodafone has been tormenting me. Last month there was a series of deductions from my balance amount for the so called VAS, none for which I have requested. Activation of VAS went on for 3 weeks in which.I lost amount 5 to 9 rupees and each happens on a day to day basis. I was refunded the first two times. But, as it started happening on a daily basis, I was denied access to  their customer  care dept.( It was denied because, i was able to connect them through other Vodafone numbers)

 I took resort in Twitter and contacted them . They did reply instantly with a message that their executive will be calling as soon as possible. None of those people called. ( I continued pestering them for two days, still those hyprocrites were in connivance).
Only after emailing and doing MNP message , i got calls from Vodafone to ask why i did the MNP messages.( they wanted to know what made me to port from their network [and after all these calls and tweets] SMH).  They did refund ,but only after 2 emails, 10 tweets, and 3 calls from another number.

So , that was last month. Yesterday , I unknowingly used up my 1 GB data pack along with my remaining balance . As usual, I proceeded to recharge through Paytm. Surprise!!! processing failed!! one, two, three, leave it,  six times, the processing failed. Tried with the Vodafone App, nope!! all the tranaction pages starting showing 'Request page cannot be processed ' messages( data packs can be activated  but no talktime ones)Tried calling their customer care, again surprise!! call doesnt go through.

Has anyone got any idea why those hypocrites are doing this to me. Is there any way I can sue them for my hassles? 

",finalbeer," Send the Port message. They will immediately call you. I had this problem a lot. I was skeptical at first but it turned out that it was an App that had ads which would get activated even though I didn't tap on them. It was Boost For Reddit in my case. Now I avoid using it. Are you using any app that has ads at the bottom?  I am in the same boat as you, except I have postpaid. I emailed them and  threatened to not pay the bill and threatened to go to their competitiors if they continue the nonsense of adding VAS charges (which they added 366 rupees this month when my usual bill is 360 Rupees!). They said they will credit the same in the next bill cycle. I suspect they are lying. So I shot back an email saying I want it done for the bill I am about to pay this month. It looks like they have obliged. But, I won't be sticking around with them anymore. They do it all the time. Register a written complaint via email, it works everytime, also it means that those who cannot send email and are not assertive enough (read most of the people) will not get there balance back and will have to way to stop further wrongful deductions. I think this is deliberate and standard operating procedure of the telcos. They do it all the time.

As far as I know they are hosting an entire event based on the hashtag, it wouldn't be long till people start screaming the hashtag around couples who just want to spend some time together. 

This just feels weird.

Edit : #PyaarEkDhokhaHai translates to #LoveIsBetrayal
Mostly targeted towards singles who are frustrated about not having a date for Valentine's.",BacchaYadav," Yep, yet another ""let's get viral"" tactic, looks like.  It was ok at first but now it feels forced. Tanmay Butt if you're reading this, tu sannyas le bhai.  World is coming closer to Black Mirror day by day!
Episode: Hated in the Nation I agree.

I don't mind the hashtag, but the event and all is stretching it. It just sounds kinda stupid and weak to me. Bhaiyya toh kya samjhe ki youtube pe intellectuals milenge?  Unsubscribed from AIB's channel a long time ago, quiet happy. [deleted] I'll happily debate anyone who says PyarEkDhokhaHai

Because I've experienced the opposite What does PyaarEkDhokhaHai  even mean?? Mediocrity sells and AIB are doing a good job at it . Guess now they are the Salman Khan of YouTube. Never followed them or such. They are for urban teenagers who don't have a sense of humour and don't know words beyond bhencho.

 Exactly! It‚Äôs just silly IMO  I was thinking this while going through their Instagram story as well. Kinda seems like an exercise in futility.  Please tell me it is just a joke and not an actual event that people are attending.  If someone provides the translation I can also decide to outrage.  To Be Honest, The whole bashing of couples and the Valentine's Day/Week was fine until a certain point. Making light-hearted memes, cracking poor jokes was fine. But this whole hashtag and the upcoming events planned by AIB and others is meaningless and capitalises on the frustration of singles who can't get into a relationship despite desperately wanting to! I'll probably get a lot of downvotes for this but I think it's a very clever marketing strategy. At the and end of the day AIB is a brand and they seem to have figured out a viral branding technique cashing in on the large pool of single people who are active on social media.    
   
I'd also like to ask everyone calling them the personification of mediocrity to give me some examples of good Indian brands in the content space.  Can anyone fill me in on what it's about?


Also ,fuck AIB, mediocrity personified. They're finally living up to their name, in a literal way. they have sponsors. Don't take this shit seriously Can we stop having self derogatory memes until a point people seriously start believing it and trouble/judge others if they talk about having a better experience?   

I mean, I have never dated hell I am shy as fuck if I need to approach a girl but I know it will work if I want it to work and try to make myself a decent human being. I don't even get it. Is it supposed to be ironical? Sarcastic? Commentary on regressive society? AIB is still a thing? Finally somebody said it!! Hosting an entire event on that is just too ridiculous. Atleast screaming the hashtag around couples seems like a fun idea to me.",2018-02-14 08:58:38

She sees you as a friend and has made it clear that she is not interested in you for anything intimate. It's best for you to use your emotions somewhere else. If you don't believe me then ask her clearly, saying hey <her name>, do you think we two could be together as a couple. She will give you a straight no. Start flirting with her. Take it slowly but definitely let her get the hint that you are interested in being more than just friends with her. You have hidden your intentions so far out of fear and maintaining this act is not going to help you. Some Chad might come into her life and take her away from you. If you don't tell her she'll never know. She also might have feelings for you that you don't know about. Be brave and tell her that you like her, but be subtle about it. See how she responds and then take it from there. Itna sudhra hua na Bano ki saamne vaale ko lage ki asexual ho Stop being her gay BFF and ask her out already. Otherwise, like the other guy said, emotional tampon bane reh jaoge. She will use your shoulder to cry on and find some other guy's dick to ride on.

I know it sounds rude, but its just the way the world works. Always better to learn the lesson early in life. Tell her your feelings either she says yes or friendship ends. Or she knows and keeps the friendship which is painful. And everyone knows.

Non-Political,India's first lesbian ad. [Non political],150,39e6ni,https://youtu.be/Ef27m5ocK6Q,106,,neoasr," Fuck them, still not installing their stupid app. Its a pain to browse stuff it that and it takes an unusually long time to load.  What is this supposed to be an advertisement for? What is so special about anouk that makes it especially suited for this or any couple?

A Zomato lesbian ad could have been much better.

""It's your turn to cook today""

""But I cooked yesterday!""

""Fuck it, let's just eat out.""

Cue *Bow chicka bow wow* Nope, still not downloading the Myntra app If they r lesbians, which one gets dowry? This isn't an ad.. this is a short movie.  This is absolutely disgusting. What the fuck is happening to our culture? How can we allow this? Why the fuck is she is marrying a north Indian? 

Edit: Holy shit, my fourth gold in the last two months! Thank you /u/robojunkie for this gilding Kudos! Although I guess the first one was by fastrack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmk9D53G6F8 Couldn't take this shit. The Tamil was horrendous.  The kurthas were *meh*.. Good thing Myntra does not have a offline store üòú  Seriously impressed!

Would love to see this and other ads like this air on national television. When more and more kids start seeing these things on TV, the more ""normal"" it becomes for them. What is this ~~ad~~ short movie about? It just shows two people in a relationship where one person is waiting for her parents to show up. I felt that the advt. was more focused on showing the relationship than the kurta! Ads can be lesbian too. TIL. Plot twist. The girl in blue is actually dying of cancer and is breaking the news to her parents.  Good job. LGBT rights are an important contemporary issue and there is an urgent need for a public conversation in this regard. Sensitizing the public about different sexualities is a very welcome initiative. 

That said, corporate appropriation of a social cause is ALWAYS meant for profiteering, and any positive effect is merely incidental, not at all a stated aim. **A good example is how the Tobacco companies targetted women by making cigarettes a symbol women's liberation**.  [A stanford study on this issue](http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2012/stanford-researchers%E2%80%99-cigarette-ad-collection-reveals-how-big-tobacco-targets-women-and)

Basically, if you feel shitty about Myntra, this ad should not be a reason for you to change your mind.  But Wtf is the ad even about?  I like the clockwork orange poster, tho Soooooo... Who ate Chow mein amongst them? As a South Indian, I am impressed that recent movies / ads are casting super hot girls as South Indians. I can't say I have met many like that in real life, but if feels gooood maaaaann!! :D And randians get mini orgasms. Same gender couple TVC done by Titan Fastrack 2 years ago [np]

But at then End of video , their attempt to sound like firangis is horrendous ...  W8 I just realised something, are there anywoman in r/India? 

         I always wondered why companies think they are in the business of giving gyaan to the people on social things in life. 

Sell your products right, without increasing price and adding discount later. Does that require being bold? I dont think so. Uh why are most comments talking about the Myntra app?  Lesbianism is okay.... but homosexuality is a crime under Indian Laws. Indian laws discriminate against Men, even transgenders. We are living in anti-men society.",2015-06-11 17:07:56

I'm confused about the taxes?

Basically, I will have my own website and write content, and promote products. Most of my traffic will come from outside India. I'll get commissions from the US company Amazon, in the form of cheque payments. Am I liable for both income tax and GST? And what else? Do I need to register myself somewhere?",jk1121," Yes you will fall right along with freelancers
You need to pay gst then file for a refund  Payments in any foreign currency will come under export category on which IGST is applicable even for Rs 100 so you will have to register for GST  Our CA told me that we could fetch a bank guarantee and that would allow us to not file and pay every month. That can be an annual process. So that's what I'm in the process of doing right now. 

I would say talk to your CA. I don't do affiliate marketing, but I get my payments in USD to my bank account, it's a similar situation. You definitely have to pay income tax. I don't know about GST sorry.

Edit: Likely scenario is that if you sell via Amazon India, then Amazon will handle GST for you. If you sell via Amazon International then may be GST does not apply. Best to check with a CA - though most of them are as of now confused and don't have clarity on it either. I am in the exact same position as yours.. I haven't sorted the GST thing... How do you do your income tax returns.  How did you become an affiliate? Check with a CA dont pay tax directly and ask for refund. CA knows this better.  [deleted] in same train :p

How do I get him to come back?,18,69lt9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/69lt9v/non_political_year_old_cat_ran_away_how_do_i_get/,19,"I'm on vacation and left my cat with the neighbours. It has always been an indoor cat, and is shit scared of the outside world and everything beyond the main door. The neighbours say it escaped out of the blue. They tried searching but in vain. How do I get my cat back?
Update :D",Vickythiside," You could probably keep its kitty litter outside and hope it comes back. Put flyers outside may be. I grew up with a cat who lived for 25 years, and have also had neighbors who have had, and have cats. So I'm assuming I know a thing or two about cats.

Firstly you cat give zero fucks about your neighbor and might have wanted to GTFO from their home as soon as you left it there. You basically put it outside it's comfort zone. So kitteh dear would not want to be there. Cats are also hunters, so kitteh might be hunting and roaming the neighborhood for a few days.

The key here is that you need to be back home, and kitteh needs to know that it's slave (yeah cats own you) us back and it's territory is no more blocked.

I wish you luck. And all I can say is that your meow will be back. Also depends where you stay. If it is some busy tier 1 city, your meow might be a kabab right now. Don't leave your pussy with neighbors man !  If it's a male cat, they are notoriously difficult to keep them at home once they reach puberty. He is gonna be out trying to score some pussy. If you are lucky he may come back 3 to 4 days later depending on how successful he is at getting laid. I have a Tomcat and you can't keep that fucker at home for more than 2 days and I live in a fucking 21 floor tower. He leaves the home on his home and comes back home after 2 to 3 days on his own.  keep some milk near the window Your post does not have any flair and will soon be removed if it remains so.

I'm a South Indian male in Maharashtra and I have applied to Christ College in Banglore (which happens to be my native place, sort of) for a triple major programme (BA PSEng and PSEco) and my interview is on the 13th of May. Now, this is the only place where I applied, so not getting in will be difficult even though I'm quite confident that I'll get in.

I come from a reputed school and junior college (Smt. Sulochanadevi Singhania School) with what I consider sub-par marks (64% average in 11th, which is the marksheet I had to submit) and I need some help with this interview, especially from someone who has hopefully gone through the same process before.

Now I don't know anything at all about interviews and I have many questions (how ironic) and I'll be very grateful to have them answered. My questions mainly revolve around a general interview and not ""what questions do they ask"" or something like that. The things that I am sure I have covered are my attire and myself. However, there are things that I doubt very largely.

.


What am I supposed to bring to this sort of interview?

.


If I'm supposed to bring a Portfolio, what should that contain? In what format? I'm absolutely clueless.

.


On a scale of 1 to 10, how much can I ""brag""? 1 being ""I am educated"" and 10 being listing all my talents, anything I have ever achieved in life, proficiency in Premiere Pro and Photoshop, etc.

.


How do I convey that I am more than that piece of paper? How much should I keep to myself?

.


I'm not too artsy, so how fancy should my portfolio look? Is a simple, plain, printed text sheet enough? (I'm really good at editing though, so I can handle digital stuff well)

.


How much weightage do my board marks carry? I scored well in 10th and stayed afloat in 11th and 12th. I'm hoping that my 12th boards will be reflective of my intellectual value, so I'd also like to know which standard is looked at more specifically or if it's looked at as a learning curve.

I might ask more questions later, so I'd love it if you could answer. Nonetheless, thank you so much for reading this anyway.",DaPompousWiz," * The application form should contain the list of documents you should be carrying.
* Don't brag. Instead, showcase all your skills and talents. Your job is to show how an admission in their college will help you hone your talents and help you towards your goals. So, show off your best Photoshop/Premiere artworks/designs
* As fancy as you can defend in front of the panel

I'm a north Indian but I've been in and around chennai/bangalore for past few years. Overall, I've come across plenty of people holding onto a rather extreme image of the ""north/south people"" on both sides. 
In my personal biased opinion, chennai had been a bad experience on that front. Bangalore and pondicherry have been rather good comparably. I want to see what your views are...",TimeStopsInside," [deleted] My parents are Malayalees, I was born & raised in Bhopal. I can't write/speak Malayalam & I think I am more like north Indians than south Indians.

- North Indians are disproportionately *proud* of their culture, their history, their food & their language. OK, those things are not so bad, but FFS, stop assuming everyone else's religion/culture/history/food/language is worse than yours & stop trying to expect everyone else to put up with it.

- South Indians think they are more their  religion/culture/history/food/language is the best, they won't impose it on you, because think non-South Indians are not intelligent/cultured enough to appreciate it. i was born and broughtup in Jammu (can't go a lot more north than that) and am currently in Bangalore for an internship, have visited chennai, mumbai and stayed in Goa for a month for another internship last year.

I honestly don't see any difference apart from language, i am not being politically correct but people are exactly the same everywhere, Rajasthan, UP, Punjab, Delhi, etc.

if you understand their language and the different customs there is no difference. btata -> alu or po-tae-too -> po-taa-too As a northie, southies for me are:

1) Mostly Polite.

2) Less likely to take pride in being an ass.

3) Peculiar/curious habits regarding food. Like having rice for breakfast. is impossible for me. 

4) Disgusting porn. Most Indian porn is shit anyway.



I haven't lived in any southern state and impression is from various people I've met till now.

 What are people from Goa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Assam? North Indians or south Indians? My North-South experience is mostly shaped by me being a NRI Guju who had South Indian roommates and friends at my American university

- South Indians are very humble and polite. Even the Southie party types are somehow modest about it, lol. I knew of exactly one douchebag Southie in college. All the pompous irresponsible d-bags were North Indian.
- At the same time, certain South Indians can be extremely arrogant about their perceived superiority. This was the case with my main roommate, A Tamilian, who considered everything outside the very South to be ""North India"". He thought North Indians were scum for their eagerness to be ""white"". He thought of North Indians as white people basically while South Indians are the true Indians who came directly from Africa. He hated North Indians for their lighter skin, big noses and considered South Indians' darkness to be a virtue.
- I actually agree with some of those thoughts. I think North India is inferior in many respects (education, morality, proportional advances made for India). I do think North Indians are excessively obsessed with being seen as modern by the West. *Grabs popcorn* Northeast feels neglected again.  Disconnect happens when one is too stringent with their own customs and language. 

If you are making effort to learn about each other, one does not see disconnect just the varying of degrees/levels of customs. 

I'm from the east... Have friends from J&K to Kanyakumari and Arunachal Pradesh to Gujarat. Few are lurking here right now.

Sorry about your bad experience in Chennai the language barrier does bring in some ugly side of the city but trust me it is in general a lovely place if you discount the heat. Basic Tamil (Tamizl) is easy to pick up. get that under your belt and you will see the difference.

Bangalore has always been multicultural. It was a retirement destination of Army guys. Damn cultured though deteriorating now. Tempers are down because of the weather unlike Chennai :)

Love both the places for different reasons.   Bring on the hate Where is /u/maderchodlungibaaz? i find northies cool. i just dont understand why they dont wear lungi I had a big rant. But after reading what I had written I think it's better I don't post it :( I realize that I haven't interacted on a personal level with any North Indian before to make any kind of call.

But an interesting incident happened to my parents. They had gone to Punjab (forget which city) and asked around for a place to stay. Immediately the Sikh maama invited my parents to stay in their home. More like forcefully insisted. My parents were really touched. Except for one niggle. Apparently the family had this little servant-girl they constantly shouted at. People in TN at least are very vocal about their rights and the servants here brook no disrespect. My parents, on returning to Chennai, sent the Punjabi family a Kancheepuram silk dress. Jerks gonna be jerks; there ain't no north-south divide for that.  I was once Driving in Himachal and was overtaking on a single lane road. a guy hanging from a tempo coming from opposite side yelled .. ""Delhi vall hai Delhi valla""  Apparently he could pick up where I was from  even thought I was driving a car with Himachal no plate, just buy watching my driving style( which I am not now very proud of now) I figure highly insulated/inbred northie or southie tend to run into issues. 
Some exposure and mental acceptance makes either much better to be around. 
That said, you are more likely to meet an insular northie, than corresponding southie simply due to force of numbers.  Weekly Paratha-Butter Chicken vs Idly-Sambhar thread.

Weekly Big B vs Thalaiva thread. I am north indian, who has many south indian ""friends"". I have many other friends from various parts of the country, mainly because I lived in a hostel, which had people from all over the country. While I know, many north indians, tend to have some stereotypical image of south indians, and vice versa, I for one, always avoided acting on any such impulses, and tried my best treating everyone, for who they are. But boy, i was wrong!!. I dont want to be diplomatic here, But really, south indians hate north indians. They dont even want to make an effort to move out and socialise with people from other places. Language is a barrier, but I can cut them some slack there, because they say they are most comfortable in their own languages. But really, in my current group, i am the only north indian, with a group of kannada people. And they cant stop trying to put me down, at any instance possible. This is not a unique experience. They are unobjective, and they think their values are the ones that should be abided by everyone else. They refuse to make a slightest change in their understanding in trying to understand a different person.

The only south indian good friends that I have, are the ones, who for the most part, havent lived there. I know you can say the same about north indians as well. But well, I am just ranting about my experience here, Well, I can't figure out why there are almost no northie guys getting roles as heroes but almost every other heroines are of northern origin in southern movies. Why?  Naan prod Punjabi Kannadiga saar.  I think South Indians are too meek. But they are polite too. 

Other than that they are as much jerks as all Indians.

OP you should have started with your experiences. As an ABCD, I just find all of this so ridiculous and hilarious. Here in the States, I consider my Indian friends as ""Indian"" and don't look at their last names, what states they are from, etc. This is probably one of the biggest reasons there's so much of a disconnect in the country between different people.

EDIT: I should clarify that i'm commenting on the negative comments below on this thread that are being blatantly rude. They have been heavily downvoted and the language they speak in is rather repulsive. i'm commenting on that..I should have been more clear about that so i'm sorry. However, I'm also bringing in my justification of the understanding I have about all this in the chain of responses. I hate your food. Sorry but everytime I try a Dosa I can't have any more than one bite. Even Chicken Chettinad doesn't go down well. And your papad is just weird.

That sums up my opinion of the southern cultures [removed] On behalf of my telugu friend-north indians are very selfish except punjabis. Chennai sux, most of the south indian cities suck. I can vouch for it.


PS: I am a south indian by birth shish :| Raised for several years in Delhi, people genetically 'South Indian' but brought up there are 'North Indian' in every way apart from color and maybe genetic propensity to different diseases. 

At a high level South Indians are more risk averse and prudent. North Indians especially those who come from regions which have seen lot of war in past ( Punjab, Kashmir) have much higher propensity for taking risk. This actually defines lot of other behavior you see and sterotypes you have about either.  Black color ; nariyal waley. They mix all their food on a leaf and eat with their hands. The same hands that they scratched their balls with.  Cmon when u mix sambar rasam chutney together then how can u enjoy the taste of each.rofl. 

To be honest; there black complexion is a turn off for fairness crazed north. I feel this is wrong as north indians are also not true white in compared to european. But defintly far fairer than a madrasi.

Ah south of goa is all madras. We dont know tamil telugu mallu kanada ltte etc. All are madrasis who wear lungi and have fat actors dancing there bellies.

I know they are brainy but are considered as untouchables due to there color here in north and lack of hindi. No one gives a fuck for brain. Its all brawn for northies. I saw my neoghbour boastfuly saying that he will never allow a south india touch his car as a cleaner because it will becpme dirty...i was like wtf!!

I might sound rude; but that is the general perception .  

And wait lack of hindi is considered them to be lack of nationalism. I know for sure; the madrasi coming north will have a hell of a time here than vice versa. God forbid' if his car touches someones car on bisy delhi road....khallass!!",2014-07-08 07:03:23

In fact, many [Islamic Scholars](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Nationalism+is+haram&ie) consider Nationalism to be _haram_ 


>One of these poisonous concepts that stigmatises the Prophet's (saws) Ummah is Nationalism. It is a dangerous concept that has become the emotional basis for the state of the Ummah today and one, which visibly fortifies the division among those who profess to believe in the same ideology. Furthermore, the Muslims identify themselves as Turkish, Arab, African and Pakistani. If this is not enough, Muslims are further sub-divided within each country or continent. For example, in Pakistan people are classed as Punjabis, Sindhis, Balauchis and Pathans. This fragmentation continues to gain momentum amongst the Muslims. 

 Certainly there would be people who would accept that considering we have likes of Indian mujahideen, SIMI functional in india. 

Muslim religion is made such that it is intolerant of all other religions and all other systems, for obvious reasons .
A muslim who wants to stay muslim will have to accept caliphate because he cannot be disloyal to his religion.

India: How a rich nation became poor and will be rich again

Essays¬†| March 19, 2007 - 12:38

(Developing Cultures : Case Studies, co-edited by Peter Berger and Laurence Harrison, Routledge, 2005.)

Does 'culture' in some way help to explain the fact that the same Indian economy that was stagnating for the first fifty years of the 20th century began to grow at a respectable clip after 1980 and was amongst the fastest growing in the world by the end of the century?

Consider the following hundred year trend: between 1900 and 1950, the Indian economy grew on the average 0.8 percent a year; but the population also grew at about the same rate; thus, net growth in income per capita was nil and we rightly called our colonial economy stagnant. After Independence, economic growth picked up to 3.5 percent between 1950 and 1980, but so did population growth (to 2.2 percent); hence the net affect on income was 1.3 percent per capita, and this is what we mournfully referred to as ‚Äúthe Hindu rate of growth.‚Äù Things began to change with modest liberalization in the eighties when annual economic growth rose to 5.6 percent. This happy trend continued in the reform decade of the nineties when growth averaged 6.2 percent a year, while population slowed to 1.8 percent; thus, per capita income rose by a decent 4.4 percent a year.

As a benchmark, recall that the West's industrial revolution took place at a 3 percent GDP growth and 1.1 percent per capita income growth after 1820. To appreciate the magnitude of the Indian change after 1980, let me illustrate: If India's per capita GDP had continued growing at the pre-1980 level, then its income would have reached present American capita income levels only by 2250; but if it continues to grow at the post-1980 rate then it will reach those levels by 2066: a gain of 184 years!

How does one begin to explain India's economic performance over the past hundred years? The Indian nationalist blames the first fifty years' stagnation on British colonialism. But a trade economist will counter this by showing that the world economy was also stagnant in the first half of the 20th century (especially after World War I) when world per capita GDP grew annually at just under one percent.2¬†The main culprits, he would say, were conflict and autarky. Disgraceful protectionism by most governments between the Wars slowed both the world and the Indian economy.

Although the Indian economy picked up after 1950, the neoclassical economist would argue that it performed below the world economy, which experienced a ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù driven by trade expansion until 1971. Like the rest of the Third World India did not benefit from global trade expansion because it had closed its economy and pursued 'import substitution'. Moreover, Nehru's socialism had shackled the economy with fierce controls on the private sector, pejoratively called 'Licence Raj'; hence its annual GDP growth was 1.5 percentage points below even the Third World average between 1950 and 1980.3

This changed dramatically with modest liberal reforms in the 1980s and more sweeping ones in the 1990s as the Indian economy integrated with the world. In those twenty years it not only outperformed the world economy significantly but it was amongst the fastest in the world.4¬†Thus, gradual technological diffusion, rising capital accumulation and productivity, and gradual education expansion help economists to explain a good deal of the story. There is also the value of time and accumulated learning through time. ‚ÄúCollective learning‚Äù is Hayek's term, and he applied it to the cumulative experience that generations build up which is embodied in the language, the technology, and the way of doing things.5

But economic explanations are not enough. That India adopted democracy in 1950 before capitalism (in 1991) is also significant because democracy's redistributive pressures, such as free power to farmers and other subsidies, have dampened growth and also explain why India's reform process has been so painfully slow. Economists also find it puzzling why the liberal institutions of the British Raj did not engender faster growth during the colonial years. The rule of law, the relative peace of Pax Brittanica, a non-dirigiste administration, the railways and canals‚Äîall these were market friendly moves, after all.

I believe that national confidence also plays an important role. The more damaging impact of colonialism may well have been to Indian minds‚Äîit created an inferiority complex from which they have only recently recovered. Douglass North has rightly emphasized the importance of beliefs.6Businessmen understand the value of confidence in entrepreneurial success and in creating a climate for investment; Historians too emphasize the power of self-belief in national success--Roman history and Britain's rise in the 19th century are examples of this. After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose, especially as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism damaged that confidence. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, confidence returned and young Indian minds finally became decolonized. I traveled extensively across India in the 1990's when I discovered this changed mood, and I think it also explains the current economic success.7

I shall now amplify my arguments by taking the reader on a galloping tour of Indian economic history. From this story I shall draw lessons about the role of institutions and culture in development. En passant, I shall touch upon the great questions of Indian history: did the British impoverish India? Why didn't the railways engender an industrial revolution? Did Nehru's socialism dampen India's progress? What is the consequence of democracy preceding capitalism?

Let's begin with the Mughals

India's nationalist historians have portrayed its pre-colonial economy as a golden age of prosperity, and this fabulous wealth set the Europeans on their great voyages of discovery.8¬†During the Mughal Empire at the end of the 16th century, India's wealth did indeed sustain more than 100 million people. With plenty of arable land, its agriculture was certainly as productive as Western Europe's, and even the subsistence-oriented peasant got a decent return.9¬†India also had a large, skilled workforce that produced not only cotton but also luxuries for the aristocracy. Consequently, the economy produced a large financial surplus, which was used to support the growing Mughal Empire and finance spectacular monuments like the Taj Mahal.10

In 1497, the Portuguese sent Vasco da Gama with a flotilla of four ships to find India's wealth. But the two-year voyage was not a commercial success and the Indians were not interested in European clothes and goods for they made far ones in India. But Da Gama told King Manuel of Portugal of large cities, large buildings and rivers, and great populations. He spoke about spices and jewels, precious stones and ‚Äúmines of gold.‚Äù He believed that he had found India's legendary wealth.11

It took the English a hundred years to discover this wealth. Initially, they came to plunder but soon discovered the rewards of trade. They found that India produced the world's best cotton yarn and textiles and in enormous quantities.12¬†What the Indians wanted in exchange from the Europeans was gold and silver, for which they had an insatiable appetite. Hence, there was a constant flow of gold to India, which absorbed a good deal of the bullion mined by the Spaniards in the New World. Having learned about cotton textiles from India, the English turned the tables, and brought an industrial revolution to Britain, but destroyed the lives of millions of Indian weavers.

India was a leading manufacturer in the 18th century

India was a leading manufacturing country in the world in the early 18th century. It had 22.6 percent share of the world's GDP, which came down to around 16 percent by 1820, closer to its share of world population.13¬†It had a developed banking system and vigorous merchant capital, with a network of agents, brokers and middlemen. Given the enormous financial surplus, a skilled artisan class, large exports, plenty of arable land and reasonable productivity, the question is why didn't a modern industrial economy emerge in India? Instead, why did India become impoverished?

Despite a dynamic and a growing commercial sector which responded to market forces and extensive foreign trade, the truth is that 18th century India was significantly behind Western Europe in technology, institutions and ideas. Neither an agricultural revolution, nor a scientific revolution had occurred, and in the long run the manual skill of the Indian artisan could be no substitute for technological progress,‚Äù14¬†and this would have needed new attitudes. Notwithstanding the surplus and the trade, mid-eighteenth India had a ‚Äúper capita product perhaps two-thirds of that in England and France.‚Äù15

There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor. One explanation is that even in the 18th century India had a large population and plenty of cheap labor. Prosperity comes with rising productivity and a rise in productivity depends on technology. When the supply of labor is elastic, it is more economical to hire people than to invest in machines. Hence, an Englishman observed in 1807, ‚ÄúIn India it is seldom that an attempt is made to accomplish anything by machinery that can be performed by human labour.‚Äù16¬†There is no easy answer to the problem that the country was prosperous and the people were poor.

Did the British Raj impoverish India?

India's nationalist historians have blamed the British Raj for India's poverty. The classic nationalist case is that India had been rich before the British came and colonialism weakened agriculture and ‚Äúdeindustrialized‚Äù India, throwing millions of artisans out of work. Britain's trade policies encouraged the import of manufactures and the export of raw materials; finally, it drained the wealth of India by transferring its capital to Britain.

Nationalists claimed that Lancashire's new textile mills crushed India's handloom textile industry and threw millions of weavers out of work. India's textile exports plunged from a leadership position before the start of the Britain's Industrial Revolution to a fraction. The indigenous banking system, which financed these exports, was also destroyed. Since the colonial government did not erect tariff barriers, Indian consumers shifted to cheaper English mill-made cloth and millions of handloom workers where left in misery. British colonial rule ‚Äúde-industrialised‚Äù India (a favorite nationalist phrase) and from an exporter of textiles, India became an exporter of raw cotton.17

Britain also changed the old land revenue system to the disadvantage of the farmer, who had to now pay revenue whether or not the monsoon failed. This led to famines. The worst one in 1896-97 affected 96 million lives and killed an estimated 5 million people. Although the railways helped in the trade of food crops, the enlarged national market sucked away the peasant's surplus, which he had earlier stored for the bad years. Moreover, the British government transferred its surplus revenues back to England. Since India consistently exported more then she imported in the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century, Britain used India's trade surplus to finance her own trade deficit with the rest of the world, to pay for her exports to India, and for capital repayments in London. This represented a massive drain of India's wealth.18

In recent years some historians have challenged this nationalist picture. They have argued that Indian industry's decline in the 19th century was caused by technology. The machines of Britain's industrial revolution wiped out Indian textiles, in the same way that traditional handmade textiles disappeared in Europe and the rest of the world. Fifty years later Indian textile mills would have destroyed them. India's weavers were, thus, the victims of technological obsolescence.19

They also found that the land tax had not been exorbitant‚Äîby 1900 it was only 5 percent of the agricultural output or half the average per capita tax burden. There had been a ‚Äúdrain of wealth‚Äù, but it was only about 1.5 percent of GNP every year. The revisionist historians argued that India's payments to Britain were for real military and civilian services and to service capital investments. Also, the overhead cost of the British establishment‚Äîthe so called ‚Äúhome charges‚Äù‚Äîwas in fact quite small.20¬†If India had its own army and navy it would have spent more. True, India did have a balance of payments surplus, which Britain used to finance part of her deficit, but India was compensated by the import of gold and silver that went into private Indian hands.

India begins to re-industrize

Indian entrepreneurs began to set up their own modern textile mills after 1850 and very slowly began to recapture the domestic market. In 1896, Indian mills supplied 8% of the total cloth consumed in India; in 1913, 20%; in 1936, 62%; and by 1945, 76%.21Although India did not participate in global trade expansion between 1870 and 1913, Indian businessmen made large profits during the First World War, which they reinvested in after the war. Thus, India's manufacturing output grew 5.6 percent per year between 1913-38, well above the world average of 3.3 percent.‚Äù¬†22¬†The British government finally provided tariff protection from the 1920s, which helped industrialists to expand and diversify.

By Independence in 1947, Indian entrepreneurs were strong and in a position to buy out the businesses of the departing British. Industry's share in India's GNP had doubled from 3.8 percent (in 1913) to 7.5 percent (in 1947), and the share of manufactures in her exports rose from 22.4 percent (in 1913) to 30 percent (in 1947).

Why didn't an industrial revolution occur?

One of the intriguing questions of history is why India failed to create an industrial revolution. Karl Marx predicted that the railways would transform India and usher in an industrial revolution. Indeed, by the First World War, some thought that it was ready to take-off. By 1914, India had the third largest railway network, the world's largest jute manufacturing industry, the fourth largest cotton textile industry, the largest canal system, and 2.5 percent of world trade.23Although a colony, it had a very liberal regulatory regime--far more investor friendly than the one that replaced it after Independence‚Äîand after the 1920s the infant industry was also favored by tariffs. It had a merchant class hungry to become industrialists. Industrialization did, in fact, pick up after the War and industry's share in national output doubled. But it was not enough to broadly transform an agricultural society. Modern industry employed only 2.5 million people out of population of 350 million.

Amiya Kumar Bagchi, the Marxist economist, suggests that the reason was the lack of effective demand during the colonial period, and this limited business opportunity. Indians were just too poor to buy modern goods and services.24¬†If the domestic Indian market was small, couldn't the entrepreneur have supplemented it by producing for export? Morris D. Morris, blames supply constraints.25¬†An Indian entrepreneur was uncompetitive because of a shortage of technology, skilled labor, and capital‚Äîall of which raised his cost of his production. The historian, Rajat Ray, argues that Indian businessmen did not export because they made inferior products, unacceptable to the world market. In his view, technological backwardness was the single biggest failing.26¬†But surely, they could have imported technology, as Jamshedji Tata, G.D. Birla, and others did.

Unlike nationalist historians, I do not think there was a British conspiracy to deliberately under-invest in India or sabotage Indian business interests. Bombay's textile mills were built with the credit, technical assistance and machines from Britain although they were a competitive threat to the Manchester's mills. I believe the industrial revolution did not occur because Indian agriculture remained stagnant, and you cannot have an industrial revolution without an agricultural surplus or the means to feed a rapidly growing urban population; second, the international trading environment turned hostile with protectionism after the First World War, followed by the Depression; third, the colonial government did not educate the masses, unlike the Japanese state; finally, a colonial mindset pervaded the Indian middle class--even the hardiest potential entrepreneur lacks confidence when he is politically enslaved.

What is the verdict on British rule?

Did the British impoverish India? There is no question that in the 18th century it plundered and looted India's wealth, as all conquerors have done in history. But did it create on-going institutions that were to India's detriment? This has to do with the nature and theory of colonialism. True, its Industrial Revolution threw millions of weavers out of work, but it would have happened any way when the new technology reached India. British government policy could have cushioned the impact by erecting trade barriers and saved enormous amount of human suffering, but protecting handlooms would have been a temporary palliative.

Odd as it may seem, I believe that Britain did not ‚Äúexploit‚Äù India enough. Had it made the massive investments in India that it did in the Americas, India would have become more prosperous and a much bigger market for British goods. A richer India would have been a better customer, a better supplier, and a firmer basis of Empire.27¬†Britain's main failure was not to educate the Indian masses‚Äîhence 83 percent of Indians were illiterate at Independence. Britain's education system in India produced only a thin upper crust of extremely well educated Indians, while the masses remained illiterate.28

Although Britain could not lift Indians out of poverty, nor avert famines, it did give India the institutions of democracy--the rule of law, an independent judiciary and a free press. It built railways, canals, and harbors. It gave India almost a hundred years of peace‚Äîthe Pax Britannica. Although it gave modern values and institutions, it did not interfere with its ancient traditions and religion. Hence, India has preserved its spiritual heritage and the old way of life continues. Many despair over the divisiveness of caste, but the hold of the Indian way of life is also a bulwark against the onslaught of the global culture.

Independence and 'License Raj'

After Independence, democracy took root in India and gradually the masses acquired a stake in the system, periodically electing representatives even from the lowest castes. The rulers also adopted a Fabian socialist economic path, and Indians did not turn to capitalism until 1991, although there was modest liberalization of the economy in the 1980s. Thus, India embraced democracy before capitalism, which makes its journey to modernity unique and explains a good deal.

Jawaharlal Nehru and his planners did not trust private entrepreneurs; so they made the state the entrepreneur, and not surprisingly, they failed to create an industrial revolution. Instead, India experienced an agricultural revolution in the early 1970s. It thus had an important pre-condition for the industrial revolution‚Äîan agricultural surplus‚Äîbut the industrial take-off eluded it. Its investment rate also rose from 6 percent to well over 20 per cent, and yet it did not engender a take-off. Why?

I think there were at least six things wrong with India's mantra: one, it adopted an inward-looking, import-substituting path rather than an outward-looking, export-promoting route; it thus denied itself a share in world trade and the prosperity that trade brought in the post-War era. Two, it set up a massive, inefficient, and monopolistic public sector to which it denied autonomy of working; hence, its investments were not productive and it had a poor capital-output ratio. Three, it over-regulated private enterprise with the worst controls in the world, and this diminished competition in the market; four, it discouraged foreign capital and denied itself the benefits of technology and world class competition. Five, it pampered organized labor to the point that it has extremely low productivity. Six, it ignored the education of its children.

Nehru's strategic planner, P.C. Mahalanobis, made two wrong assumptions. He assumed that there were no opportunities for rapid export expansion in the 1950s, and this turned out to be wrong. India discovered that tiny Hong Kong could earn more from its exports than the whole of India, as India's share of world trade declined from 2.2 percent in 1947 to 0.5 percent in 1990. He also assumed that competition was wasteful, and this was also a flawed idea because there can be little improvement in productivity without it.

Even more damaging were the creeping controls on the private sector. The most bizarre was the licensing system. It began with the Industrial Licensing Act of 1951, which required an entrepreneur to get a license to set up a new unit, to expand it, or change the product mix. A huge number of untrained clerks, engineers, bureaucrats at the Directorate General of Technical Development, operating on the basis of inadequate information vetted thousands of applications on an ad hoc basis. These low level functionaries took months in the futile, micro-review of an application and finally sent it for approval to the administrative ministry. The ministry again lost months reviewing the same data before it sent the application to an inter-ministerial licensing committee. After the Minister's approval, the investor had to seek approval for the import of machinery from the capital goods licensing committee. If finance was needed from a State financial institution, the same scrutiny had to be repeated afresh. The result was enormous delays, sometimes lasting years with staggering opportunities for corruption.

Large business houses set up parallel bureaucracies in Delhi, to follow up on their files, organize bribes, and win licenses. If the entrepreneur did finally get started and made a success of his enterprise, he was again in trouble. It was an offence punishable under the law to manufacture beyond the capacity granted by the license. India became the only country in the world where the production of sorely needed goods sorely was punishable by law.29

The system ended in thwarting competition, entrepreneurship and growth, without achieving any of its social objectives. It fostered monopolies and it proliferated uneconomic-size plants in remote, uncompetitive locations, employing second-rate technology. Bureaucrats who did not have a clue about the basics of running a business made the decisions on the choice of technology, the size and location of plants.

Although it was becoming clear that India was on the wrong path by the late sixties, instead of changing course after Nehru, Indira Gandhi introduced more controls. She nationalized banks, discouraged foreign investment, and placed more hurdles before domestic enterprise. Hence, industrial growth plunged from 7.7 per cent a year between 1951-1965 to 4.0 per cent between 1966-1980. Productivity of Indian manufacturing declined half a percent a year from 1960 to 1985.30

‚Äú1966-1980 is effectively the dark period for the Indian economy.‚Äù31. It is harder to blame Nehru for adopting the economic wrong model for socialism was the wisdom of his age and dozens of economists visited India and hailed his bold experiment.32¬†It is right to blame Indira Gandhi, for by then Japan's miracle was evident, and Korea and Taiwan were following its footsteps. However, ideology is only one part of the story. An important reason for non-performance was poor implementation. Even Nehru's socialism could have delivered more and did not have to degenerate into ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù.

India after the Reforms

Although there was modest liberalization in the 1980s, the decisive turning point came in July 1991 when the minority government of Narasimha Rao announced sweeping reforms. It opened the economy to foreign investment and trade; it dismantled import controls, lowered customs duties, devalued the currency and made the rupee convertible on the trade account; it virtually abolished licensing controls on private investment, dropped tax rates and broke public sector monopolies. As a result growth rose to 7.5 percent a year for three years in a row in the mid-nineties, inflation came down from 13 percent to 6 percent by 1993, exchange reserves shot up from $1 billion to $20 billion by 1993, and had crossed $100 billion by end 2003. This was as important a turning point as Deng's revolution in China in December 1978. Surprisingly, the elected coalition governments that succeeded Rao continued the reform process, and despite its slow, incremental pace, it has made India one of the fastest growing major economies in the world.33

Indians have traditionally not accorded a high place to making money. Hence, the merchant or bania is placed third in the four-caste hierarchy, behind the brahmin and the kshatriya, and only a step ahead of the laboring shudra. After the economic reforms making money became increasingly respectable and the sons of brahmins and kshatriyas began to get MBAs and wanted to become entrepreneurs. The business pages of newspapers became livelier; chief ministers in the states scrambled for private investment; judges became more even-handed in industrial disputes. As a result, India is in the midst of a social revolution rivalled, perhaps, only by the ascent of Japan's merchant class during the 1968 Meiji Restoration.

There has also been mental revolution. And a changed attitude to English illustrates this new mindset. Ever since the British left Indians constantly carped against the English language. But in the 1990s this carping seemed to die, and quietly, without ceremony English became one of the Indian languages. English lost its colonial stigma, oddly enough, around the time that the Hindu nationalists came to power. Young Indians in the new middle class think of English as a skill, like Windows. This is why Hinglish (Hindi mixed with English) is spreading. Encouraged by flourishing private television channels and supported by their advertisers, the newly emerging middle classes avidly embrace this uninhibited hybrid of Hindi and English, and this popular idiom of the bazaar is rushing down the socio-economic ladder. The purists naturally disapprove, but people are more comfortable and accepting of it today because Indians are more relaxed and confident as a people. Their minds have become decolonized.

The world, meanwhile, also changed from an industrial to the information economy, and it seemed to speak to India's advantage, symbolized by its success in software and business process outsourcing. These ‚ÄúBangalores‚Äù have given Indians confidence and they reflect a new social contract. The new entrepreneurs did not inherit wealth; they have risen on the back of their talent, hard work, and professional skills. A new self-belief has emerged among urban youth that doesn't need approval from others, especially from the West. Music composers like A.R. Rehman display an exuberant nonchalance, as do the new young Bollywood pop stars. So do new fiction writers like Arundhati Roy, designers of fashion clothes, beauty queens and cricket stars.

Some lessons

Neoclassical economic theory explains a great deal about why the Indian economy that was stagnating in the first half of the 20th century went on to become one of the fastest growing by the end of the century. It tells us, for example, that disgraceful protectionism by governments in the inter-war years in the first half of the 20th century dampened world trade and slowed down the world and the Indian economies. It also explains why India performed below the world average between 1950-1980: thinking that trade had impoverished her in the colonial period, India closed its economy and denied itself the fruits of a ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù in world trade between 1950 and 1970; ‚ÄúLicense Raj‚Äù and other institutions of Nehru's socialism also suppressed growth. Finally, neoclassical economics explains how by dismantling controls and integrating the economy with the global economy, the Indian economy has become more competitive and is growing rapidly after the reforms.

But this is not the whole story, and we must turn to institutions and attitudes to understand the incentive structure of the Indian society.60 Indians blame colonialism for impoverishing them. But we have seen that colonialism is a more complex tale. For example, it did not 'de-industrialize' India as the nationalists argued; handloom textiles died in India (and the world) because of technological obsolescence. Colonialism's bigger damage was to the loss of Indian confidence, which inhibited Indian entrepreneurs. This confidence began to grow with Gandhi's freedom movement in the first half of the 20th century, and industrialization did pick up. However, its impact on society was insufficient to create an industrial revolution.

After Independence, India's confidence certainly rose as democracy took root, but flawed economic institutions of Nehruvian socialism acted as a damper. Once these socialist institutions began to be replaced by capitalist ones in the Reform period, self-assurance returned to the Indian marketplace. Today's mood in India is opposite to what existed a hundred years ago. Insecurity and inferiority filled colonial India, which is all too apparent in the writings of Bengali writers of the 19th century, such as Bankim Chandra Chatterji. Today, writers like Salman Rushdie and Arundhati Roy exhibit a matter of fact assuredness (almost a cool) that is a reflection of changed national mindset.

India embraced democracy first and capitalism afterwards and this has made a difference. India became a full-fledged democracy in 1950, with universal suffrage and extensive human rights, but it was not until 1991 that it opened up to the free play of market forces. For the rest of the world it has been the other way around. In the West, suffrage was extended gradually in the last century, and as mass political parties developed, democracy began to impinge on capitalist institutions and practices.

India's democracy has an overwhelming majority of poor voters--70 per cent still live in rural areas; organized labor constitutes less than 10 per cent of total labor; and the middle class is around 20 per cent of the population. Because of democratic pressures, India tried to redistribute the pie before it was baked. It set up intricate regulatory networks before the private economy had transformed a rural into an industrial society. It began to think in terms of ‚Äúwelfare‚Äù before there were welfare-generating jobs. The result, as we have seen, was a throttling of enterprise, slow growth, and missed opportunities. It is the price India has paid for having democracy before capitalism‚Äîor rather too much democracy and not enough capitalism.

Since politics is a short run game and growth is a long run one there will never be a situation that is completely optimal. This explains why Indian politicians do not bother about education because results take a long time to come. When a politician promises rice for two rupees a kilo when it costs five rupees in the market, he wins the election. Since the mid-1960s politicians have vigorously competed in giving away free goods and services to voters. When politicians do that, where is the money to come for creating schools or improving old ones? India's damaging fiscal deficit (around 10 percent of GDP for the center and states combined) is a testimonial to the downside of competitive politics, and it teaches that the demand for publicly provided goods and services is insatiable in a democracy.

But India's problems of governance go far beyond the need to appease interests. The weakening of its democratic institutions since Indira Gandhi in the 1970s has caused widespread corruption, political violence, populist giveaways, and a paralysis of problem solving. Conspicuously absent are disciplined party organizations, which help leaders in other democracies to mobilize support for specific programs. Hence, there is an excessive reliance on the personal appeal of individual leaders to win elections. When in power leaders tend to take the easy way out, which is not to act at all.

Will capitalism, and its cousin globalization succeed in establishing a comfortable place for themselves in India? The answer depends on their ability to deliver prosperity broadly. It also depends on leaders in the government and in business to champion the classic liberal premises of free trade and competition. It needs leaders to come out say that (1) some people will not fare as well in the competitive market place; (2) the winners will far outnumber the losers; (2) capitalist democracy is the best arrangement we have found; (4) globalization is not only a good thing, it is a great leap forward in history. My fear is that capitalism's success in India is threatened not so much by the leftists or protectionists but by the timidity of its defenders.

The curious historic inversion between democracy and capitalism means that India's path into the future is evolving through a daily dialogue between the conservative forces of caste, religion and the village, the leftist and Nehruvian socialist forces which dominated the intellectual life of the country for 40 years, and the new forces of global capitalism. These ‚Äúmillion negotiations of democracy‚Äù slow down the pace of economic reforms, but they also mean that India might have a more stable, peaceful, and negotiated transition into the future than say China. It might also avoid some of the deleterious side effects of an unprepared capitalist society, such as Russia. Although slower, India is more likely to preserve its way of life and it's civilization of diversity, tolerance, and spirituality against the onslaught of the global culture.

Does culture matter?

Cultural explanations have been a vigorous industry in India for more than a hundred years. Colonial officials routinely blamed India's poverty on the otherworldly spirituality of Hindu life and its fatalistic beliefs. Max Weber attributed the absence of development to the caste system. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish economist, found that India's social system and attitudes were an important cause of its ‚Äúlow level equilibrium‚Äù of low productivity, primitive production techniques, and low levels of living.34

Deepak Lal, another economist, similarly explained economic stagnation in a low level ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù around the caste system, which bought stability in the context of political warfare, monsoon failure and climatic uncertainty, labor shortage, and an under-valued merchant class.35¬†David Landes, the historian, blames the enervating heat, which is deleterious to work. For this reason, rich countries lie in temperate zones and the poor in the tropics and semi-tropics.36

While institutions and culture do matter undoubtedly, we are all skeptical of national stereotypes and easy cultural explanations of the sort that were common hundred years ago. In my experience, successful Hindu entrepreneurs can be both extremely otherworldly in religion and aggressive in business. The Indian farmer, despite being caught in the caste system, responds quickly to market based incentives, as the Green Revolution testifies. Brahmins, who are supposed to have contempt for manual labor, will plough their land vigorously if they have to. And Rajput Thakurs, who never worked for a living, will shed their feudal ways for the sake of a commercial opportunity. Moreover, there are substantial non-Hindus in India and these communities had also been stuck in the same rut of stagnation. Other Asian countries were equally backward, but they had no ‚ÄúHindu equilibrium‚Äù to explain away their stagnation. Finally, the same Indians when they migrate to other countries perform better.

Thus, I am uncomfortable with the ‚Äúotherworldly values of the Hindus‚Äù or the ‚Äúimmobilizing effects of the caste system‚Äù and the ‚Äúconservative habits of the merchant caste‚Äù. I believe that Sir John Hicks' Economic Principle does trump in most cases. It states that ‚Äúpeople would act economically; when the opportunity of an advantage was presented to them they would take it.‚Äù37¬†It explains not only the diffusion of the Green Revolution across India but also the demographic transitions currently underway in many states.

When seeking an explanation for a nation's wealth and poverty, my preferred method is to begin with economic factors as proximate causes that motivate a businessman to invest--the size of the market, the capability of suppliers, distribution hurdles, and the state of competition. If this does not satisfy, I seek answers in institutions, some of which are, of course, intimately tied to culture. I have found that institutions can evolve rapidly as incentives change in society and can be transferred fairly quickly; for example, during the 1990s India was able to dismantle many of the institutions of Nehruvian socialism and replace them with capitalist institutions. Finally, if none of these factors provide a satisfactory explanation, then I turn to attitudes and social structure.

I find Deepak Lall's distinction between material and cosmological beliefs useful.38The material beliefs of a civilization are about ways of making a living and are the subject of economics; cosmological ones are about how to live and are in the realm of 'culture'. The rise of the west was accompanied by a change in both sets of beliefs, but East Asia's success has needed mainly a change in material beliefs‚Äîit has become prosperous without losing its soul. In other words, it is possible to modernize without westernizing. Ever since the British Raj material beliefs have been changing in India unlike our cosmological beliefs.

Our continuing inability to distinguish between the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù and the ‚Äúwestern‚Äù in India is surely the cause of some of our grief. If we could only accept that a great deal of modern western culture, especially its material beliefs, are not the West's property, but are a universal, critical way of thinking, which belongs to all rational human beings. We would not waste our energies on swadeshi (protectionism) hindutva (preserving the ancient Hindu civilization), and futile language debates (‚Äúremove English from primary schools‚Äù). The debate between modernisation and westernisation, begun in early nineteenth century by Ram Mohan Roy, continues to rage in India. At the root is a fear of the loss of the Indian way of life. The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.


",unfitforoffice," Wow. TLDR? Wow what a nice read. But there was no mention of famines or partitions. Were they not back-breaking for the economy? [deleted] I don't think thats what Tharoor is really talking about. More from the perspective of:- Hitler is taught to be an ""evil"" guy now. In germany as well. Yet, Britain has mostly whitewashed the horrors they've committed in what they teach to their own kids. Continuing the same stuff.  

IMHO, he's raising awareness about the atrocities that they've committed, and thats something I can get behind. I think Tharoor's main goal is to educate the modern Western masses about some of the harsher realities of colonialism, that they conveniently leave out in their history text books. This was an interesting counter narrative as well. Das essentially wrote the same thing in 'India Unbound'. But I don't think it really contradicts Tharoor's claims . Everyone of Das' arguments are well corroborated in partly being responsible for holding ""India"" back but he let's the Brits go Scott free.

Yes, there were individual entrepreneurial success stories (too few benefited). Yes, the European institutions enabled the industrial revolution and yes, the caste system was responsible. But without a ""Indian"" structural head who could've changed things or we could've had an enlightment (a historical what-if), the colonial masters simply gave  no chance for growth. That carries a lot of culpability. 

The drain theory is definitely true. The EIC was paying 400,000 pounds to the crown since 1765 apart from the ""gifts"" to Parliament all sourced from India. They took advantage of Aurgazeb's tax exemption. The Marathas, Nawab of Awadh and Hyderabad's Nizam all had to pay substantial amounts annually to the French and EIC well before 1857. Asaf-ud-daula paid 7.6 million rupees annually just to be recognised Nawab in 1797. The point is, the money could've been spent on subjects or institutions and maybe we wouldn't be as poor as we are now.

A book came out last year called ""Selling Empire: India in the Making of Britain and America, 1600-1830"" which demonstrates the centrality of India--both as an idea and a place--to the making of a global British imperial system. Essentially, the new world was discovered *because* Columbus was searching for riches in India. 

He makes the argument that in the run-up to the American Revolution, the East India Company played a visible and disturbing role. In his view, Americans‚Äô awareness of the Company‚Äôs conquests in India, and the establishment of an authoritarian government there, evoked the fear of a shared place for Indians and Americans in a corrupt and ‚Äúdespotic‚Äù empire . Following the Revolution, America‚Äôs connection with India paradoxically expanded, as reflected in part by the continuing appeal of Indian consumer fashions. Much of it, however, arose fortuitously out of the extended British wars with France from 1794 onward; as a neutral power, the United States was well situated to take advantage of trading opportunities denied to others. By 1806, India had contributed 4 percent of U.S. imports, and Americans commanded much of the Continental European market for Indian goods. 
 >It gave India almost a hundered years of peace. 

I'm done. I wouldn't call 100+ of looting and injustice ""peaceful."" Have read the whole thing.
The Nehruvian disaster is irrelevant for judging the British period.

Taking information from the article itself, I think we can still blame the British for not letting India join the industrial revolution.

This they did by creating:
Low literacy/education (In a modern economy, this alone will mean that you'll fail to compete.)

Unstable political environment/ low confidence (In an uncertain future, why will anyone invest time and capital.) There is a mention of low self confidence and lack of education being the reason Indians didn't moved toward industrialization. And he also mentioned that Indians had no money to buy anything at that time. Then how after 1947 suddenly things could have changed? Isn't these things require time especially a skills gained after education. I think once a generation of Indian educated enough in 1980's they automatically moved towards the industrialization solely on the basis of there skills. And of course we can't deny the poor government policies but I feel completely blaming them isn't right  a thing. Is there something wrong I have understood from this article? Saved for later. Too long to read right now. Let's just sum it up: The British did many good things and bad things.

Personally I'm glad for stuff like outlawing Sati and reforming personal laws which I'm sure most of our post independence governments wouldn't have the guts to touch. Was India ever a rich nation in the first place? People use the 27% of world GDP stat to justify the label but we had 27% of the world population also at that time. 

Both Shashi Tharoor and Gurcharan Das are starting from the flawed premise that we were a rich nation.  Slightly off topic, but I believe much of Tharoor's British bashing is just shrewd political posturing. When he first ran for parliament in 2009, the Nair community voted for him en masse because ""he is one of us"". The educated/liberal class voted for him because he had the ""it"" factor, undersecretary general of the UN, erudite, sophisticated etc. He won handily, with a huge margin. In 2014, a lot of the older Nairs voted BJP because ""they stand for Hindu values"" (evidence for this is anectodal, everyone in my (+wife's) family voted Tharoor in 2009, most of our parents' generation voted BJP in 2014). Tharoor still had the youth/liberal vote and won, but by a margin that was an order of magnitude less compared to 2009. A huge slide. In 2019, he faces the prospect of running against Suresh Gopi (popular actor, current BJP RS MP), and stands a real risk of losing. I consider his anti-Brit stance an attempt at pandering to the nationalistic crowd.

It is really simplistic to claim Britain ""looted"" us or caused millions of deaths due to famine without considering how much of India's wealth was concentrated in the hands of Zamindars, Nawabs and Rajas or taking into account the lives lost in wars between the various kingdoms and city states that dotted the Indian sub-continent before the British brought it all together. Well Tharoor is not completely wrong either. India was rich, maybe not as rich as all those WhatsApp forwards mention like 27% of world GDP and other crap. I also believe that Tharoor's fans are a little bit exaggerating his debates and speeches. I think he's going to use this wave of false patriotism that's been around which makes people patriots on social media, to his advantage in the next elections. I mean - no one really discusses if a robbery is ""overall a good thing"" even if it did help turn someone's life around in a positive way.  > The older generation fears it more than the young, whose minds are more decolonised and who are more confident in adopting the West's material beliefs without fearing the loss in its cosmological ones.

As I've been trying to explain to the languagetards on all sides, accepting English IS decolonization. Glad to see an academic agree. I can drink his urine straight from source Brilliant. Learned a lot about myself and my country...  Brilliant article. Its important to see good arguments from both sides. Thanks for sharing.",2017-09-12 01:15:04

Used to be. Still is in India

You work at buzzfeed OP? We have something similar in Sikkim called Dalle. Not quite as piquant but I can promise you the bright red, cute looking cherry isn't going to be sweet. It has a lot more flavour than the Bhut Jalokia and once you get used to the heat no meal is complete without 1. In fact, eating rice just becomes a chore without it. God I love dalle. 

Bonus meal tip: Mix raw wai Wai with some dalle paste on a rainy afternoon. You're gonna love it.  TIL: The hotness of a chilli is measured in Scoville Heat Units which is basically the number of units of sweetened water needed to neutralize the 'hotness' of a chilli.

The Scorpion was dethroned by the Carolina Reaper. there's a hotter girl in town now I have a bottle of its powder, and a pack of the dried whole chillies, and just being close to the bottle (within 4-5 ft) can lead to a runny irritated nose and lips for the heat intolerant.

 Drunken and non consensual. Anyway, what's up folks?  In this thread people are talking about their first kiss and here I am, browsing reddit and having never met a girl apart from my cousins in my life. So, let me just talk about something I know.

#fuck you valve
Fix the bloody Indian dota 2 servers. Its fucking unplayable. 22 year old me, with my best friend(know her since a long time), head to a bar with other friends. Get high. Dunno how we started kissing when others went to loo or what ever. Kissed twice. I regularly visit that place. First kiss at 17 in coaching class with fwb.  Cheeks or lips? Never happened ;_; [deleted] Waiting for one.  End of 11th grade. Made out in an empty classroom for over twenty minutes. Best kiss ever Anyone watching Barca Bayern match tonight? Holy fuck kxip got analed. My first kiss would be when I was 19 - yeah pretty late but pretty much made up for that. I have a date - actually a drinking date - with a Polish girl this week. First time it was supposed to happen ->

Met my GF for the second time at a restaurant. We were warming up to each other when a text came to my cell and she read it. It was from my ""back-up"" long distance GF. Long story short, kissy toh huwa nahi, break up ho gaya. :(

First time it happened ->

Fast forward two years. Same girl. Same city. Different restaurant. We sat at the corner table, hidden from rest of the restaurant. She goes ""Jaldi se kissy karlo. Koi aa jayega"". :P I cupped her face and kissed. :) See Abhijeet defending Salman on Twitter. ek number ka chutiya insaan

see his tweets at @Abhijeetsinger [deleted] /u/blasticity2 how was wbjee?

Got qualified for kiit. Someone wants me :'(

Also today's ipl match. Lulz.

Zzz

I'm awkward with guys more than girls lel. I don't talk to a lot of people though. Plz to Advice : 

Why is it necessary for guys (specially me) to keep on initiating the conversations. When i am just looking at being friends. Why do girls do that? If you arent believing in having friendship with a  guy say me, the fuck do you be a chatterbox once i initiate the conversation.

Experience holders and girls plz to advice . Honestly i am not hitting on them then also they do it like this. Kya hai bhenchod 

I hate it when people throw their fits over me, and then fucking turn off your cellphones and disappear. This just because they assumed something about me? And didn't listen to me?

> ... The unstated part of the BJP-RSS relationship was that the Sangh chief, Sarsanghchalak in RSS parlance, himself would not show his hand. **The behind-the-scenes role for the minder was necessitated both by the 1949 undertaking to Patel and to overcome the strong political opposition to Hindutva. The governments of 1977-1979 and 1998-2004 became possible only because the RSS agreed to keep out of sight**.

> ... **Cut to 1949 and the RSS‚Äôs undertaking to Patel to write a constitution, which, among other things, would specify that the Sangh had ‚Äúno politics‚Äù and would remain ‚Äúdevoted purely to cultural work‚Äù (Article 4(b) of the RSS constitution; D.R. Goyal, 1979). The written constitution was Patel‚Äôs pre-condition for lifting the ban imposed on the RSS in the wake of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs January 30, 1948 assassination**.

> ... On November 14, 1948, the Home Ministry held by Patel issued a press note which said Golwalkar wanted the ban lifted without agreeing to the government‚Äôs demand that the RSS reform itself. Further, the note quoted information received from the provincial governments, which showed ‚Äú**that the activities carried on in various forms and ways by the people associated with the RSS tend to be anti-national and often subversive and violent and that persistent attempts are being made by the RSS to revive an atmosphere in the country which was productive of such disastrous consequences in the past‚Ä¶**‚Äù

> ... The letter of September 11, 1948, was to Golwalkar himself. In this Patel lauded the RSS for its service to Hindu society even as he outlined the ‚Äú**objectionable part**‚Äù which ‚Äú**arose when they, burning with revenge, began attacking Mussalmaans ‚Ä¶‚Äù Further, ‚ÄúAs a final result of the (communal) poison, the country had to suffer the sacrifice of the invaluable life of Gandhiji ‚Ä¶**‚Äù Patel said people‚Äôs opposition to the RSS grew when ‚Äú**the RSS men expressed joy and distributed sweets after Gandhiji‚Äôs death.**‚Äù Well. Power corrupts. And absolute power corrupts absolutely.  (Don‚Äôt remember who said that, but it fits here) Any lawyers around? Is it possible for a court to cast out the leadership of RSS and give control of the organization to an external administration? If an organization is clearly in breach of its charter and principles, and the current governance structure takes no notice.. surely that‚Äôs grounds for dismissing the leadership? So, complain to Sardar Patel? ;)

You can find the source by copy pasting some text from below and googling.

> I am going to write the truth about this unfair evaluation..there are few things u must know...
> 
> 1. GGSIPU pays Rs. 25 per answer book ....in one bundle there are 30 answer books so it makes Rs750/-  for evaluating one bundle....GGSIPU norms say that a evaluator must take 3 hours to evaluate one bundle....so in a day a evaluator can evaluate a maximum of two bundles.....which makes a total earning of Rs.1500/- per day + a conveance of Rs.600/- per day making the total amount = Rs. 2100/-.
> Now what actually happens is in the university there are two evaluation centres one for first and third year and the other for second and final year.....now actually what happens is....an evaluator reaches centre A at 9:30 am and get a bundle issued which he/she checks in one hour but do not deposit it as the university employees will not take it back before three hours...so they leave that bundle there and rush too the B centre and get another bundle issued there at 11:00  they check it by 12:00 now they rush back to centre A to return their previous bundle and get a new bundle issued there....the same process is repeated and an evaluator ends up in checking two bundles each at both evaluation centres thus earning Rs. 4200/- a day instead of Rs. 2100/-  a day..
> now just imagine the answer book u wrote in 3 hours is evaluated in less then 2 minutes.....coz the evaluator has to right the marks on front sheet and do the total and also fill an additional evaluation sheet with marks....and all this he does in a maximum of 1 and a half hour for 30 answer books. This is done by around 20 % evaluators who comes for evaluation.
> 
> 2. To be an evaluator the university ask every evaluator to fill a form which contains a maximum of four subject that the evaluator has taught in the current semester.....this form need to be signed by the hod and the head of the institution also......now the beauty is very few teachers teaches more then two subject in college but in these forms most of the evaluators fill four subjects....now imagine four subject for centre A and four subject for centre B which mean they know 8 subjects and thus makes them elligible to check copies of 8 different subjects...coz if one subject answer books are over then they can get the next subject issued....
> 
> 3. Approx. 80 % of the evaluators do not prepare a solution nor do they know the solution.....they are just giving average marks.....that is the reason why the students writing anything get marks and often pass the exams.
> 
> 4. Most of the senior and sincere teachers do not go for evaluation....the people doing evaluation are primarily those who are on consolidated salary getting anything between Rs.20,000/ to Rs. 30,000/- as salary from there parent college....so they find it as an opportunity to earn some extra money.....just imagine that there are evaluators who earn around Rs. 50,000/ or even more during evaluation......this should explain most of the reasons....
> 
> 5. The fact is very few evaluators actually evaluate the answer books....90% of evaluation is done with just the monitary benefits associated with it....so until the university takes some serious counter measures .....this will continue to happen.....

I have seen my friends getting A/S Grade after applying for revaluation..in the end they pay 750rs per paper(Original exam fese) + 700rs(Revaluation fess) Any inside stories from VTU? Eh? isn't this common knowledge? 

in AP, Telangana both 10th,11th and 12th papers are corrected by lecturers coming from schools and other districts and they are paid according to number of answer scripts they check. like 8rs per paper. so, to make money, they end up rushing. 

even OU and jntu engineering papers are corrected this way. 

also, since they come from other districts, if you give latest relevant examples on your answers, theyll cut marks since that example is different from your text book Subjective exams in India , ah the good old days In my Medical Sciences University, we enacted wide ranging examination reforms. 
We tried to make all our examinations objective (see: OSCE / OSPE ) However, the Medical Council of India had mandated essay and short answer type questions and we could only impose objectivised examinations for the formative stage. 

For summative however, we did this:

One Evaluator will evaluate ONE answer for all the students who appeared in the exam. His bias will be distributed equally to all the students. Also, we do post-examination analysis to see if the answermarks form a bell curve. Camel humps and shifts to right and left will make us blacklist the examiner. 

In post graduate exams, the same answersheet is evaluated independently by three examiners, blinded to other's marks. If the discrepancy between the three is greater than 25%, a fourth examiner is bought in and the average of all the four is taken as marks awarded.

It is possible to study the problem and introduce corrective steps, but most of our universities are archaic and very slow to change anything.  It happened to me in my first semester at College of Engineering Guindy, Chennai.   
The lecturer was miffed with our batch and decided to fail random students.   
She awarded F for first, middle and last 6 of students with even roll numbers.   
  
I fell in one of those even roll number and failed, despite having scored S grade in all my internals, and it was my favourite paper.   
Failing first time academically was hard on me, and I was crying in my lecture hall for the whole day (cringe).   
I had to apply for reevaluation to clear it.   
   
That episode was a turning point in my student life, and went on to score few more arrears in the following semesters, and didn't give a flying fuck.   
  
   
Our rating systems are a joke. Being an Ex - IPU student.... I'm not even surprised.  Happened to me in 12th Board.

Used to always score 90+ in maths, was expecting atlesst 95. Got 40!

I went there on a class trip in 2007 and an artist was repainting the work on the columns. In my broken Hindi I asked if I could help him and he let me. But was unable to get a picture of me painting because of the photography restrictions. afaik clicking pics is prohibited inside that palace.

Moreover, as I'm jobless and the chances of getting an engineering job seems slim I am wondering if it is too late to listen to what has driven me since childhood.

Is there any hope for me, and if so, what kind of certifications and courses are needed to be competent?

[Don't Follow Your Passion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVEuPmVAb8o) I know some amazing photographers and all of them suggest only one thing, to not take up photography as a career without securing am alternative career path first. The thing with photography is you can become a pro by just being a hobbyist as well, a weekend or two outside and whipping out the camera to take pictures isn't a big deal. Maybe build a portfolio and apply to places first. But do this while you at least have a job. Photography is an expensive hobby.

I might come off as rude and cynical but this thought has been bugging me for some time now.",thisisatypo," My colleague, a lookdev artist used to quote:   
""Camera is a mere tool, it's the eyes and brain behind it that matters"".   
    
That dude had a beautiful photo blog, with pictures shot on a 3 megapixel, point and shoot camera.  
    
    
Photography used to be a rich guy's hobby before the digital age. 
We used to shoot carefully to use one single roll for our college assignments.  
Every wasted frame was crime. It depends.

 I personally believe that a lot of beginners just get great equipment and the camera does everything, they're satisfied. They crank up the focal length and blue the background, and suddenly call it great photography.

Crystal clear photographs != good photography. 

A good photography depends highly on the composition of the image, a sort of mood that it evokes. I know that it sounds kinda pretentious, but that's what I believe it is. I used to do casual photography, nothing great, and to date my favourite photograph is one which I clicked on my phone.

That being said, entry DSLRs cost around 25-26k and they're more than enough to get you started with photography. Everyone is a photographer these days. So unless it's a hobby you are committed to, and you know your stuff, don't spend money. You get decent cams everywhere. Also every chutiya these days has a camera around his neck if you walk around. Learn composition and lighting. Then comes the resolution and sharpness.

Most people do not learn composition or lighting. I have a Canon 5D, Mark III, Nikon entry level DSLR, a Canon point and shoot digital camera and an iPhone XR. Guess which one I use for photography nowadays. My phone. I rarely take out the other equipment because my iPhone (or for that matter any smart phone) lets anyone to take great pictures by fine tuning the aperture, exposure and shutter speed and what not. And then you have a myriad apps to do post processing. 

So yeah, once upon a time photography was a rich person‚Äôs hobby but it is anyone hobby today and there are a gazillion places to learn, fine tune the pictures and showcase your photos... so no, photography is anything but a rich person‚Äôs hobby.
P.S. don‚Äôt get me wrong, costly equipment makes a lot of difference but remember, today‚Äôs smart phone can do ten times more than any camera did twenty years ago so the limiting factor is your mind. Not the damn camera. Camera saste me dilwao toh humara bhi angle and perspective mast hai.",2019-06-05 19:34:03

1. Which DSLR Camera to invest in?
2. Photographers who can guide and help me through, I am willing to assist and work under you. (I will be staying in Mumbai in the month of June.)
3. Any workshops/talks/courses I can attend? 


Ping me if you are experienced and could discuss this with me. 

Hi! I am a 20 year old. I am very interested in Photography and I would like to engage more systematically in it. I am a beginner.
I would like to invest in a good DSLR camera as I don't own one yet. Someone who could guide me on that and also take me through things on beginning in this field. I would like to intern under someone as an assistant so I can get exposed to the on field working and learn practically.


I am passionate about capturing anything evoking an emotion. I believe myself to have an eye for detail and an active observer of everyday little things. I like to document them. 
As of now I have just tried my hand in Phone Photography and uploaded pictures on my Instagram. The photos I click are sometimes personal to what I relate to and often open to interpretation.

Thank you for reading! Please help me out.",gotmylifetogether," Don't know where you are from, sorry, but this field is really, really overbooked.

For me, a single photographer has no future in India, my best advice will be : make a team and join an elder. 

Internship will be more than free when actual photography already charges very low fees.

I know because i tried myself in Bangalore and most of the people do shooting for free to build their portfolio so most of customers expects very low budget with best gear.... so it takes years to refund materials.

Doesn't make sense. 

&#x200B;

Second and last advice : be the best at postproduct (LR and PS) Take this question to [jjmpf](http://www.jjmehta.com/forum/index.php) as well. Too many people interested in Photography especially those in college.

So your best bet is to take some good photographs which you clicked and send it to a potential guide.

Also post the pictures on instagram (Have a proper account dedicated to photography), a lot of people I know were recognised for their talent sooner or later this way.",2019-05-08 21:42:36

Best bet is to get from outside India. Get someone to carry it. Few years back some film was available in Chandni Chowk Delhi. No idea about now.  Welcome to an expensive hobby! I buy from Prabhu Digital in Bangalore. But they're expensive. I also came across Tanotis where I've ordered some Kodak gold from. I'm still waiting for the delivery. Check them out, they seem to have lots of good stuff for analog photographers, including darkroom equipment.

Not sure about Delhi, but I've heard of a Eastern photography company that stocks film?

Good luck with your search I bought 35mm rolls from random camera shops in Gautam Nagar, Chandni Shop and some in Gurgaon (Galleria, Vyapar Kendra etc). You might not get a well stocked shop but you will get a couple here and there. Best bet is to ask someone to buy it from abroad and send it to you. You get a better variety of rolls too.

Just keep trying odd camera shops (Kodak/Fujifilm type stores that used to develop the rolls at first) wherever you spot them around in Delhi. Cheers!

It's really upto you really, how or when you choose to use it. If you do decide to do it, it can be one of those hobbies where it may even takes years to refine the language, depending on the commitment your're willing to put into it. If i may add, it'd be easier if you included the people you intend to use it with, to chip in when you're making the language.

I am on my mission to find a good deal on a film camera but my question is how much will shooting, developing, digitalizing the film will cost? How would you compare the cost to that of a DSLR camera? 

Also, what is the normal price of film rolls? Is buying them in bulk a better option if I'm planning on taking a lot of photos and minimizing cost? And if the analog photography market isn't that great in India, will importing them from outside India be viable?

Thank you very much for your time and effort. Have a good night. ",bigplaya6," It's expensive now. They are charging Rs. 200/- or more for developing the film roll alone. Add another Rs. 150/- for the scanning.  Yes, check the JJ mehta forum. There is a small community of photographers who still shoot analog. Analog photography is viable in India but the costs  would be high, it would also depend on where you live. Most shops have gone digital and stopped processing film in many cities, so if you can't find a shop to process the film then there are ways to do it online.

You can get used film cameras in good condition from ebay. There's a store in Bangalore called film foto store, they also have a website through which they sell film rolls, accessories as well as processing. The film rolls are a bit expensive though.

",sidcool1234," Xiaomi Yi dash cam. Looks good, enough features, decently priced. Got it from Amazon for 5.5k or something. Though you can get it for much cheaper on ALIExpress. Bigger question, do dash cameras actually survive Indian heat on the dash? I use one. Got a $40 Chinese made one that had a very good rating on Amazon  from Amazon-US through a friend visiting here. 

Works perfect. Has a 8GB memory card and stores last 4 hours of video I guess. I leave my car in the hot Sun and the camera seems to work just fine. Has a very wide almost 170 degree viewing angle. The battery backup lasts just for 10 seconds allowing the camera to shut itself down properly when disconnected. I leave it plugged into the cigarette lighter socket. Got a splitter for the lighter socket so I have one more slot for charging my mobile when needed. 

Its good to have the dash cam, especially in India. A very small investment but could save you from a mess. Haven't had to use it but I think they are acceptable as evidence if needed.  I use my old Redmi 2 with the Dailyroads app The Rexing V1

https://www.amazon.com/V1-Dashboard-Recorder-G-Sensor-Recording/dp/B00X528FNE

This. I ordered this on Amazon USA a few months ago. 

It's a reliable dash cam.

Also, slightly unrelated but I believe that the trick to seeing whether a product is reliable via the Amazon review section is to see the one star review percentage. For this it hovers around 8% which is kinda okay. The same being in single digits is always preferable.

Is it legal in India to work as a free lancer while employed full time? or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

I have searched online but, I read lot of mixed answers to this question, which got me more confused rather then making my doubt clear. Please help.",Invincible_XI," > or does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

this. read the papers you signed when you joined your current company. It's standard practice among employers to include a clause that forbids you from moonlighting. So in all likelihood, your company should have that too. Ultimately, it depends on how cool they are with you doing a side business (provided they come to know). 

Almost everyone makes secondary income from equities, real estate, etc. and companies don't bother about that. But whatever you do, make sure you do not use any company resources (including office hours).  Do it in somebody else's name. 

Like an elderly relative or not working sibling.

 As long as your freelance stuff is not connected in any way to your full time job it should be fine. But do check your employment contract, company code of conduct and perhaps get written confirmation from your company's legal team. Just don't tell your employer or get caught. Talk to you manager/HR. As long as there isn't any **Conflict of Interest** situation, you should be allowed to do so. But it all depends on how anal your manager/company decides to be. The company I used to work for, before going full-time freelance, were pretty cool and had no restrictions on me doing a freelance side job, which I did over weekends, holidays or whenever I took leave. 
  
Do note that you will have to file your taxes for this extra income separately. So make sure to talk to a CA before doing so. > does it depend on the employment clauses of the company I work in?

Of course this.

In addition to checking that, there is a simpler logic you could apply. 

Don't focus on the end-product if it competes with your company, **focus on the tools**. If the tools are same, then you might land in trouble.

For e.g. Write Code for Day Job. Make Samosa as free lancer. Quite Safe

Write Code for Day Job. Make Graphic Design as free lancer. Somewhat Safe.

Write Code for Day Job. Writes Games as free lancer. Hmm... Maybe Safe, but someone can always claim you copied some algorithms.

Thank you once again for your awesome skill. Got myself an analog synthesizer - learning about synthesis, programming and sequencing. I really like turning the knobs and pushing the faders up and down. I haven't even got into patching modules yet. 

Looking forward to endless fun on these machines.


 I am not much into portraits, bur rather more of figure drawing. Tried my hand with pencil. Here is a couple of them

Also , a lot of thanks for the zentagle appreciations. I missed a couple of posts last time, but if anybody is interested in it please pm me. [deleted] I loved collecting Stamps. I still have so many of them. I wonder if this hobby is dying.  Balcony gardening counts? I want to learn drawing, doodling. Do you guys see those comics online like XKCD, Commit Strip etc? I want to do something like that. So where and how do I begin? [deleted] Made a website (very little content): [Unfilled Space](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/)
Its not ready for mobile yet. You will see no ""modern design"" if you open it on a mobile.

Here's a justification/apology for making such a website:
[Unfilled Space / A New Social](https://unfilledspace.neocities.org/p/a_new_social.html)

You can make your own site for free at [Neocities!](https://neocities.org)

-----------------------

**A note on Websites for the absolute beginner**

Websites are basically just documents.

_The real way_

If you have a piece of text you want to turn into a website, you just have to do add some special formatting so that all computers around the world, made by different corporations and running on different software understand it in the same manner. This formatting is not very different from the way you apply formatting to Reddit comments. It is called HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language). So instead of using ** to make a piece of text **bold**, you'll have to write <b>bold</b>, and so on. Granted, writing HTML is boring business and requires great motivation (only) in the beginning. It soon becomes second nature.

I learnt HTML in this [easy tutorial in 3 parts](http://htmldog.com/guides/html/), only the first part is enough to get a working webpage.

_The easy way_

If you do not want to write HTML you can simply write up a page in MS Word and from the File Menu you will be able to save the page as an HTML file. When this file is uploaded to a fixed location (website address, such as one created using [Neocities](https://neocities.org)), people around the world can read it. (Neocities also has an HTML tutorial but I haven't tried it.)

Edit: Added a note on websites From past few weeks I have picked up a hobby of converting used Coffee jars into home decor items. They can be used as a pot for indoor plants or as a pen stand or a flower vase or a desk based decor.
This is my first foray into the world of crafts and my first comment on reddit (I have been a long time lurker). Apologies beforehand for any errors.
[Imgur link](https://imgur.com/gallery/beSvJ) Any photography enthusiasts? 

I have been interested since I was a kid. One time on a trip, my parents gave me the camera to take pictures. When we returned home and got them developed, I realized it was pretty interesting. Subsequently, I handled the camera on all our trips. Since then, I've been trying to better myself. 

I hope one day I could earn enough to retire and pursue photography professionally.

Anyhow, here's my [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/_tejasj/) and @_tejas.j on instagram WOW!!!! Thank you so much /u/mujerdeindia for the mention. It's an honor!

I am gravitating towards this general plan for 2017 - no [Pencil](http://i.imgur.com/H16fZOj.jpg), [Pen](http://i.imgur.com/4lK4jmp.jpg), [Ink](http://i.imgur.com/guZAsLr.jpg), [Watercolor](http://i.imgur.com/8DzLzSq.jpg) or [Digital](http://i.imgur.com/WWEuskj.jpg), but focus only on new medium - Acrylic. Last week was dedicated to [getting initiated to the medium](http://i.imgur.com/uMCkGKW.jpg). Next week I will focus on sharpening the edges and smoothing the contours. May be, week after that, if I could gather enough courage, I will work on my first desaturated /r/redditgetsdrawn in acrylic to get a grip on values. If everything goes ok, after few more weeks of value portraits, I will move on to colors. I will be more than happy if I could achieve an iota of what [this guy does](https://www.youtube.com/user/LarrivaArt/videos). Can we have a weekly music thread just like this? where we could share music that we found interesting? I'm looking to start painting. I have always considered myself as bad at design and painting.Will probably start watching Bob Ross on youtube. What all colours would I need?  Has anyone done this? After seeing u/neoCasio [comment on flute](https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5khm46/biweekly_hobbies_and_oc_thread_27122016/dboae1w/), I have taken this up last week.

Photography,How much would you charge for food Photography?,5,8zd54z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/8zd54z/how_much_would_you_charge_for_food_photography/,9,"I wish to know the amount food photographer in India charge if they are working with food platforms like Zomato, Swiggy etc. I want to get a general idea for the same. If anyone can help that would be amazing",baggym," Really depends on who your client is. I've worked with food stylists who charge 60k/day, but this is in tv commercial work. A hospitality group can afford a decent budget, but a small business type independent restaurant will be much more price conscious.

If you are new to food photography, my suggestion to you would be to be upfront and tell them you haven't done this professionally, which is why you will work with them on pricing, so its fair for both parties. Also drop your regular rates in this conversation to anchor a price point, so that you don't get low balled.

You make your mark in this specialization and charge big ticket prices and you will still get booked, but until that day you do what you need to reach that level. Play the long game, money will come.

*Edit: Just saw you wrote zomato, swiggy. Quote high and wait for counter offer. If they accept without a counter, your quote was too low.* I got in touch with a third party company in Chennai that wanted photogs to go around and take pics for Swiggy in Chennai,  They pay was 350 bucks per restaurant and  I had to shoot 3 restaurants a day along with 14 or more pics per restaurant.  That amounted to 1050 bucks a day and that doesn't even cover the cost of a days rental for my camera, so I politely told them to fuck off.",2018-07-17 07:28:04

Photography,THE UGLY SIDE OF WILDLIFE PHOTOGRAPHY: Camera-toting tourists and unscrupulous professionals in search of the perfect ‚Äòaction shot' are a danger to wildlife and habitats,134,4e9cv5,http://mintonsunday.livemint.com/news/the-ugly-side-of-wildlife-photography/1.0.1386835189.html,34,,new_lenovo,"  as DSLR costs become less more people buys one and open a Photography Page on facebook and like to fill his TL for that gaze this problem seems to rise even more We were in a bus in Bandipur National Park, despite telling everyone not to use flash, this one idiot who was wearing sunglasses, takes out his phone and starts taking pic after pic with flash. The elephant got mad and charged towards the safari bus. We luckily escaped because the driver drove and then the tourist got the full ire of the official and the people. Fucking idiots.  This reminds me of the birds of Bharatpur.

We go on hikes at Karnala, Parsik hill and nearby green areas of Navi Mumbai regularly, however, we have stopped mentioning bird watching places anymore because soon a herd of photographers ""hijacks"" that place (esp Vashi for Flamingo) and leave trash in mangroves. Disgusting, I know but a ""casual"" DSLR can cost around 50,000 to 2L. It's ""affordable"" for many. Heck, even 18-19 year old kids are given DSLRs in my family. [deleted] Step 1: Shoot with a DSLR, apply a black & white layer & add a waterstamp of ""XYZ Photography""     
Step 2: Post it on FB     
Step 3: Whatever anybody tells you or wherever your career is heading, keep on telling yourself that the guy in 3 Idiots was also after Wildlife Photography !! As an avid amateur photographer this irks me the most, when I encounter people who use flash, I try to handle the them by engaging them and saying that ""You won't get good photo with flash on"" most of the time they listen and turn their flash off.  I remember reading once that some cunt was crushing nests and eggs in them after taking photos so others wouldn't get chance to snap a pic. Motherfucker.

Anyway, shit like this is why ban seems like adequate response. civic sense is fucking uncommon. Here's a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5Unq-1VyQU) of a baby elephant being beaten at Dubare in Karnataka so that people can safely take selfies of themselves in front of the mother.

Photography,I started my Btech degree yesterday at the age of 25.,2211,ciddbn,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/ciddbn/i_started_my_btech_degree_yesterday_at_the_age_of/,466,"For those who are ashamed of going for their bachelor's after the age of 21, I started my btech degree at the age of 25. Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such ""old age"" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.
I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. 
I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)


Thanks,

If you are someone, who is reading this and you are stuck in a similar situation, feel free to message me for any queries/advice/motivation.",fuckyallmat," More power to you bro. Wish you all the best! [deleted] 25 is still an early age. I've known a lot of people who went to college in their 30s and are doing quite well.

Just make sure you use what you learn and build useful things. Congrats on bouncing back! Also, just remember that majority of Indian engineering institutions are filled with professors who have no idea about the industry. Unless you're lucky, you'll mostly only end up with a useless degree at the end of 4 years. Just keep learning new things on the side and build a few pet projects for your resume. Just my two cents. You are an inspiration bro. Just one thing, don't wait for graduation to start earning money. Learn new things and start doing freelance work. When I was in college, the schedule seemed so hectic that I didn't find any time to do anything apart from study and a little sports. But now in job, I realize I had a lot of free time then and could really do better things than just wasting it on bakar. Do competitive programming, contribute in open source, pick relevant projects, maintain a good github profile and take up online courses on new technologies. You have a unique advantage of maturity that most of your batchmates don't. Perspective changes with age and there's more clarity on what to choose based on how much value it's gonna add. Use that advantage. You know there are millions of people who wish they could redo their college days with the same level of maturity and wisdom that they have now and you my friend are living their dream. So keep the motivation up and make the best out of these four years that you have. That's such an inspiring journey .. imo opinion failures are necessary for success .. those who succeed without failure cannot grasp the true value of achievements Better late than never. I was feeling quite anxious today about my career and I am just 21. Just graduated, dropped CA, picked up CFA. 
Now I've been applying for jobs and so far not much has happened. I was feeling defeated but I guess we only lose when we  stop trying. 
More power to you, to me and everyone who needs. 

You'll land on your feet because you are willing to work and that's what matters at the end of the day. Fellow front-end dev here. Hit me up for any sort of help at any time! Please get scientific paper published by the end of your [B.Tech](https://B.Tech). Contribute to open source projects. These are my suggestion. A good career awaits you. You shall be inspiration for others and me. Let me know If i can help you in any way. Good luck!!! I wish there is someway I can reach out to you and hang out.     

I am also from JU - I started my undergrad in a crappy engineering college at Bangalore. I loved Bangalore, loved Kannada people but hated engineering and the college. I grew up in Jodhpur Park - right next to Jadavpur University. I even had ice cream when the chemical engineering department used to make them as an experiment? I think it was the chem engg dept but I could be wrong. You were probably in first year when I was in PG1.   

I did not face any of the adversities that you do - not even half of them. As I read your post, I realized how privileged a life I have had.    

None the less, dropped out of engineering - joined JU Arts. As much as people hate on JU arts - they are the most liberal people I have seen. There was a senior in the faculty who was also an engineering dropout and he would reach out to every dropout who came to JU arts and encourage them. Mind you there were plenty and weird as it may sound all of them are doing so well in their lives now!   
 
Anyways, JU arts turned it around for me. I did decently there, went onto get 2 masters and then finally into a PhD which I am hoping to graduate next year. I am 31 now and ironically I code for statistical analysis now. I had dropped out of CSE engineering and the only difference is I like what I do now.   

The moment I read JU, I hoped JU would be the turning point for you - just as it was for me. But we all have our own stories and our own journeys to take.   
 JU is and will remain my alma mater and anyone who is remotely connected to the institution as a student is nothing but family.     

Don't let people tell you what to do and how to do it. I have had really stupid people both in JU and mostly outside tell me that I would amount to nothing  - because I dropped out and because of my age. Bro, I started my PhD at 27 - two students I met in my cohort 1. An American African woman aged 41 2. A White gentleman aged 55 who had just retired from American Army. These two were older that most of the cohort which was by average 35 years old and what a bloody inspiration they were to the PhD cohort. PhD cohort's have a pretty high dropout rate but the gentleman was one of the few full time students who cleared the qualifiers at one go, especially the econometrics paper. While the lady was not that good at maths, she fought on and eventually cleared both the theory and econometrics paper. They outworked younger candidates like me and brought in all the experience they had gathered to research projects. I ended up being really good friends with both of them. In fact they are the closest friends I have on campus. So no, age is honestly a number and nothing else - fight the good fight!  


If you ever feel like talking to someone or hanging out - please reach out to me! This was actually my last summer break here in the country and I will be in Philadelphia for most of the graduating year but if there is anything I can help you with - please reach out! I am more than happy to hang out as long as am in the country.   

And again - fight the good fight, I am sure you will do great.   
I leave you with a song that I used to listen to when I got depressed in JU about my career trajectory. The song was an anthem for us dropouts - Pulak da wrote the song. Pulak da was from Philosophy department and died in a road accident. I thought you might like this : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVmqXFJtN-A It‚Äôs never too late to do anything. Good luck üëç That's some really inspiring material for someone who has done engineering and pursuing first year masters in psychology at the age of 24. Late bloomer but I'll surely gonna have a great career ahead Wise man learns from others' mistakes. So here's a mistake I made that you could learn from. In my graduation, all I did was try and pass exams. I did well in grades, but in terms of learning or knowledge, I didn't have much. So I had to go back to basics after my degree. Don't do this. Please take keen interest in your classes, curriculum, and additional learning. Don't be just a literate, be an educated person. All the best :) More power to you, bro! Sotti khub bhalo lagche eita porey!
I hope you become really big in life. Thank you for inspiring us to work a little harder. It's awesome you chose this for yourself! Never be ashamed to choose education especially when life takes away opportunities  from you unexpectedly. You had the chance to grow and you took it. That's a win in my book.
My father had taken up bsc in physics and chemistry when he was 16 because my grandfather wanted that for him. He had wanted to do b.tech right after his bsc degree but my grandfather passed away unexpectedly. My father was financially burdened at 18 yrs of age to take care of my grandmother and his 4 unmarried sisters.
He could never pursue b.tech again and its his biggest regret in life. 
Don't listen to society and do your own thing. All the best! >Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments

Most of my photographer friends are facing this issue too. They have tried to get endorsed by brands. But only a few succeeded. Tough career path.

Anyways happy for you. This post motivated me to get up and fucking study while I've time. I'm a bit depressed regarding the backlogs in my masters. Hope to get over it soon. Great for you bro. 

I don't think you'll need it but if you want any advice on frontend web-dev, just PM me, been doing it for two years.. Thanks man, your post was really encouraging, as someone who failed in previous master program and trying to go back to another master program, I really needed this. You are doing a good job going back to your bachelor's studies. 

Everyone should remember, not everyone's situation is the same to graduate by 21 and achieve everything in life. 

Life is not a straight line. I started college in 2013 when I was 18 I got Btech IT by 22 I had lost interest in most things was probably depressed and also took the bold decision to drop out of college instead of giving make up exams because of  very low attendance coz I was busy playing dota and other games,drinking,rolling and watching every fucking TV series  now 2 years later beyond the depression and being looked down upon I feel ok the first year after dropping out was he'll coz I didn't have any friends back in hometown and my parents kept telling at me all day to learn my dad's work and look after it.i used to think how fckin shit I was couldnt do Btech , anyone can do Btech these days wtf, slowly I started going outside doing some of my dad's work made friends.im 24 now and life is better I still think about my fucked up life decisions.i dunno if I'll ever go back to get some degree but thanks for the motivation. Question : What you do for living? Small milate jao, large banate jao Thanks for being an inspiration man. For many wonder only few do. 24 year old here... gonna start my masters in Computer Applications or get into Med School.

&#x200B;

I was the guy who had been completely destroyed by depression. I passed my +2 in 2013 and even after 6 years, I was unable to join any college.

&#x200B;

This year, I have come out with flying colours.. so much so that my family is baffled.

&#x200B;

Never Give Up!

&#x200B;

I hope you achieve the dreams you're striving for. thanks bro , i am struggling with CA at the age of 27.
i was confused tensed dont know wt to do but your post was a welcomed perspective to me thank you 
Godspeed to you bro !! People like you are rare who build themselves. You are destined for something big in a unprecedented future. I can't say where you are going to reach, but your spirit is telling me you're going pretty far. Oh wow this is my favorite post. Thanks for sharing it with us. ""Age is just a number, prison is just a room.""



Jk, Good luck bro. I wish u all the best. bhaii jo sahii lagta haii wo kar; bhaad mein jaye duniya [deleted] If you are doing CS, then I would recommend you go down a different path
-  Look at MIT course fundamentals for CS
-  Look at CS jobs and pick up any lang. or field -
- Get the best at it and end up writing a lot of open source projects
- Get hired at small startup and work your way up

Hands on is more critical and you would have had 4 years exp while learning a lot more working. The only way I would suggest you do engineering is if you are looking to follow that with MS and going down research path. If your end goal is to get job and work in IT, this is more than enough. Best of luck bro. Best of luck! Stick in there. Did you consider opting for an open university course, like IGNOU? Good luck.. Congratulations!!!! I am your same age, I dropped out of BDes in the first year in 2012. I did BCom on correspondence and now I'm going to do my Masters! 

When I did start my BDes course, I had at least 3 other people who had done their BTech and then come for BDes. They were 24-25 at the time and it wasn't the least bit weird. they fit right in, we loved their input and ideas. You'll be that person in your college! 

You'll have more worldly experience, more stories to say and hey you can act 20 years old and thatll be okay! (I still act like that sometimes when I say stupid things and jump around like a kid) 

Good luck on your degree! All the best buddy!

I don't know if I can be of any help to you, but just wanted to let you know that I have been a developer for about 5 years now, so if you need any help in knowing about any learning resources, or getting something done, or just general industry trends in the field, I just might know a few things that maybe of use to you.

I'll always be happy to help! Brave move man. best of luck. Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exams. Quick! Get some experience and money then begin a IT start up. The only thing I can tell you is that just dont depend on degree, get your CERTIFICATES with proper training.

I don't know much about the current requirements and trends in IT field but as far as I know, go for AWS. That's the beauty of Computer Science.Any body can learn and code!There are no boundaries , no silos , no walls.Kudos to you for dusting off and getting back on your feet.Remember,no one is bothered that you have lost time,it's only you against your past. Check out this roadmap\[1\] what you need to learn to get a good internship but this is no way an exhaustive list but from my experience this good enough to get a decent internship focus more on projects and attend hackathons. 

&#x200B;

\[1\] [https://roadmap.sh/frontend](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) Misread it as Betch degree. Wish you all the best, brother Man you gave me goosebumps and hope. I am currently doing my Btech I don't have any backlogs but my GPA isn't good either, I am too afraid I won't get a job. Bhai lore jao.. Jaa hobe dekha jabe... Enjoy Can people without a degree get a job in web development in India?? If so is there growth for him in that job? I have seen a lot of blogs about getting a job (in developed countries) in computer science field without a degree but how much of it is true in India?? Can someone working or hiring answer this please? Hats off man. I'm sure you will succeed at anything you try if you apply yourself. You have the brilliance and even more importantly the determination not to give up. Best wishes. Good Luck!! Best of luck buddy. It's really good to see that you have taken that step, wish you all the best for your future, but at the same time i feel that if you are planning to take web dev as a career option then there are many certifications out there, for which you have to attempt examinations, going to college for 4 years seems like a huge burden to me apart from that college is expensive as fuck.

However i will also say, you know more than me, I am just a teen here with 0 life exp. but thought this could be a better option MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU.... A thought out focused attempt at 25 is far far better then a attempt at 18 which is everything but focused. Apna time apne pace le chalta hain, don't let anyone shame you on that. Good luck Only in India people fucking expect you to start engineering right after school. I think we should all take time and pursue after giving it a thought. I saw this video on Harvard law school where this girl used to do a job and only after proper thinking she decided to pursue law because she loved it. This was uplifting! All the best You are very courageous dude. I wish you success and I hope you didnt completely drop photography. All the best brother. Fuck what they think. Dude cheers! For fighting depression and staring once again. Only strongest can do. Thanks for sharing this and wish you all the best bud! > I really love front end web development at the moment.

I'm a frontend developer. If you need any sort of help, I'll be happy to do it. All the best buddy :) You're amazing. I'm doing my post grad right now. I was already a year older than majority of my classmates in school. And I took a drop last year. The thought of me being a couple of years or maybe even 3 years older than my classmates, was in the back of my mind. &nbsp;

This post is improving my confidence. &nbsp;

I wish you the best OP. All the best OP. This is, of course, is big call in the context of our society. Hope it pays off for you. You know you'll be at an advantage compared to others because of the added maturity in mindset and approach you might take in studying. Wish you the absolute best, bro. Wish u all the best Thank you for this post. I wish you good fortune in the wars to come.

This was like a slap in the face. The mistakes that you mentioned people make, I've made them all and then some. Whereas you've overcome your situation with determination, I had slipped more into  depression due to my failure. Now I feel old and not ready to start anew. I confess that this post will not fill me with new energy but I will wholeheartedly pray for your success. you will be more mature and will waste less time. and am here 22 think too old to get education dont have any degree only high school pass wanna study something but still dont know what should i study.

Myself 22 and having a 2 year gap after ug preparing for competitive exam. Theres no age to education. Well done bro. Also do share pics or your photography profile if you have it online. Keep it up. Same here. Started my degree at 25 this month itself. Cheers to both of us! I sincerely hope nothing but the best for you ! Hope you have a successful and fulfilling career ahead . All the best bro All the best to you! Don't let this determination in you fade ever! :D Great man Good luck man I'm 40 and I never went to college. It made no difference. You just need to recognise that a degree and education are different things. Don't let the fear of not having a degree be your primary motivator. Good luck and happy hacking :) Hey bro, let me start by saying that you're doing an incredible job completing your graduation. With that said, I'm sorry about your father and I hope he's doing okay now.
I was pursuing Btech in Chemical Automation and Diagnostics, dropped in my third year 2013, was 22, started with B.Com this year, would be 29 when I graduate, so I'd say I'm pretty much in the same boat as yours. I'm still trying to figure out what should I do in regards with my career, but in the meanwhile picked up SQL, now preparing for MTA and JLPT N3, both of which I'll attempt next year.


>Failure at 25

FWIW, you're definitely not a failure, for, I know you'll make it big very soon. All the more power to my man! God speed to you. This post should be posted in r/getmotivated as this is what real motivation is. Brother, here's hoping for a great future! That attitude in our society is such bullshit. When I was in the US, I encountered so many >25 year olds and even 30 and aboves who had enrolled into business school or engineering school just because they couldn't do it earlier or because they just wanted an additional skill in their reportoire.

Absolutely nothing wrong with that.

Kudos to you man and best of luck! My wishes with you brother.


Here is all you need to know about web development.
https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap You gonna be fucking happy in 4 years. [deleted] And here I was being depressed because I couldn't get into IIT ..... Great work man.... Keep it up You did right thing bro.
Let me know if you ever need any career advice on software engg. I wish you the very best... You are an inspiration to human being..
üëçüëç Good luck bro you will do awesome in life keep learning You go! 

Remember it needs a lot of guts to go against the conventions set by society, you will definitely do something big in the future!

May God Bless you! feel you bro!. I'm in the same boat. Passed 12th in 2014,failed in physics theory. Couldn't clear my 12th and neet in later years too cuz instead of study I used to smoke weed later on Charas till LCD+had lots of issues with myself too until 2018,appeared for 12th again from State board. Took admission in tier 3 college for botany(H) at the age of 22. I feel like a shit most of the time,lots of advice went unheard from my side cuz I wanted to do me,tried not to keep regrets. Funny I did ended up taking up bsc course that my dad said I should've taken,wasted my time. So I feel I've failed them and my only option for me to make it up to them is to qualify some government exams, hopefully UPSC,IFoS. But it's scary in comparison to medical lookin' for job prospect in botany cuz I don't know what too look,where to look,all I've ever seen a botany graduate that they end up in teaching jobs and plus given my history and age I might not be able to score some decent job,everyone around me has completed their study doing job while I'm still studying,it sucks. Well I don't know what future holds for me but meanwhile i'm focusing on what's infront of me,slowly building. I'm still learning to believe in myself and trust my abilities. Rest I leave upto universe, dont know where it will but I have gotta put effort into it.

Sorry for any mistakes,i'm not really good at grammar portion of english,I can just make sentences that make sense in my headüò¨  Due to financial conditions, I have to do teaching job after my masters and have to be a private teacher for more than a year until I collected enough money for my B.Ed. Many batchmates of mine have commplised many things now but here I am fighting my own battle. All the best! I needed this kind of motivation badly. All the best for the future üëç this post needs an award!Proud of you brother,it takes courage and i can relate to this as i have been going through a similar phase..All the best! Doing this requires courage. I am glad you shared your story. This is inspiring :) 
ALL THE BEST!!!

My brother is in the same boat as you are. Although he is just 22. He qualified JEE in 2017, but decided that engineering was not his cup of coffee and wanted to study law. He tried those exams as well and got into a decent college, but 2 years down the line he started questioning his decision... He had interest in computer science as well and he used to code sometimes even when he was pursuing law. 

Now when he started to realize that law was not for him, we discussed a lot, pros and cons of this decision and he decided he wants to pursue computer science. So he started college yesterday. Best of luck bro. Fuck the society and go for what you feel is the best for you. I can so relate to the fact that it is expected to do all things in a certain pattern and by a certain age. Hope you succeed and do well! This post is proof that you don't need a degree to be educated. This post made my day. 
Wishing the best for you! 
You‚Äôre awesome! ‚ô•Ô∏è Well, there's a Master's candidate at my University who has a daughter doing her bachelor's Best of luck friend Indian society is full of fucking wankers. Forget about them and pursue what you desire. The only opinions that matter are those of the ones you love. Nobody cares what the society thinks. Kudos for taking the plunge. All the best! Kudos to you my man. Such an inspiring story. 

I too studied chemical engineering, though not at 25. It wasn't for me either and I ended up depressed. Took a year off after bachelors and am gonna study physics now. 

I could learn a thing or two from you. Keep up your spirit and fuck the naysayers. You made my day‚äÇ(‚óâ‚Äø‚óâ)„Å§ Bookmarking this. Best of luck in life bro. Congratulations to you for making such a bold move. To do what you are doing certainly requires courage. You are an inspiration to the young generation that gives up their life over some petty issues. And the society we live in is also kinda judgmental. Having said that, you must be receiving support as well.Now that you are embarking on new journey of your life, wish u all the happiness and luck. You go man.. ain't no shame in pursuing what you want to.. good luck.. I would say you could have done a 3 year BSC or BCA instead of BTech from a tier 3 college. You could have saved some money and a graduate degree one year early. Then again more power to you for doing something what you like. Great attitude man, our society adds unecessary stigmas to everything, just do what you are doing and don't give a fuck about what everyone else has to say. I takes courage to beat the cliche in this Indian society and pursue what you love. May the force be with you. I am happy for you!!! :D Good Luck. All the Best That was perfect, godspeed. I hope you are successful in all your endeavours. You never failed. You just got a break so that the universe could mold you into a better person. And stop comparing apples with oranges. It doesn‚Äôt help. I am glad that you never gave up. ‚ô•Ô∏è >  I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. 

That's not a valid comparison. India education system is all handholding and spoonfeeding. Great going dude. Keep it upüëçüèª Just applied for MBA in correspondence, there is no age to learning, Your doing the correct thing, All the best bro!!! First year is the toughest so focus on clearing them, after that you can apply for internship/ job at local web development firms. 
As your college is tier 3, they won't mind your job as their main concern is fees, they'll let you attend job without problem. 
I am asking you do job is because industry experience is highly appreciated by MNCs and also because tier 3 colleges don't provide the required guidance and are far away from realities of what's going on in the industry. All the very best bro ü§ò All the best brother.  God  bless you on your new path. Chutiya lodo pe dhyan na de, God bless. Good luck. I'm 29, and have backlogs still. Wish I could do something and get a degree soon. 

Keep up the good work bro, more power to you! ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ‚úäüèΩ Would strongly urge you to learn python and big data. I know you are passionate about front end but to leap to salaries your peers are earning you need to give a chance to technologies which are and will be in demand. Kudos to you for being brave. Thanks for this inspirational post. You have broken the stereotypical lifestyles that most of us lead  and I hope things work our well for you from now on :-) Thank you for sharing this.  Indians need to change this idea of ""this only happens at a normal age"".  Your never too late to start! Good luck! Better late than never, my friend. Sir u are an inspiration for a lot of students out there. I studies subjects in school and college that I had no interest in but had to study cuz i wouldn't be able to find a job with the subjects of my choice. Breaking past the social stigma is a surely a daunting task but not an impossible one. Good luck. Guys if u think the degree matter to do something in life? only positive story i find in this group. i will refer you to big 4 when you graduate. humanity is dying this is inspiration. Well..for all I know if my Jee plan backfires so does my neet  plan..I could still try again GREAT, more courage to you dude. I myself thinking of doing masters in technology, I am past my 30. Never stop learning. Drop me a message if you want to do internship in frontend development. Most of my friends are CTOs and Lead Frontend at various startups, I can get them to give you a solid experience. Good luck on the journey. You sir, is simply the one we want right now.

You are copying something that is much more valuable from the Western culture Brightens my day FULL POWER SCOTTY GET THOSE KLINGONS Thank you for sharing your story, it will surely help me :) Good luck!! you are never too old to learn Dude in all honesty, really proud of you for listening to your heart and taking the proper decision. 25 is young bro! We believe in you my man! Thanks brother for sharing your experiences. My relatives always try to make me feel like a looser when I dropped one year for a better college and try to compare with their son that I used to be one year ahead now I am in the same year as him. :/ Great job brother! All the best to you All the best dude! Hope you‚Äôre successful with your degree and in life, in general! As someone who's pursuing CA and is in a similar position, thank you for making this post. If only my relatives stopped pestering my parents about my age and my parents in turn didn't label me as a loser for years, I would've been a different person today. I've literally stopped going out to family functions or keep in touch with such relatives and friends (sadly, everyone) who's only opinion on you is to compare and be judgemental. Reading your post has inspired me to do what I'm doing without paying heed to what society says. After all one has lost only when one gives up. My friend who's in Europe currently for masters said it's common to have students who are 30+ in masters, even bachelor's and nobody blinks an eye.. so unlike our Indian society. I wish you all the best and I hope we make the best out of our respective situations. Thank you so much for this. I recently changed my major in college to economics so I'll have to stay an extra year to be able to complete my credits and honestly I get made fun of a lot for that because I'll be the only one not graduating on time. It made me so happy to see this. Good luck to you too! 25 is a young age! When I was doing my undergrad, over the course of my 4 years, I‚Äôve come across people in their 50s and 60s attending classes and trying to get a degree!
And yeah, they were really good at their work. Read Btech as Bitch, that's all I am 24, and I have enrolled myself into a BA (Economics) course. I dropped out of [B.Tech](https://B.Tech) Mechanical three years back. Reading this gave me hope. Thank you. Wish you all the best with your career! May you get an awesome job after finishing your course. Good for you, age is just a number. Never too late to keep learning.  Forget what society says. If you don't take charge of your life, other people will. Good luck mate. I'm graduating at age 23. Brother! This post of yours right here, this shined a light through my bleak day!

You ARE A CHAMPION!ONE OF THE BRAVEST!Wisest as well!

That must have been a hell of a plunge to take, and you fucking took it!!
I hope you find what you want to do and what you excel in brother!!! Age is a number bro. People around the world go back to college when they feel like it and when they can financially foot the bill.

You will make a better and more mature engineer You are really an inspiration for many people. Even my mother completed her under graduate degree when my elder sister was in 10th standards. She was struggling every now and then to educate us and now we all are earning, she wants to leave her job and pursue more education! After reading your post, it's proved once again that to get knowledge-age does not matter! I don't have any rewards, but here is your gold! ü•á I don‚Äôt have an award so here you go. All the best, sir.

P.S. - Saved this post to track your progress, do give us updates! r/india itself has a big comp sci grad population to ask to if you need help I'm proud of you, macha. Please don't delete this post, cause I've saved it and I want to look back at it from time to time for inspiration. You are on your own timeline, no one matters.
I messed up my first try at B.tech(Completely my fault. I fucked up big time.) I turned my life around when I was 21, joined a 3rd tier college, completed b.tech Cse this year, got placed in Mindtree. TCS, Wipro did not let me sit on campus drive for my gap years. I had three other offer letters except Mindtree, now looking forward to excel myself more.

All the best to you. It's  good to hear that you're from West Bengal, are you Bengali too? Bring future awaits my friend Good luck Bhalo laglo eta pore! Egiye jao bro Man you just motivated me to prepare for NEET again just as I made up my mind to give up. Our life should not be scheduled according to our age as societal norms force us to do. May you succeed in all your endeavors. ‚úå‚òÆ And I'm a retard who took a drop from 12th last year... I laugh at it now XDD but I think whatever happened... happened for a reason now I'm completing 12th this year and boy the maturity i feel now towards study is unmatchable by a regular 16-17yr old 12th student. Man, I love seeing posts like this on this sub. You are part of the new India which looks beyond judging people for things like going back to school. Good luck! I hope you enjoy what you do and never regret any of it. Just finished my first year of undergrad. Turned 24 during it. Yes, fucking cunties and cuntkles talk, but fuck them man we got this. 

All the power to you dude, good to know there's more of us around :D Just want to say, I started school at 23 after a not so good 18-23. 25 now graduate next fall. Just keep with it. Make friends, have fun. Its ok to have fun but don't be stupid. Indian here in America, I am about to graduate with my bachelors at the age of 25. I definitely understand the pressure of not being graduated especially in the Indian circles. That‚Äôs mostly why I choose not entertain the people who judge me. Those that mind don‚Äôt matter, those that matter don‚Äôt mind üòä Ganbarimasu, senpai! I'm finishing it at 28 üôåüëè Your moto is your username üòÇ, have a great college life bro Best of luck to you man.Depression is one hell of a thing to get through.Stay strong buddy ‚úåÔ∏è You've got photography basics clear, use that to be a developer who writes code with design sense. Example, coding for apps about photo filters...(even courses like image processing from electrical department would help)  Or more generically, even front end designing could be your thing. You don't necessarily need to take it as fresh start. Use your past. More avenues will be visible once you connect these things.

Being a master's dropout, i think I'm able to learn more without college (also saving on money if that's a factor). Yes, job hunt will get difficult... which is why make a coherent story (you got curious about designing while being a photographer and decided to work on that skill.)

Still, given that you have a different pace/way, no need to get more societal validation in form of degree. Save that course money and spend it on your own thing. Because you're picking CSE, this particular skill can be easily learnt from internet. 

I'm almost saying- why give more chance to education system that failed to empathize first time? (However much you think it was your fault, it wasn't). The system is still the same. Use your time to do plenty other things in the world. God speed to you....to infinity and beyond! Doing my post graduation at the ripe age of 35, I can totally relate. Feel like a fish out of water. Other than what your studies , get into the open source world. Start understanding programming concepts, try building some stuffs on your own, post them to GitHub. Rinse and repeat. 

For any help related to programming or web development in general you can reach out to the below communities.

/r/learnprogramming I have finished both my gold and silver. Else this would have been my proud gilding. All the best brother. I am a CSE graduate from a tier 3 private college in kolkata and trust me when I say this: the placement scenario here is not at all good, largely due to the quality of faculty and poorly structured WBUT/MAKAUT curriculum, which in turn translates to poor quality students, hence do not rely on college placements. If you're interested in coding and comp sci in general, explore outside the curriculum (be active on hackerrank, spoj, explore ML, Blockchain, contribute to open source projects and so on). Doing so would help you make it to the bar of the top product companies which pay much better and have a lot better work than the mass recruiting companies that hire from these colleges. [deleted] You are actually in quite an envious position. You are much more mature than the other graduates, you know the world out there so I don't think you would be negligent in your studies. I would say go give it your all and all the best! 

P.S - I would suggest you get started on your studies now, it would be really easy to score an awesome job right after graduation of you start now. Pick up competitive programming or anything... Try freelancing, try out everything. That's a great achievement . Wish you more bright days in life .

I am currently studying in a foreign country and once per year I get a chance to see my family. Last time when I went back home I had two laptops with me. One of them was my personal laptop and the other one of my university(which I have to return back at the end of my degree). Some people had told me that they are not going to charge you tax if they are used laptops. But when I arrived at the airport they asked me to pay tax on the laptops. They asked me to pay 50 dollar import tax on the 2nd laptop. I told them that they were not new laptops but used ones. While I was talking to one of the officers another guy came from behind and started shouting at me. ""WHAT IS THIS ? OPEN YOUR SUITCASE. WHAT IS THAT ? WE KNOW YOU HAVE TWO MOBILES ALSO..."" . I realized later that they were only trying to pressure me into bribing them. Of course, I did not bribe them but I ended up paying 50 dollars on something I did not even own. Keep in mind that I am a student and 50 dollars is a lot of money for me. I come from a middle class family and my scholarship pays for my university.

This year I am traveling again. Of course, this time I will not take two laptops with me but I have to take some candies and presents for my family. I wanted to take a lot of presents for my mother but because of this type of behavior I am scared of taking anything. Is there any way to deal with these people without losing your hard earned money ? The presents I am going to take will be around 2000 rupees(which is the limit). Could be a bit more than 2000 rupees. How should I respond if they behave like that again ?",vitaminsboy," I travel in and out of the country a lot but I never had such experience. Heck I have even got a PlayStation for my brother once without charges. The two laptop thing is an actual rule though you can't have two. Don't know about the phone thing I just put my second phone in the check-in baggage. And when you say ""they"" do you mean the customs officials? Thats because they believe every NRI has a tree in their backyard that grows money and we are plucking money from it when we fly back home.  There is no point arguing with govt officials.  Which airport ? Ask them very politely for a photograph and then a video. Tell them if it's legal they needn't be afraid.

Key is to remain calm and polite. If you lose your temper, they try to frame you or harass you. 

Btw.....Which airport? take the next flight out of India",2016-04-21 05:01:21

>* On January 13, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) reinstated its October 2016 order banning all kinds of photography by flight crew on board an aircraft.

>* The move came five months after HT reported a first-of-its-kind complaint against six Indigo pilots who were caught taking selfies on board.

>* Taking photography during flight is a source of distraction, which may lead to error and resultant reduction in safety, reads the order republished on the DGCA website on Monday.

>* In a recent case one of the pilot was engaged in photography during training flight, which eventually resulted into an accident, added the note issued by joint director general Lalit Gupta.

Photography,[R] Advice for a career in photography.,9,613c6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/613c6z/r_advice_for_a_career_in_photography/,3,"I am asking for my brother who just finished his 12th and wants to pursue photography as a career. He does not want to become an engineer. Can you help me with the following:

A good coaching institution which he can go to over the weekend. M-F he will be pursuing some commerce course, cuz some degree in the backup.
I have found [Udaan](http://www.udaan.org.in/weekend_course.html), andheri, mumbai which does that.

What types of jobs do professional photographers get into? Is it true that the field is on a decline with smartphones?

Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

I am not in Mumbai but want to help him pursue what he likes and help me set on a good path.
",FaizalCricket," I am self taught and photograph semi-professionally (still mostly a hobby, but getting paid pretty well now). 

> What types of jobs do professional photographers get into?

Weddings. If he enjoys it, there is a lot of money to be made in India. Prices for an experienced photographer range from 2-8 lakh per wedding (4 events) in Delhi and Mumbai. These aren't even for the top photographers. For someone with my experience, there is more money in Delhi, than London!

There is also even photography (corporate), and then there are regular portraits, headshots, model portfolios etc. These are like the bread and butter in the off season. Maternity and baby photography is taking off in India. Not as highly paid yet, but still around 15-20K for around a 3 hour shoot. This has a lot of potential.

There are other options like real estate and architectural photography. Lower end is not worth it, but if start getting corporate gigs, that's very well paid.

There are so many others, like product and food photography. Each is different and requires a different skill set/way of thinking. I think I am pretty bad with food. 

> Suggestion for a camera which he can kick start his career with. Budget = 30k

How long has he been photographing for? Cheapest DSLR, probably a Nikon D3XXX (whichever number is current), and a 35mm prime lens (can buy used for around 5K). You can even look at a second hand camera, as long as it is in a good condition. In my opinion, you don't get enough for your money by upgrading amongst the low end cameras, so you'd rather get the cheapest and use the spare money for other gear - this helps more than, say, buying a D5XXX. Depending on what he wants to photograph, he will need a flash (look for Yongnuo - and quite okay). 

Good luck!

Photography,Delhi-Based Serial Sexual Harassing Photographer Outed by Victims,23,3ss228,http://scroll.in/article/768482/delhi-photo-festival-director-sacked-after-a-flood-of-sexual-harassment-allegations-emerge-online,7,,sleep_of_no_dreaming," The photographer in question is well known in Indian circles as the founder of Emaho Magazine, and is on the board choosing nominees for an award in the field of photography. Given the testimonials he's fairly likely to use the opportunity for more sexual harassment. This unfortunately happens all too frequently in Indian workplaces as evidenced by the Tarun Tejpal affair.
After reading the testimonials do please share the link on facebook and cross post to other subs to spread the word. The victims have a right to have their accusations heard. Link to the original blog:

https://iwasharassedbymanikkatyalblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/10/i-worked-as-a-graphic-designer-for-emaho-in-2012/ More than 20 women have claimed on a blog that photo editor Manik Katyal harassed them verbally and physically.

---

> * Several young women photographers, in India and abroad, have created a stir in the international photography industry after speaking out against multiple incidents of alleged sexual harassment by a photo editor, who has now been sacked from his position as a co-director of a photo festival in Delhi.While the women have not yet registered police complaints, they have been using social media for the past few days to recount personal experiences of alleged harassment by Manik Katyal, the editor-in-chief of photography magazine Emaho, headquartered in Delhi.

> * Most of the online complainants have worked as junior photographers or interns at the publication, and some of their allegations of sexual harassment date back to 2012 and 2013.While most of the women claim to have experienced verbal harassment online or in person, some have also made allegations of physical abuse and coercion.On November 7, a group of photographers also created a blog titled ""I was harassed by Manik Katyal"", on which at least 20 women have posted personal testimonials in the form of write-ups, comments and screen shots of Facebook chats in which Katyal allegedly behaved in a lewd manner.In response to the flood of allegations on social media, Katyal has now been asked to step down from his role as one of the three directors of Just Another Photo Festival, a photography festival that took place in Delhi in September.

> * But the main trigger that pushed many women to speak out publicly was when Emaho set up a sexual harassment committee, said another male photographer who started the complaints blog along with a few colleagues.Emaho made the announcement on November 4 on its website, stating that it had pioneered the effort of being the first Indian online magazine to constitute an independent committee which is known as Prevention of Sexual harassment and discrimination Committee.Katyal started getting praise from some people in the international photography community for starting this committee, which made many women indignant, said the blog co-founder, who believes social media is a natural platform for young adults to vent their anger and rally around each other across international boundaries.

> * Meanwhile, women who claim to have faced harassment are now exploring the options of filing formal complaints either with the police or the National Commission for Women.The social media and blog campaign against Katyal has, however, already begun to garner responses from sections of the international photography industry.Even as Katyal was asked to step down from Just Another Photo Festival, a Dutch photography publishing house called Schilt Publishing announced that it had heard of some serious and disgusting allegations against a certain photo editor and that it would not ever tolerate the abuse and harassment of women photographers, or photographers of any gender, for that matter.The controversy has also sparked off serious discussions about sexual harassment in the industry and the lack of avenues for those who wish to report it.These are things that one usually gets to hear in whispers at first, said Sohrab Hura, one of only two Indians to be made a member of Magnum Photos, an acclaimed collective of international photographers.

Photography,"Moar photography! Here's the Andromeda Galaxy from Dandeli, Karnataka :)",26,5owa9b,https://i.redd.it/vxa1721wwnay.jpg,9,,chaotic-indian," The bright,rather elongated dot to the left of the frame is the famous Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31. It's a spiral galaxy but the spirals are hard to see due to the galaxy's positioning. It's also one of the brightest deep sky objects you can see, due to its surface brightness and proximity to our Milky Way. 

This was taken in Dandeli, Karnataka almost a year ago,and is one of my all-time favourite photos even if it looks bad. If you're in an extremely dark spot, you can see this galaxy with..*drumroll* **the naked eye!** 

If you live long enough(a few billion years!), you can witness M31 and our own Milky Way collide together :) 

I used a simple Canon EOS 1100D and a focal length of 55mm to get this shot. 

 This is amazing! Keep up the good work. 

And *moarrr*  Nice shot, man Even though Andromeda galaxy and the Milky Way will collide, the distance between the individual objects are so huge that not a single thing would actually collide!

India has potential to grow at a much faster rate but all round mismanagement by Modi govt has resulted in this slowdown.,657,cy66pf,https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1168025028916465665?s=19,119,,Gavthi_Batman," Let's not forget, 5 is the biggest *answer* they could come up with. A colleague was saying ""educated people should never run country they cannot take brave steps like Modi does"".. People seriously don't care about economy all they care about is Pakistan and Kashmir. BJP is doing right ... We are fucked boys More on current situation:

>Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh: It is particularly distressing that the manufacturing sector's growth is tottering at 0.6%. This makes it very clear that our economy has not yet recovered from the man-made blunders of demonetisation and a hastily implemented GST. India cannot afford to continue down this path. Therefore, I urge the govt to put aside vendetta politics and reach out to all sane voices and thinking minds to steer our economy out of this man-made crisis.


In such distressed time for economy, even [few words](https://twitter.com/INCIndia/status/1168018140971905024?s=19), even a criticism (though he rarely criticize anybody) by him is like rain in drought...

Wish he had majority in parliament like the incumbent PM, wish he could implement his knowledge and experience to grow India into superpower... My father runs a business in the automotive industry and says that this is the worst slowdown he's seen is 25 years. He says even 2008 was better and that was during a global recession. Factories halting or running 2/7 days, bodyshops shutting down or halting orders etc(throughout India). These are really troubling times. I hope that change is forced quickly or we'll stunt ourselves for a really long time. I don't know how competent the people in charge of the decisions regarding finances are. 

You just pick anyone random and make him/her the finance Minister. I know they don't make the decisions themselves, have a team of supposedly experts behind them, but I won't be surprised if the so called experts may also just be bootlickers rather than competent individuals.

And it should not be tough to find competent people in our country. Check out the comments in any article reporting the same.. bhakths out in full force abusing him..to solve a problem you have to admit that you have one. Cow economics and ram mandir finally taking effect. Acche din bros. He's not wrong. This guy is hands down *the* greatest Prime Minister the country has ever had. No politics, no drama, no braggadocio, no bullshit. He wasn't tainted by crises like Indira Gandhi or Nehru, either. He was all work and no talk. He singlehandedly pulled India out of the mouth of a potential economic depression in 1991 and helped set it on the right track as Prime Minister. 2004 to 2009 saw stratospheric economic growth and even 2009-2014, despite the global financial turbulence, was pretty impressive. No amount of praise will be enough for his contributions to India's growth story. 

But, today's hateful, terrorist-electing India doesn't deserve him. India deserves Yogi Adityanath, Sakshi Maharaj, Pragya Singh Thakur, Amit Shah and that failed theater actor-cum-riot-monger.

Policy/Economy,"Hello Top Minds of R/india, Is the Indian economy being nokia-ed?",49,cz0ctb,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cz0ctb/hello_top_minds_of_rindia_is_the_indian_economy/,42,"I am uncomfortable with the narrative that the bureaucrats and figureheads in the Indian government are clueless morons tanking our economy. Why can't it be the same thing Microsoft did to Nokia? Force a fire sale of Indian government assets. Maybe we are up for the biggest wealth transfer to the richest elite in this country since demonetization? Or am i wearing my tin foil hat a little too tight?

Edit: Spelling",H1ken," One of the biggest reasons for this slowdown is the death of private consumption. It was the only wheel that was sustaining the economy. Now with rural consumption taking a hit, the government is clueless. To revive demand it needs to pump that RBI surplus as development expenditure, but it risks increasing the inflation. With lower income rates and if inflation rises the government is on for a disaster.
Long story short, the government is walking on fire. Why not both? Their cluelessness contributed to the current slowdown, but they are also corrupt enough to use this opportunity to transfer Air India etc to Adani et al for cheap.

Also privatization does not have to be the government's brain child. It could simply be the government's friends seeing an opportunity and them 'convincing' the government. > Force a fire sale of Indian government assets.

This is a good rationale actually. Keep the tinfoil hat, we'll see more patterns like this. I am more interested in knowing what microsoft did to Nokia? It will happen. There are a lot of PSUs that the govt wants to rid of, but who will buy it when the buyers themselves are in a slump? 1) Global recession was long forecasted for 2020 
2) We failed to capitalise opportunity to get business from China 
3) Indian economy rested on what we call ""black money"" , addition of cluster mess which we call gst further compounded it, lack of government trust, and dynamic policies and if that was not enough the accumulation of money from middle class to elite few who won't invest leads to the perfect concoction to kick down our economy. Don't forget recession is part of economy cycle. 

Probable future :We should expect deflation of economy which will lead to lower product costs but also more job losses. 

Possible but unlikely: Govt may decrease interest rate in favor of inflation, now do remember most people use interest as investment option and they may get fked , but I don't see it increasing borrowings. New minted currencies + deflation + lower currency exchange value against usd may lead us down to Zimbabwe root Inviting the top minds of r/India? 246000 replies coming up Damn right!

We were once the 3310 of world economy...sigh! It's hard to predict as this recession seems to be a cyclic one, it's not just India but globally the investment is slowing. There are many factors that can be attributed to current downturn and for every industry there's a different reason. What I believe is that India in actuality never recovered well from 2008, while in fiscal terms we were out of recession very quickly this was in parts fuelled by the excessive lending during 2009-12 from various public/private sector banks.

Till 2013 coupled with High Crude oil prices economy loomed, around 2014 crude oil prices decreased but the effects of NPA's started kicking in economy. During the same time many big loans started converted to NPA's and the every single month the NPA's ballooned. 

In between the Central Government's implementation of GST and Demonetisation fractured a lot of domestic consumption, as a lot of it depended on Black money ( This is my personal opinion ).  The current government failed to control the NPA's till Q1 FY‚Äô19 when there was reduction of stocks of NPA's  by \~Rs.21,000 Cr. 

The government now has started to refinance these banks and merge them, although merging shouldn't have been a priority, while it wasn't a bad step per say. The surplus that Government skimmed from RBI a part of it might be used for PSB Recapitalisation which seems to be a good step, again it's hard to predict anything when it comes to economy its a dynamic system of scale that no one can comprehend.

Rich will always get richer, there's no problem in that. I believe the important issue is for the countries large population ( India )  is to deliver jobs and grow middle class. With a lot of manufacturing automation / automation it would be hard to grow a middle class ( again this is an assumption ) . At this stage it's very difficult to predict to what extent automation is going to affect the job market. 

Now coming to selling assets , may be or may be not. There's no singular answer. 

I think governments montenisation plans on non-core assets is fine, if some business / riches can get even more rich through clever understanding of Indian bureaucracy it's still not a bad deal , not atleast for an average tax paying Indian middle class citizen,  we won't have to shell out money for operations of various CPSEs that are a burden on our pockets. The biggest concern is how this government has a socialistic attitude for the poor and a capitalistic outtake for ultra-rich. There is a very little concern for middle class, anyhow this is nothing new. 

We need to stop relying on Central / State governments, as for our business rather than expecting government to provide incentive for domestic business ( like China does ) , a lot of our business have to grow Global ambitions rather than fixating ourselves on Indian domestic market. I don't think the toxic mix of bureaucrats who are selected through UPSC with questionable hiring process and Politicians will be mature enough to understand the dynamic global market. While it's an extremely painstaking process but I do see a lot of business growing in core engineering services in India ( from mobile transceivers, SDR to Custom ASIC's ) who are actually making a lot of money. Leaving aside fancy AI / ML ( essentially decorated statisticians ).   
There are huge opportunities in global markets, only if we have vision and risk taking aptitude. Our economy is not just and shouldn't solely depend on a immature Government structure.

My grandparents are farmers in Andhra Pradesh.
He harvest 25 acres of land. In the past decade itself, I have not seen a single rice crop being harvested properly. There are at a stage where even in rural areas they need to buy rice.

When there is a good crop, the prices are down. 
They sell at 25kgs for ‚Çπ600-800. While in Delhi I buy at ‚Çπ2500/-. I can't understand this gross miscalculation. Farmer isn't getting it and we as a consumer paying more than thrice of it.

Coming to Auto sector, ""Maruti"" doesn't produce world class products in India. Taking an example of Swift model. There are many differences in Indian version and overseas version. So, if the sales slump in domestic market they can't even push it to overseas. It's a high time for these companies to produce high quality products. 

This government doesn't even know basic economics. How will they? They don't have even one person who has a sound market knowledge.
Giving loans to people like Neerav Modi and making him flee. While giving a free hand to income tax officers.

Irony.

This bit boils my blood. The tax you have to pay is due immediately, but your input claims are never accepted on time, especially if it is a large amount. Idk if this idea is dumb but i think our cultural economy has so much potential and it's obviously being under utilised.

Policy/Economy,I read the Indian economic survey of 2018-9 so you didn't have to. Here are the highlights,96,c95ykl,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c95ykl/i_read_the_indian_economic_survey_of_20189_so_you/,46,"The biggest take-away was the direct attack on what the survey calls 'Anglo-Saxon economics'. Basically the concept of a general equilibrium theory. Instead it claims an economy is always within either a 'virtous cycle' or a 'vicious cycle'. 

A virtous cycle is characterised by rising investment, rising exports and rising savings. A vicious cycle is the inverse of that. 

The implication is that the government must intervene to steady the ship and any fantasy about 'rational actors' has to be abandoned.

The importance of higher savings cannot be underestimated accoring to the survey. It is only with high and rising savings that a country can **self-finance** high investments. Otherwise it must seek out foreign savings which gets translated into a high current account deficit which in turn makes it vulnerable during times of crises. 


They survey continually made mention of China and other fast-growing East Asian economies when making its case in countless graphs. It is clear what the chief inspiration is. 

Having very high savings naturally means having a correspondingly low domestic consumption. Thus, the only way to have fast growth when domestic consumption is subdued is through fast export growth. They survey made the case that because India still has a low share of world export market so there is plenty of scope to regain, regardless of trade tensions.

The survey made many other recommendations, of which judicial reform is one which caught my one, but the overriding theme of the survey was the call to abandon 'Anglo-Saxon economics', by which it meant general equilibrium theory. 

It'll be interesting to see if India truly makes a decisive economic policy break from the past as the language suggests.",MelodicBerries," Based on your summary, (and good of you to make the effort!) the economic survey is goobleydook. 

If they‚Äôre busy saying general equilibrium theory is Anglo Saxon economics (and somehow behavioral stuff is not?) then it‚Äôs some weird waste of time in the ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt even wrong‚Äù kind of bad.

I‚Äôm going to go read it. Now one else has to waste their time on this shit. Literally /r/badeconomics. Thank you for your service to the nation. One of the worst economic survey's ever in the recent years. It was expected, given how the current CEA got his job,

>In articles published in The Times of India and Livemint titled, ""Will Black Be Back? Why demonetisation will be revolutionary in India‚Äôs fight against corruption"", and ""Demonetisation: Are the poor really suffering?"", respectively, Subramanian supported the Government of India's banknote demonetisation policy in 2016. What didn't catch your eye

1. Nudge economics and excessive stress on behavioural economics -> it seems like a kind of foreshadowing and a prelude to ""excuses for data theft""

2. After speaking few pages on gibberish on big data and data, the govt reiterates the same lines as it did before aadhar judgment. Sovereignty of data, state security and providing cheap data to corporates while again, using the garb of security and ease of biz

3. All the wanking on beti bachao beti padhao being an immense success and swacchh bharat being a great success. Sorry to let you know, the chapters seemed kind of promotion than anything related to policy prescription. That's quite a downgrade, even under NDAs standards, given I haven't missed an ES since 2014

4. For all the bashing of anglo saxon economics. Do yourself a favor. Pick up es 2018, book 1. See chapter 1 or chapter 2 (basically the big chapter). In one of the boxes, where it compares to USA and then later in another of the chapters, where it compares savings and investment slowdowns across economies, it shamelessly uses Rodriks theory and proves, India shouldn't give a Damn about savings rate. This time it did a 180. üòÇ Bro thank you for the effort You missed out The Nudge. The mass control program. They are gonna make robots out of people. For the first time ever, a government has openly admitted to using behavioral control. Just imagine the consequences of it as used in electoral politics. Thank you! Can you please ELI5 general equilibrium theory? I am little concern about mutual alienation between india and russia and in return US's backstabbing. 

Theoretically US-China's trade war should benefit india, but by the way US has treated us in the previous term i am not sure. High quality stuff.. thanks! [deleted] So is this a major policy break then? Is India ditching free market economics for some sort of a social democracy (e.g., like the Nordic Model) or are we adapting the managed-economy model of China? Could someone explain exactly what Nudges the govt is implementing?

Policy/Economy,RBI's deputy governor Viral Acharya quits six months before his term ends,98,c4hsqq,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/rbis-deputy-governor-viral-acharya-quits-six-months-before-his-term-ends/articleshow/69920503.cms,38,,killswitch13," >Acharya has been uncomfortable ever since the exit of Urjit Patel as Governor of RBI. His academic views of the financial system was in contrast with the rest of the system. 

Bichde sabhi baari baari... BC hope there's no announcement coming that he wants to disown. This was bound to happen. Oh this is bad. Very very bad.

Deputy governor is a very important member of the Monetary Policy Committee ( one that decides policy stance and repo rates, basically major macroeconomic decisions ). This 5 member panel has government nominees too and decisions are taken by majority vote. 

Since the decisions are taken by a majority vote, it is always advisable to have majority economists so that RBI policies are not driven by political agendas but only sound economics.

And he was one of the few economists in the panel that constitute the MPC, especially after they replaced an economist with a Bureaucrat as the governor RBI.

So why would he quit? Essentially because there's no point for him to be there as virtual liquidation of RBI as an institution has lead to loss of value of individual opinion. In an organisation dominated by bureaucrats, decisions are now not taken in Mumbai ( RBI HQ ) but in Delhi. 

Terrible news. The off balance sheet borrowing pegs the fiscal deficit at 8-9% of the GDP.

Let's stop this silly comparison to China. The beat us badly in the last 1-2 decades, and we are not going to catch up with them now. I am not sure how many commenting have actually read the article,  headline is misleading and does not tell what is the comparison,  bloomberg talks of defense budget mainly, in what sense can india compete with china's defense budget, china is a much bigger economy and have more spending power and is not comparable to india Because economic growth is exponential. The increase in the size of the economy depends on the current size of the economy. China's economy is already 5 times ours. Military spending and geo-political influence which the article is talking about depend on the current size of the economy. It is mathematically impossible for India to 'catch up' with China unless China's economic growth slips to around 2%. Has more to do with China performing exceptionally well than India underperforming.

India is the fastest growing major economy right now but will never reach the crazy per year growth China has had.

Policy/Economy,"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera?",13,cezrj9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cezrj9/what_do_you_think_that_a_united_india_would_have/,6,"What do you think that a united India would have looked like in terms of development, the economy, foreign policy, et cetera? As in, what kinds of domestic policy and foreign policy do you think that a united India (one that keeps Pakistan and Bangladesh) would have had and also how would its economy, economic development, industrialization, and business climate compare to that of India in real life?",Souhondron," An undivided India would've been a disaster which would have made Indians pine for the rule of the British. The compromises that the Congress and the Muslim league would have had to make to avoid partition would've led to an extremely weak centre and immensely strong regional provinces, this would've quickly led to the creation of communal blocs in India with the Muslim provinces of Kashmir, sind, eastern Bengal, Punjab (barely Muslim majority though),NWFP facing off against the Hindu provinces elsewhere.

There would have been competitive communalism to an extent that you can't even imagine. The Muslim league during British times often petitioned them to declare Sind and NWFP as new provinces because they desired numerical parity with the Hindu dominated provinces of present day India like Bombay, Madras, UP etc. This was because they wanted to engage in a balance of power type of situation where if a UP state passes a law banning say, cow slaughter then NWFP will pass a law banning public celebration of Diwali. This communalist tit for tat would've only strengthened communal forces and led quickly to a civil war situation only in this case the violence wouldn't have been confined to the border provinces of Punjab and Bengal but would've engulfed the whole territory of the sub continent. There would be riots in Sindh and in retaliation there would be riots in Kerala. 

In foreign policy terms India would have a restive Muslim population in Pakistan which would look for third party support from fellow Muslim nations of Iran and Afghanistan. This would be especially potent because there are vast historical and cultural links between the border territories with Pashtuns in the case of Pakistan and Balochis in the case of Iran, crudely the Indus river actually is the real dividing line between Indian people and iranic people. The Indian state would have similarly onerous defence requirements as it does now with the Pakistani border except it would also have to deal with a local population whose loyalty would always be suspect. Pakistan has tried to pre empt Pashtun nationalism by raising up the Taliban to supplant it with Islamic radicalisation, an option not available to a Non Islamic Indian state. 

India would also be much more vulnerable to the mess in Central Asia and the middle East, both of the cold war (like Iran and Afghanistan) as well as the recent rise of Isis type Islamic extremism. This has nearly destroyed the Pakistani state but the borders between the two countries has shielded India from the worst of it. The Punjabi Muslim (according to Ambedkar) was always the most susceptible to ideas of Muslim brotherhood with the ability of radicals to weaponise this (like with the Mujahideen). If these people were in the Indian state then it is more than plausible that they would still be as radicalized as they are now, except now as citizens of India they would have free reign to carry out attacks throughout the country instead of being largely confined to Pakistan. 

In terms of economy, Ambedkar in his thoughts on partition showcased that the provinces of present day Pakistan were mostly a drag on the British exchequer while the Indian provinces were a tax surplus. This isn't necessarily true for all times but if you factor in the communal hatred that would develop between Hindu provinces and Muslim provinces then I struggle to see a situation where the economic gains would be great. Harmony is usually better for the economy than conflict.

The situation of minorities of all types would've been worse. Indian non muslims don't really care about the situation of their co religionists in Pakistan or Bangladesh. This is pretty much true for Pakistani and Bangladeshi Muslims as well with one huge exception being the Babri masjid demolition which kicked off riots in Bangladesh and Pakistan aimed at Hindus there, destroying temples and killing people etc. This wouldn't be the case in an undivided India, Hindu minorities in Muslim provinces would be hostages ensuring the safety and well being of Muslim minorities in Hindu provinces. This was an idea mooted solely by the Muslim league but I'm pretty sure that once there had been a tit for tat riot then the Hindu communalists wouldn't be far behind in adopting this theory. Needless to say, not a good way to run a country.

People often say that India is secular only because it is 80% Hindu and I agree with that statement not because of any great rationality in the Hindu faith, but because the question of religious hegemony in India is settled. The proportion of muslim in undivided India would've been large enough for the Hindus to start feeling threatened and for the Muslims to start demanding their pound of flesh (and maybe a bit more). The insecurity is highest at such a point where there's a chance of hegemonic change, it could've been a domestic variant of Thucydides Trap leading to civil war and eventual fragmentation of the country. Far better for one religious group to be in the outright, unchallengeable majority and to feel secure enough by this to give rights to the minority religions.

Policy/Economy,Answering all the questions regarding RBI fiasco,97,a8qw39,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/a8qw39/answering_all_the_questions_regarding_rbi_fiasco/,57,"**Who appointed Urjit Patel?**

Narendra Modi.

**Why did Raghu Ram Rajan step down?**

Because Narendra Modi and his government would not act against NPA companies. And also because draconian Demonetization was being planned.


**Why did Deputy RBI Governor Viral Acharya raise the issue of Section 7 of RBI Act and warn the Government?**

Because Government wanted to step in and take over the Reserves of 10,00,000+ Crores lying with RBI and use them to plug NPA's.


**Why does the Government want all this money?**

Because banks have been rendered empty and the 4,00,000 Crore windfall gain from Demonetization never happened.


**Why companies are declaring NPA's?**

Because their business have failed due to a failing and failing economy.


**But is the economy not doing very well under Narendra Modi?**

If that was the case, there was no need to take over RBI Reserves. The story about the economy doing well is a fake story like everything else told to you by Narendra Modi.


**What triggered this take over bid of RBI Reserves?**

Because many companies were declaring NPA's and the biggest shock came when IL&FS declared (officially) an NPA of 90,000 Crores. And none of the directors was arrested.


**But why take over RBI Reserves when it had already paid a dividend of 58,000 Crores for the last fiscal?**

Because that was not enough to fill the holes created by businessmen who lost money hand over fist.


**What will be the consequences for ordinary people when government prints more money?**

Prices will rise across the board as more money will be chasing the same basket of goods and services.



**Why Does Government of India require so much money and needs to print more?**

It is because GST has failed. From the expected collection of 1,30,000 Crores per month, it is only collecting 90,000 to 1,00,000 Crores with 30,000 Crores going back as refunds. Every month there has been a deficit of 30,000 Crores on an average.



**Why GST Collection has fallen?**

Because it has been declared by IMF as the most complex form of taxation in the world and Indian businessmen have been smart to find out ways to avoid it, also the business volume has fallen as economy has failed.



**Why Business Volume has fallen?**

If you withdraw 83% of blood of an economy for 2 months and then take 6 months to pump back that blood, you can't expect the person to get up and start running as if nothing had happened. Demonetization was such a blunder. It killed the economy and India lost 2% of GDP, which is approximately 3,00,000 Crores. And the losses continue. But Amitabh Bachchan and Akshay Kumar have both certified Demonetization as a brilliant move and they have also been endorsed by the likes of Aishwarya Rai and Paresh Rawal.



**What is the immediate danger?**

Telecom sector, that has seen mergers is now three players, Airtel, Vodafone Idea Limited and Jio and all three are bleeding. Telecom sector is sitting on 8,00,000 Crore possible NPA as estimated by SBI internal report which was later suppressed.


**What about the GDP figures that show NDA-2 doing better than UPA-2?**

Former CEA has already spoken on this and informed how the Niti Aayog changed the figures and how to make NDA-2 look better they made UPA-2 look bad. They just drew a bigger line next to the UPA-2 Line.



**Who is responsible for all this mess?**
Of course Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru is responsible for all this mess and his family. They have not allowed Narendra Modi to do anything in the last 56 months. Had Sardar Patel been the First PM, none of this might have happened.

**Who should resign?**

That's a stupid question!!! Of Course Sonia Gandhi should resign and Rahul Gandhi should resign as Congress President and Modi should be given a free hand with the 10,00,000 Crore RBI Reserves to do what he wants to do.


**Who should you vote for in 2019?**

Of course Narendra Modi, because he is the 11th Incarnation of Lord Vishnu. He is the savior of Hindus. He is the only person on the face of earth who can teach Muslims a lesson. He is the only person in India who can protect the cow. He is the only person in India who takes 'care' of the poor, marginal, soldiers and veterans. He is the only person in India who can build the Ram Mandir. He is the only person on earth who has left behind his wife and family and even his mother and the only person who himself lives on 10 acres of prime property, protected by 5 layers of security while his 90+ year old mother stands in bank queues to withdraw 4000 Rupees as per demonetization rules along with a camera crew. Because he is the only PM who has traveled the world and done so many town-hall and rock-star type shows. Because he does Mann-Ki-Baat every month on Radio and it is broadcast on TV too. He is the only person who can buy 36 jets instead of 126 jets by paying the same price and convince you without giving you any data that 36 > 126 and he has in fact saved money for the nation and yet managed to give 30,000 Crores to friend Anil Ambani.

Because there is no other person in the whole country who is more qualified than him with his MA in 'Entire Political Science' and a missing BA.

Now how dare you think of voting for anyone else?""

As far as i remember, he wasnt given an extension. So if he wanted to continue he would have to follow the same procedure of appointment of an RBI governor along with other contenders i.e. being interviewed by a panel headed by the Cabinet Secretary. Just this fact is enough for a person of high repute to resign.

The reasons you mentioned are relevant as well. But RR didnt step down, he was never given an extension.  [Citation needed] Your username emplies obvious bias here.  If the economy was failing then Moody's wouldn't have upgraded Indias credit rating from Baa3 to Baa2.

He was intelligent and charismatic enough to capture the attention of people or youth especially who otherwise have zero interest in Indian bureaucracy or administration.


Govt should have desperately tried to hold onto him ,on the contrary they worked out of bounds to get rid of him. [removed] No big deal, we have intellectuals like Sambit Patra and Venkaiah Naidu.  Oh, this must hit the Hindutva brigand brigade hard.

I sincerely hope he wins it. And if he does, these guys will claim he is anti-national, not recognizing the fact that it is ironical.

 Knew this was Modi's plan all along.

/s He is the best at his job, as he says :

I'm Raghuram Rajan, and I do what I do. I hope he turns things around as he did with India Only person who must be feeling sad about this is Manmohan Singh, who personally requested, hand picked or whatever you call it, Mr.Rajan to be RBI's Governor. It's sad to know he may never return, but glad he is being recognized so well in a 1st world country. Good luck for the race, you logical Indian. Great news , now Indian economy will again see a depression . LOL This bugger needs to read that Bengal famine essay that gets posted on schedule on reddit. Brain drain üòÇ Rajan did not want the extension. Ask someone who you might know from RBI / senior banking circle.

Policy/Economy,Dr Manmohan Singh is the Real GDP King; Jaitley‚Äôs Blog cannot Change it,43,99b2zl,https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/opinion/dr-manmohan-singh-is-the-real-gdp-king-fm-jaitleys-blog-cannot-change-it,15,,thewebdev," > The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing¬†

Cool. > The Modi government has once again got a panic attack. The Twitter hashtag #DrSinghGDPKing caused it. The underlying reason behind the alarming palpitations is a research panel of the Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation releasing a back-series adjusted GDP based on 2011-12 prices to make GDP comparisons dispassionate shorn of political googlies. This would enable holistic policy-making besides providing fodder for rigorous academic reasoning. **The Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs acute nervousness was on account of two manifestations of the sub-committee‚Äôs findings:**

> - 1) As expected, UPA-1 ( 2004-09) had a record-breaking five-year average GDP growth of 8.87%, an unprecedented score in India‚Äôs history.

> - 2) Even the much-maligned, badgered UPA-2 had a more impressive lead over the headline-grabbing hyperbolic NDA, 7.39% as against 7.2%.

> **Finance Minister Arun Jaitley wrote a hurried, poorly researched rhetorical blog**, Niti Aayog chief put out a few dubious tweets as a diversionary tactic ...

> ... Jaitley & co made an embarrassingly phlegmatic attempt to puncture UPA-1‚Äôs triumphant performance. **According to them, Dr Manmohan Singh inherited a booming 8.1% GDP growth from the Vajpayee government** in 2003-04 and just rode a providential bonanza thereafter ... **What he artfully dodges is that in the preceding year of 2001-02, the GDP had touched a nadir of 3.7% , even lower than the 3.9% of 2000-01** ... **Truth be said, NDA-1 just about averaged 5.6%**, and was easily outclassed by the formidable Dr Singh-P Chidambaram-Montek Singh Ahluwalia triumvirate.

> ... Jaitley then caustically refers to fiscal profligacy of average 5% of GDP under UPA, while selectively ignoring that under NDA-1 fiscal deficit was higher at 5.5% . That is called cherry-picking. **Under NDA-1 the average crude oil price was around $30 per barrel, while under UPA that skyrocketed to over $145 at one stage**; Jaitley has a memory loss of this stupendous escalation when discussing the inflationary impact. Yet, one of the most extraordinary accomplishments in human history happened during UPA; **poverty declined by over two-and-a-half times than under NDA and 140 million people were lifted out of poverty, the second largest ever after China.** Naturally, Jaitley did not mention this crucial statistic in India‚Äôs celebrated growth story under Dr Singh. A pity, really.

> ... **agriculture under UPA grew at an annualised 3.6%, while it was 2.2% under NDA-1.** Private consumption went up 40% faster under the UPA as did private disposable income at 20% as compared to NDA‚Äôs 8.3%. At core, **both the rural farmers and urban dwellers were better off under Dr Singh.** ...

> Jaitley is being mendacious with facts when he talks of alleged scams ... The tradition has continued in NDA-2 with Nirav Modi, Mehul Bhai Choksi and some other close buddies of the current dispensation ...

> ... **UPA-2 (7.39) has outperformed NDA-2 (7.2%) as well by a convincing margin** despite overwhelming headwinds; I list four of them.

> **First, UPA-2 faced the aftermath of the Great Recession of 2007/8** which literally incinerated economies worldwide. It‚Äôs ramifications were both geographically spread (the Eurozone crisis) as well as structurally penetrative. It was the world‚Äôs most testing survival period after the Great Depression of the 1930s.

> **Secondly, oil prices reached a dizzying average of over $110 a barrel**, creating a massive pressure on current account deficit and fiscal deficit, and adding to an inflationary spiral. 

> **Third, UPA had a coalition government** and thus required circumspect calibration in policy-making which was done with adroit political maturity through consensus building. 

> **Fourth, it was actually parliamentary paralysis** (which Jaitley famously described as legitimate political strategy) forced by a belligerent BJP that created a gridlock and prevented the GST and several legislation from becoming a reality during UPA‚Äôs tenure.

> **Yet, UPA-2 has done better than NDA-2, who have had the tailwind of oil prices at $28 at one stage, low inflation, a majority government, growing world economy and above all, a strong inheritance of a robust recovering economy from the UPA-2 of 6.4%. Incidentally, UPA crossed double-digit growth rates twice during its 10-year period.** GONNA VOTE FOR CONGRESS. he is also King of Inflation.

As an active trader, I really hate Congress.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India Retains Position As Fastest Growing Economy, GDP Growth Accelerates To 7.7% In Q4** 

 ______ 
India retained its position as the world's fastest growing major economy in
the January-March quarter, well ahead of China. India's

GDP or gross domestic product

growth accelerated to 7.7 per cent in the March quarter - the fastest pace of
growth in seven quarters. Strong growth in agriculture (4.5 per cent),
manufacturing (9.1 per cent) and construction sectors (11.5 per cent)
contributed to the overall growth. Growth for Asia's third-largest economy,
reported by the Ministry of Statistics, trumped forecasts in a Reuters poll
for annual growth of 7.3 per cent. GDP had grown at a revised 7 per cent in
October-December quarter.

For the full year (2017-18), GDP expanded at 6.7 per cent, lower than the 7.1
per cent recorded in the previous year.

Tushar Arora, senior economist at HDFC Bank, said: ""Today's GDP number is very
comforting and should put a lot of concerns to rest. It seems like we have
moved beyond the teething troubles related to GST implementation. The pick-up
in investment activity (fixed capital formation) is also a good sign.""  
  
The faster pace of growth in the latest quarter might also strengthen
expectations for a rate hike by the RBI later this year. ""We expect RBI to
revise its policy stance in June and follow it up with a hike of 25 bps in
August policy,"" said Garima Kapoor, economist and vice president at Elara
Capital.  

Many economists expect India's economy to grow more than 7 per cent in
2018-19, helped by a normal monsoon and a pickup in private investment.

Though global rating agency

Moody's earlier this week

cut its GDP growth forecast for India due to higher oil prices and tighter
financial conditions, it still expects the country's GDP to expand by 7.3 per
cent this fiscal year.

GDP growth in 2018-19 could get a boost from prospects of good monsoon,
potentially brightening the outlook for agricultural output.

Economists also point out to many risk factors that could put downward
pressure on GDP growth. Possibly, the biggest risk could be rising crude oil
prices, which this month hit $80 a barrel, their highest since 2014. India
meets 80 per cent of its oil needs from imports.

Domestic

prices of petrol and diesel

are near all-time highs, putting pressure on the government to bring down
taxes on the fuels.

Rising oil prices could also weigh on the consumer demand, say economists. The
government's Economic Survey, issued in January, estimated that every $10 per
barrel rise in global oil prices cuts growth by 0.2-0.3 percentage points.

Higher crude oil prices have already hurt the rupee, which slumped to near a
record low this month. It is down about 6 per cent so far this year against
the US dollar.

__ Comments

Banking credit, a main source for corporate borrowing, has remained weak
following a surge in bad loans, as banks have been reluctant to extend new
loans. The 21 state lenders hold two-thirds of banking assets, and accounted
for the bulk of the record $150 billion of soured loans in the banking sector
in 2017.

Separately, infrastructure sector recorded a 4.7 per cent growth in April, as
against 2.6 per cent a year ago, data released by government showed.

Policy/Economy,PM Modi Asks What He Did To Deserve Insults. This Man‚Äôs Fantastic 22-Point Reply Is Going Viral,332,7jh0ie,https://www.scoopwhoop.com/pm-modi-question-answered-22-point-fb-post/#.hcpft6n9z,116,,simplysimplipal," Here you go - 


Here is a brief list to answer your question Mister Prime Minister:

1. For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

2. For destroying the traditional plural culture of our ancient land via organised polarisation - not just religious, but also regional, linguistic and cultural.

3. For destroying the profound teachings of Hinduism/ Sanatan Dharma by placing Savarkar's fascist Hindutva as Hinduism.

4. For continuing the charade of fake nationalism when your deeds and policies are only harming India.

5. For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

6. For false promises and falsehoods which are being spread through multiple channels everyday.

7. For violating the principles of the Indian Constitution by introducing theocratic militant nationalism and anti-privacy/ anti-freedom Aadhaar.

8. For destroying the pillars of Democracy by de-fanging media and institutions - which are critical to offer any semblance of truth and justice.

9. For not listening to people and the diversity of voices - but to impose dictates via coercion and intimidation.

10. For being anti-intellectual and actively promoting the hatred of the learned and the educated.

11. For doing all the tricks in the book to curb dissent and freedom of expression.

12. For sinking all the human development indexes since 2014.

13. For waging a fake 'morality play 'of anti-corruption crusade when the real policies of the government point to the opposite direction.

14. For hiding from unscripted questions which the people want to ask you - no single press conference since you came to power.

15. For focussing on PR, publicity, events and propaganda, but not the real issues of the nation.

16. For ruining India's traditional 'non-aligned' foreign policy.

17. For instigating the ego - hate and greed - through your theatrical 'carrot and stick' speeches.

18. For surrounding yourself with sycophants who have no talent for governance.

19. For being obsessive about grandiose ideas/ misplaced priorities and failing to deliver.

20. For misunderstanding the meaning of 'development' by neglecting social justice.

21. For being pro-super-rich and putting the poor and the Middle class under the technocratic Neoliberal Economic policies which have hollowed out the West.

22. For raging a war against India via the toxic brew of Hindutva and Neoliberalism, and destroying the people's faith and trust upon the government.

And you ask, what I have done to deserve this? Hahahahaha. Like always, Mudiji ne toh rhetoric question pucha tha. Launda serious ho gaya.  I still remember the height of his popularity in 2014, the man has come crashing down hard. With so much popularity and full numbers in the house, he would have easily assured another term if he had only surrounded himself who wasn't an ass-licker !! RIP Devdan Chaudhari. Either dead or arrested. üò∞ Reading his 22 points made me realize that there are only more to add, nothing to reduce. Very well said. I hope modi reads it. Randia linking to Scoopwhoop which links to FB... this is a postception! 21 Reasons Why > Global Zionist banking cartel

Hindu-Yahoodi saazish. ..23 The fact that people worry about getting Vyapamed simply for liking or sharing this post Vyapamed in 3.....2.... I was a Modi supporter, even voted for him in 2014 just because other options weren't half as good as him. Obviously, who didn't think of him as a Messiah who'd save this country from Congress. 
Today, I couldn't have been more wrong, he's just all-talk no-work guy who promises amazing things, failed to deliver any of it. 
However, in my family, almost 95% of them are still pro-Modi, and they buy into each argument he makes. Each time, I try to reason with them, a staple dialogue of ""Congress ruled for 60 years, that shit can't be washed in 5 years"" is thrown around. Only the ones in Reddit, specifically r/India even talk about reason, whereas the entire community still believes in him.  chaiwala samajh nahi paayega I am from Banaras and lot of (read everyone) people in my social circle were a fan of Modi. People were hoping that he would do same to Banaras what Atal Ji did to Lucknow. They were very excited. Then I had to move to another country but when I returned back for vacations a lot of my friend were furious. They were unhappy that Modi allowed Yogi to be CM of UP. They voted for development and didn't expect such a dick move from him. We young generation from UP is really fed up with caste and religion politics. We want development and jobs. But what we got? Again same old shit. I was at least relieved that my friends are not fanboys. Some old people have also started criticizing Modi. They are also tired of religion shit and want jobs for their sons in the state.  inb4 he gets lynched, gets called out for being anti-nationalist, and is told to go to pakistan if he doesn't like it here. Modi is a chutiya of the highest order. Even if BJP wins in 2019 hope he gets kicked out along with that moron Amit Shah. > For being a government - not of India - but of Hindutva forces, crony corporations and foreign vested interests - **especially the Zionist global banking cartel**

Who is the fascist? if some muslim guy wrote this, he ll be picked up by pulis in middle of night. Agree with most but some of the points about Zionist Banking etc are just ridiculous and portrays the intellect of the writer in poor light.  He gon git arrested Ahh antisemetism looked over cause it‚Äôs anti Modi too? He can be arrested for Facebook post  Now that it's pretty evident  whose winning in Gujarat such articles would come out in full force
BTW when did Scoopwhoop become relevant ? lol, author is a conspiracy nut. Modi is supporting zionist banking cartel it seems, LOL The work that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has done. I do not think so far anybody else has done the work like him. >For destroying India's economy via Demonetisation and not taking responsibility for the damage it has done.

First one. Is this true? Last numbers I heard is that Indias growth is over 6% and [is expected to continue](http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2015/01/14/india-china-gdp-growth-world-bank.jpg). Also, Chinas lead is decreasing. 

If this is economy ""destroyed"" what word is he using when growth is negative? 

Im not being facetious. Im genuinely wondering if economy is now destroyed. What are his indicators that this is the case. Seriously NAM ? Are living in sixties ? We Signed a defense cooperation treaty in 1960s which saved our ass against American nuclear missiles.

And had Israeli technology helping our army during Kargil.

The Nam countries didnt give a fuck when China attacked us in 1962.

Modi is just following what Congress was doing in 10 years who themselves were continuing the good work of Previous governments.

Criticizing the govt for it is just clueless. modi is much better than congrees if not the best.atleast he is doing something for the nation and taking risks unlike congress.
tell me a better option than bjp so that i can use my vote in a good way in 2019.
 >especially the Zionist global banking cartel.

Oh... we forgot to congratulate the PM on his *second* ever interview in 3 years!! Round of applause people. He was finally able to make it out of his mansion to give another interview with no difficult questions! It must have been quite the task to get all the questions correct.  Did he just admit that Demonetisation was a failure? Should we then judge him on:

- Imposing an Adhaar which was meant only for public distribution service on everyone in an orwellian way.

- Having the worst record for job creation. 

- Residing over the worst private investment record since 1950's.

Edit: - A Rafale deal which was steeped in crony capitalism.

- Increasing income inequality.

- Enriching babaji's who masquerade as spiritual gurus. Providing them army to build bridges for private events and suppressing activists who protest against environmental destruction for other babaji's from the south.

- Taking advice on demonotisation from a babaji who on behalf of a quack think tank reccomended demonitisation to Mudi.

- Completley bending foreign policy to the west and not adhering to decades of non aligned status. 

- Almost selling off and destroying India's generics industry in the first 6 months of power which would have made basic drugs cost an arm and a leg to attract 'fdi' only to see a backlash.

- Completely disintegrating out military industrial complex that was on the verge of next gen technology only to buy equipment from foreign companies with zero transfer of technology so foreigners and crony capitalists can profit

- Paying zero attention to the agriculture sector which has been completely destroyed.

- Paying no attention no attention to SME sector which is dying without credit while behaving like an NRI prime minister and begging foreign firms to make in India

- Throwing Rajan out to help his crony capitalist friends; i.e so they don't have to pay back their loans

- Spending billions on novelty projects like trains while making no investments in healthcare.

- reducing healthcare spending to try turn India's healthcare into US healthcare shitty and expensive

- MP's like Mahesh Giri who were formerly with babaji's who support Modi using violence against JNU and beating women reporters and calling them anti national.

- Generally using violence as a state policy and killing judges, reporters and activists.

- Trying to destroy the judiciary and making the last institution of India the SC which is honest into a dalali organisation

- making absolutely zero economic reforms to help the common man.

- furthering Hindutva/cow politics  not Hinduism/Sanatan Dharam and sponsoring state violence against dalits.

- Opening up INdia's economy like the real estate sector and retail to foreign speculators while asking for nothing in return i.e visas or job permit increases. Which then bail out builders and destroy the economy.

- Lying about building electricity access and infrastructure at a faster pace.

- Looting money from the public through various cess's like Swach Bharat etc.

- Trying to destroy the environment in order to build infrastructure including vast tracts of forest. Ok... let's talk cow vigilantism? Or moral policing? Or hate speeches? Or rising intolerance? Or the failure of clean Ganga? Or swachh Bharat? Or let's talk about Adityanath becoming a dictator? Or the lack of a policy on Pakistan? Or China making inroads in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Nepal?  Evaluate me on inciter, instigator, provocateur, rabble-rouser, demagoguery skills, rather. We all can judge him on throwing skills (feku). Mitron!!! Evaluate me on the unemployment crisis, the lack of private investment in the county, rising malnutrition, making AYUSH equal to allopathy (MCI Bill), supporting Aadhar after I opposed it, having biryani with China after I ridiculed my predecessor for it, the rising inflation, destroying institutions like the RTI, CEC and CVC, not appointing Lokpal after almost 4 years and renaming schemes.  Kyun behen ke loude... GST and demonitisation is what affected every common man across the country.  This clown really thinks that people have short memory spans and all.

Abki baar, u-turn waali sarkaar. Judge him for Aadhaar, Bullet Train, and Cow Vigilantes as well lol. Ummm, what about the things like cleaning Ganga, etc. that never ended up happening? There is no ‚Äúallowed to keep terms‚Äù for your next 5.   There is no worse 'journalist' on TV than that prick taking the interview. Even Rajat Sharma and Arnab are better. I wonder if bhakts trying to spin this in a positive way are wondering if they are about to have  aneurism. What a retard. A couple of months ago, he was touting DeMo and GST as successes and now he just admitted to them being failures. He needs to see the latest C voter survey to rid him of the insecurities he feels. Judge me by the number of cows I have saved and the jumlas I have made. Hope someone could do epic rap battles between this guy and trump. ""Logon ke ghar main beti ki shadi hai, or paisa nahi"" ...

**Don‚Äôt evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, says PM Modi** 

 ______ 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday urged the nation to not judge him only
on the basis of his decisions to implement demonetisation and GST. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt
evaluate me only on demonetisation and GST, we brought economic reform, built
toilets, brought electricity to 18000 villages,‚Äù PM Modi said in an exclusive
interview with Zee News.

Talking about his global approach, the Prime Minister who recently hosted his
Israeli counterpart in New Delhi and Gujarat said, ‚ÄúThey said my understanding
was limited to Gujarat. I made it my strength. I did not follow protocol, I
was a simple man with no baggage. I made friends the world over.‚Äù

On the upcoming World Economic Forum, Modi said that the world wants to hear
‚Äúdirectly from the Horse‚Äôs mouth.‚Äù The PM also talked about India‚Äôs policies
and growth potential and expressed that he felt proud to represent India in
Davos.

Stating that the Indian economy is growing at a rapid pace, PM Modi said the
Davos meet is a ‚Äúgood opportunity‚Äù for the country as it is a big market with
the strength of demographic dividend. ‚ÄúThe country is seeing the biggest jump
in Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). It is natural that the world wants to talk
directly to India and the world wants to hear directly from the horse‚Äôs mouth
about India‚Äôs policies and potential. It matters if you hear it from the
leader,‚Äù he added.

Meanwhile, Modi also stressed on his push for conducting simultaneous polls
for Lok Sabha and state assemblies and said that like festivals it should be
held on fixed schedule.

**Modi may be the last hope for the Indian economy to achieve greatness** 

 ______ 
Recent weeks have witnessed an enormous amount of hand-wringing in the press
about India‚Äôs economy. These articles share a common thematic trajectory: they
start with a recitation of statistics that highlight a slowdown, lay it on the
doorsteps of demonetisation and GST, and in the grand tradition of the blood-
sport which is Indian politics, either use these statistics to settle personal
scores, or, as in the case of the political opposition, use it to prepare
oneself for 2019 with nervous glee. None of this hand-wringing is accompanied
with any insight or solutions beyond the obvious.

The fox knows many things. The hedgehog knows one important thing.

In a now famous essay written when he was an Oxford Don in the 1930‚Äôs, Isaiah
Berlin classified people into foxes and hedgehogs as a means of making a
distinction about people and the different ways in which they confront
reality. Foxes, according to Berlin, may know many things, but a coherent
worldview is beyond their comprehension. The hedgehog, however, knows one
great truth, and steadfast in its pursuit, remains unreconciled until he/she
reaches it.

This parable is perhaps the best way to understand Narendra Modi and his
actions surrounding the economy. Modi is the hedgehog who knows what India
needs to do to become prosperous, but importantly, is also willing to act upon
it. Indeed, he may be the only politician in contemporary Indian history who
has undertaken structural reforms out of choice rather than, like Narasimha
Rao in the 1990‚Äôs, being compelled to do so.

Structural reform is thankless: costs are borne upfront, and rewards come
later. (The currency for this transaction is political capital, and Arun
Jaitley has paid the most for his role as the able knight who is the face of
such change.) For years, it was the very absence of these structural reforms
that armchair foxes have bemoaned. Now that the reforms are occurring, the
foxes are coming out of the forest, and unwilling to pay the price, claim that
these are ill-timed, ill-conceived or ill-executed.

Through his decade-long executive leadership of one of India‚Äôs richest states,
Modi knows what the foxes don‚Äôt: First, that there‚Äôs never a right time to
make a hard choice, and second, the slowdown is the result of a fundamental
fragility of the Indian economy baked into India‚Äôs economic foundation at its
creation: the government‚Äôs overwhelming role in the economy.

Modi is seeking to eliminate this fragility by recalibrating the entire engine
of India‚Äôs economic growth methodically: Jaitley‚Äôs increasing of the states‚Äô
share in the divisible pool of union taxes in 2015,
digitisation/demonetisation of the economy in 2016, the GST in 2017, Piyush
Goyal‚Äôs work in the power sector over the last three years, Nitin Gadkari‚Äôs
ongoing work in transportation, all are transformative and quantifiable
contributors to the structure of the economy, and designed to create a robust
and higher equilibrium for the Indian economy from which it can propel itself
higher.

That these reforms are happening without any taint on any senior politician of
the government is in itself a first in India‚Äôs modern history. The republic
was lucky to survive through years of pillage under the Congress, and if it
were nothing else but just that the BJP is taint-free, we would still have
much to be thankful for.

But Modi‚Äôs toughest test is yet to come. Just as Modi fought the culture wars
and reshaped our national discourse on identity and nationhood for all time,
and just as how he is transforming India‚Äôs foreign policy through a new Modi-
doctrine, he must now dismantle the greatest vestige of Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs and
Indira Gandhi‚Äôs legacy: the socialist superstructure that is the curse of
India. Only when he is finished, will he have succeeded in his undeclared
personal ambition: to bury Nehru and Indira Gandhi forever.

To do so involves treating the economic organisation of a society not merely
in transactional terms, but as a moral issue inextricably linked to individual
rights and dignity, and moving wholeheartedly towards the only economic system
that provides for such: a free-market system adapted to help those on India‚Äôs
economic margins.

In doing so, he would do well to reduce his reliance on ever wiser economic
councils and bureaucrats, but follow his hedgehog instincts which have yielded
such sharp results in foreign policy and India‚Äôs culture wars. (As an aside, I
note with some amusement a lesson from my first class in economics with
Professor Jagdish Bhagwati: ‚ÄúIndia did so badly in the 50‚Äôs and 60‚Äôs not
because it had too few economists, but because it had too many!‚Äù)

This then, is the call to arms. In addition to a dogged focus on anti-
corruption (a necessary issue for 2014 but insufficiently ambitious for 2019),
Modi needs to speak to the country in civilisational terms about the manner of
its economic organisation, and seek the mandate to put the nation on the path
to double-digit growth for decades to come.

In practical terms, and as a first step, it requires the sale of the
government-owned banks and PSU‚Äôs in their entirety. Not re-capitalisation, not
mere NPA-resolution, not partial-disinvestment of loss-making PSU‚Äôs etc. A
complete sale. These are giant black holes that destroy capital, or at best,
use it sub-optimally. Modi cannot rebuild a nation without removing the
termites from its foundation.

By seizing the time still available in 2017-2019 (and perhaps for five years
thereafter), Modi may still live up to his own revolutionary declaration of
2014: ‚ÄúGovernment has no role in business‚Äù. Modi may represent the last best
hope for the Indian economy to achieve true greatness. If Modi doesn‚Äôt do it
now, India will be condemned to this middling, snakes-and-ladder growth
pattern for another several generations.

If not Modi, then who? If not now, then when?

The hedgehog knows.

Policy/Economy,[Policy] Creating Jobs in the Indian Economy,164,66u52j,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/66u52j/policy_creating_jobs_in_the_indian_economy/,82,"An AskIndia thread asked the same question. I replied without reading this person's entire post - which turned out to be trolling. So I'm reposting my comment here. It starts with some historical background, and ends with a comparative description of how other countries have performed.

---

**My Answer:** Clothes and Shoes

1. **Industrialization**: Historically, models of industrialisation have followed two pathways:
 * *Slow but Steady:* Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.
 * *Accelerated Growth:* economic successes mostly in East Asia began authoritarian, explicitly (Korea, China) or de facto (Singapore, Thailand, Taiwan), and gave way to political transformation only after a degree of economic success was achieved.

2. **Where does India Stand**: India has attempted economic development while also granting universal franchise from the very beginning. The only other countries in this group are Botswana, Mauritius, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Costa Rica ‚Äî all perennial democracies. At independence, India was one of the poorest nations, regardless of political system, with a per capita GDP of just $617 (PPP). This implies:
 * The Indian state has been ever burdened by the demands for redistribution since early in its life - leading to the poor state capacity we see today (healthcare, education, law enforcement).
 * There is a distrust of the Private Sector and over-reliance on Public capacity.
 * 'Exit', that is, winding down, declaring bankruptcy, and plugging inefficiencies is hard because of diverse stakeholders, vested interests, and poor institutions

3. **What Kind of Jobs does India Need:**  India needs to generate jobs that are formal and productive, provide bang-for-buck in terms of jobs created relative to investment, have the potential for broader social transformation, and can generate exports and growth. Apparel and Footwear sectors fit this bill.

4. **How have Apparel and Footwear worked for the East Asian Economies?** In the successful East Asian economies, countries where GDP growth booms averaged between 7-10 per cent, growth in the exports of these two sectors was exceptional. For comparison, over a 20 year period ""post-liberalisation"" for each economy:
 * Country|Year of Take-Off|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Apparel|Annual avg export growth for 20 years post take off (per cent) of Leather and Footwear|Annual avg economic growth for 20 years post take off (per cent)|
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
Korea|1962|30.4|69.9|9.0|
BGL|1985|27.9|29.8|5.2|
Thailand|1960|53.8|44.1|7.5|
Indonesia|1967|65.8|48.6|7.0|
Malaysia|1970|33.4|27.5|6.9|
China|1978|18.6|27.7|9.8|
Vietnam|1985|17.8|16.1|6.6|
India|1980|12.7|5.4|5.6|

5. **Why has India under-performed?** For a lot of historical, religious, and socio-cultural reasons. However, those pertinent to contemporary times include:
 * *Logistics*: Costs and Time for getting goods from factory-to-port are greater. Furthermore, Indian ports are unequipped to handle very large capacity containers. We use Sri Lankan ports for such transshipments.
 * *Labor Regulations*: Labor costs are low, but regulations strangulate formalization because of high overtime pay requirements, de facto EPF contribution taxes for low-paid workers, and inflexible firing policies.

 * *Tax and Tariff Policies*: India's domestic tax policies and unbalanced in that they promote cotton-based fibres instead of man-made fibres, which is the bulk of the global demand. Similarly, the global demand is for non-leather footwear, while India's share of global exports in leather footwear are double that of non-leather footwear (ie. it wrongly focuses on leather footwear)

 * *Export Market Discrimination*: EU and US impose customs tariffs on Indian apparel and footwear exports at ~10%, while it is 0% for Bangladesh. So Indian firms shift operations outside of India.

**What should India do? / What is it doing?** I'll add in this later if I see this post getting enough traction. Writing all of this took a lot of time in and of itself. If you have any suggestions, write away in the comments!",ringtring," There's a great recent episode on Rajya Sabha TV's ""State of the Economy"" where they discuss employment in India. It's just 24 minutes(skip the first 2 minutes of intro) and really goes into depth, yet in an accessible way. 

https://youtu.be/qAuBZQNpOV4?t=2m53s Since East Asia was mentioned... bit off-topic but can someone ELI5 how Japan became such a developed country after US completely fucked them over with the Tokyo firebombing and atomic bombings? What the fuck is happening today, back-to-back quality posts.

Very interesting read, yet to complete it but seems like it is gonna be educational.

 Some really interesting contributions here already. There is one crucial sector we might be overlooking though - public sector jobs, especially police, judiciary and healthcare workers. 

This is important, firstly, because most of our public services are so understaffed. There is massive log jamming in the judiciary for instance, scant police coverage in most areas, absolute lack of healthcare facilities in a large part of the country. An efficient economy can only be built in the foundation of a well functioning polity. A healthier, safer society is an absolute necessity for a healthy economy. 

Secondly, having more public sector jobs ends up creating more private jobs, especially in the service economy. 

The problem we run into when speaking of public sector is jobs is financing. This is a big problem. I believe fully staffing our public services is an investment. We don't question the need for physical infrastructure, we shouldn't for well staffed public services. Also, it's high time we did something about the shameful legacy of the past - housing our netas in palatial bungalows, the most expensive real estate in the country. Sell of Lutyens Delhi babu bungalows, create a fund, invest in human capital.  This should be a sticky post Economic Survey this year had a separate chapter on clothes and shoes, you should read that. EU Resident here. Most of the top quality branded clothes (hoodies, tshirts and jeans) we wear here and houseries (including IKEA) are actually made in Bangladesh.

If anyone can supply these products with same quality and similar price, I can create a few jobs in India. Good start. Admins should close the other troll/genocide thread. 

I'll try to divide my reply in two parts. The first where I reply to some of your points and the second where I'll try to write up some new parts which you didn't touch on.
__________________________________________________________

**First part**

> Slow but Steady: Western Economies

> Accelerated Growth: East Asia

This is actually somewhat inaccurate. As Dani Rodrik and many others have pointed out, *there has only been one single path to prosperity* for large economies which can't rely on fossil fuels or on tourism(like Trinidad and Tobago). That's the path of export-led manufacturing growth. 

Most people mistakenly think this is the ""East Asian"" model but this was how the UK, Germany and France all developed. Same is true with the US. Manufacturing was a huge part of the US economy up until perhaps the 1970s. 

Some people claim India can't replicate this model for two reasons. The first is automation/AI, which limits employment opportunity. The second is slow trade/protectionism. I'll be brief on both.

As far as AI/Automation is concerned, a lot of people have to understand that plenty of jobs that were counted as manufacturing in the past were actually service sector jobs. It's just that they were in the factory back in the old days. Today everything is hyper-specialised, so a lot of those jobs have moved out but are so-called ""auxiliary services"". They don't get counted with manufacturing today, but they should. If they were, job losses aren't nearly as bad as it's made out to be.

As for trade/protectionism is concerned, it's true that the world economy is growing slower than during the boom times, but historical perspective is needed. The average growth during the 1990s was slower than what the world economy is growing at right now. Korea, Taiwan and the other Asian tigers as well as Ireland and some Eastern European nations(Poland, Slovakia etc) had very rapid growth during this period, despite generally low global growth. So, I think this excuse doesn't really hold today. Yes, the opportunities are lower than in the 2000s, but from a historical perspective they are slightly above average.  Sadly our focus has been on cotton and yarn exports. At best fabrics and some niches like home textiles. We haven't been able to crack the apparels segment.

Our largest textile companies (measured in terms of investment or market cap) are yarn companies or home fabrics companies. 

In footwear we could have an edge in leather footwear, but this beef ban thing could be a detterant.  /u/ringtring your original post is good but I would like to point that Thailand, BGL(Bangladesh?), Malaysia and Indonesia are not under East Asia but under ASEAN. Few points.  

> Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. 

Semantic use of the term *in tandem* is not accurate enough plus the timelines are so broad they are meaningless.  

Using such broad terms one can even say that South Korea developed under this slow western model because it changed its system before it had become developed.  

The fact is the political development is a spectrum in itself and the West like US esp. was on the end of this spectrum closer to everyone else who developed than on the other end of it, where basically no one exists.  
Meaning, no one has ever developed under a democracy. And since democracies are of various types we need to provide context for it and that context was provided. Things like universal suffrage is a basic and easy metric(India is an older proper democracy than US in this manner), other can be used as well like the power holdings among a few rich homogeneous elites even despite the voting rights.  

As for the point on why India has under-performed.  

The fundamental reasons are that India has not followed the general path that leads to development. There is no Universal model for it but there are certain practices which are near-universal meaning they are de facto pre-requisite requirements.  

Things like having an Infrastructure in place before you set up a secondary and tertiary sector like Services and R&D.  
This a a dynamic which goes even beyond Industrialization. There is no development and stability without Infra development. Roads were the first things a new empire build.  
Then at the same time as this is Land reforms, its another prerequisite. There are plenty of evidence for this with countries that developed in the 20th century.  

Everything else comes afterwards. India is accumulating factors which are exceptional, things like Democracy from the get go, Tertiary sector before Infrastructure. Land reform not even done barring few places like Kerala.  

Its no wonder things wouldn't be smooth sailing. 

And about What India needs.  
I am of a different view. India should help where the people are and they are in the Primary sector, they are farmers. That is where the labor force is. Help them and you solve multiple problems. Problems like lack of jobs if everyone over the coming generations is supposed to enter the job pool. Problems like not enough capital for other major works which will become obsolete (exclusive factories are not a sound long term gambit). Problems like uprooting people in a country like India which is unique in terms of its diversity and already having massive population density issues.  

Helping the people in the agriculture sector is the biggest bang for the buck. It helps bring the HDI levels up, it helps the social security dynamic. It helps in the balanced development of all/majority people argument.   

Currently though there is no proper model for it. And this is where my views are different than most. India is already doing things in its own way. It is already the exception. It should look for new models of growth instead of relying on pre-exiting ones which may or may not really be that effective at the stage India is in. No model is universal, they have to be fitted to the place they are being implemented in. India should look for solutions which are novel and unique to its situation.   

Currently though India seems to have picked the same model of growth that has been used by majority of the world and that is Rapid Growth through fast tracked Urbanization. 10 years back Indian urbanization rate was less than 20%, now its reaching mid 30's.  
To me this goes against the India ethos and even practically its not sound for India given its unique spread of population over a smaller area and stressed natural resources.   When Koreans/Chinese started to make toys to be sold in the west, they never knew they would become some one like this. Indian ways of growing is not faulty, it can be considered as a new way. We have a lot problems which most previous governments ignored and China/Korea/US gave a lot of importance during early industrialization.

Industrialization needs infrastructure, skilled worker and rule of law which are missing in India.

* We have a pathetic infrastructure. Because the government doesn't want to anger people and politicians have a huge interest in infrastructure building, we could not build everything very quickly. Roads/Bridges/Ports/Railways are very slow and inefficient. Most people will not leave land easily. The environment must be protected. The contractors also make a lot of money by building everything slowly and of bad quality.

* Rural education is in a very bad condition. Most factory workers, construction crew usually come from rural areas. In India, most of them are very unskilled and difficult to be trained.

* Inefficient governance is also another reason. Our state is very backward. It takes days for people to get the documents and months for companies. Bureaucrats usually don't work for people unless someone attacks them. Law enforcement is also very bad. 

 This post and the discussion that it brought fold is gold! I've been through the entire thread and this is some real quality discussion. Thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion. ‚ò∫Ô∏è Reading it has been a pleasure. 

It's disheartening that the comments don't have as many points and the ones in the political threads do.  One area prime for reforms and job creation I feel is agriculture. I think India is employing a huge proportion of it's population in farming and yet it's very inefficient, maybe the latter is the cause for former. I think agriculture can be leveraged to bring jobs to rural areas bu investing in rural infrastructure creation, warehouses and storage, distribution and transportation and food processing. This coupled with building human resource capital in rural and semi-urban areas be it teachers. public transportation workers, support personnels etc. 

Manufacturing should be our main focus and we should focus on both domestic oriented and export oriented manufacturing.  >  Where Western Advanced economies like the USA & UK undertook economic development in tandem with political development. They did not begin with universal franchise. This helped fiscal and economic development by limiting the initial demands on the state during the period when its capacity was weak.

As far as UK is concerned, what period was the capacity weak & when did it become strong? I don't think India has an  unemployment problem It just has people who don't want to work.  ",2017-04-22 17:49:09
Policy/Economy,Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud,98,6c2b6n,http://www.ndtv.com/opinion/modis-approach-to-china-has-done-us-proud-1695284,62,,Bennelong," Is BARF really the abbreviation for it? Lmao ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**It‚Äôs time Modi government stopped blaming RBI**

Overall, the Narendra government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Photo: PTI

Before the six-member committee that sets monetary policy for the Reserve Bank of India met this week, the government in New Delhi made its preferences very clear. Two members of Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs economic advisory council‚Äîa body that he did without for a long time, but which was recently reconstituted following several policy stumbles‚Äîpublicly declared that real interest rates were too high. But the RBI committee held firm and kept India‚Äôs policy interest rate at six percent.

This could have been, and was, predicted. India‚Äôs central bank is now officially supposed to be targeting consumer price inflation and nothing else; the government agreed to this change over a year ago. And inflation has been inching up, driven by higher prices for food and fuel. In October, consumer price inflation was the highest in seven months.

Formal requirements apart, of course, it would‚Äôve been hard for the central bank to ignore the government‚Äôs pleas if the economy were stalled. But the government achieved something of a victory last week when GDP growth in the second quarter of 2017 came in at 6.3%, slightly faster than in the first quarter. That eliminated pressure on the RBI to cut rates and stimulate investment. Instead, the central bank‚Äôs priority is guarding against the possibility that higher growth will begin to affect wages‚Äîand, in particular, real estate prices, which the RBI singled out for attention in its policy statement.

This illustrates the government‚Äôs great dilemma. Growth in India never quite slows down enough to make crisis measures necessary. Yet it never quite speeds up enough to satisfy the aspirations of Modi, his party and his voters (not to mention his critics). The couple things the government has gotten right in the past few months‚Äîits attempts to streamline the new goods-and-services tax and its determined approach to cleaning up distressed assets‚Äîhaven‚Äôt been dramatic enough either to ease the RBI‚Äôs worries or to push the economy to a permanently higher growth path.

Overall, this government has muddled through, producing a middling policy record and a middling growth record. Now it‚Äôs clear that the RBI won‚Äôt bail it out; the best chance for lower rates may have passed. Any revival of private investment‚Äîwhich, as a proportion of GDP, was even lower in the second quarter than the first‚Äîwill have to come from somewhere else.

Frankly, if the government is serious about a growth revival, it will have to return to the drawing board. It still has time and political capital to spare before it has to face the voters in 2019. There is an entire set of reforms that it hasn‚Äôt touched since its first few months in power: to India‚Äôs problematic labour markets, for example, or to the ways available to industry and developers to acquire agricultural land.

Recently, India‚Äôs richest man, Mukesh Ambani, insisted that India would become a $10-trillion dollar economy by 2030. That would mean moving toward double-digit growth in dollar terms very soon. Yet there‚Äôs no indication of that on the horizon. Frankly, the signs to me aren‚Äôt propitious. While the growth slowdown may have reversed, part of that was simply a dead-cat bounce. Manufacturers who had stopped production to de-stock before the introduction of the new GST started up again in the second quarter. That‚Äôs hardly sustainable.

Nor is the government capable of intervening itself to prop up growth. In fact, it‚Äôs running out of money to keep stimulating the economy: It has already run through most of its fiscal deficit cushion for the year, and the RBI flagged the fiscal stresses caused by higher pay for government employees and Indian states‚Äô mad competition to forgive agricultural debt. Nor are there really any signs, even anecdotally, of renewed investment in India‚Äôs private sector.

It‚Äôs hard to see 6.3% growth as a major achievement in India. As the RBI pointed out, it‚Äôs not a disaster. But, if the government is honest with itself, it‚Äôs not a triumph either. It‚Äôs time that Modi, his ministers and his advisers turned to the many reforms they‚Äôve left pending‚Äîand stopped blaming the RBI. Bloomberg View

 ______ 
If economic policies are managed well India will be a powerhouse economy, IMF
has said

**Washington: **

India can become a powerhouse economy if policies are managed well and reforms
are supportive of inclusive growth, a top IMF official has said.

David Lipton, the International Monetary Fund's First Deputy Managing
Director, also expressed hope that India's growth will be reflected in poverty
reduction statistics and eventually in a measurement of metrics of inclusion.

""If policies are managed well and reforms are supportive of inclusive growth,
India's economy could become a powerhouse economy. It is already, I think the
10th largest, but with the population and the growth rate there's more
potential,"" he told news agency PTI.

""I've said there's more to be done. There are further reforms both in terms of
consolidating the budget situation to ensure that there's never an incident of
doubt about fiscal finances in terms of making the banking system more
competitive and dealing with the legacy problems of NPAs (non- performing
assets),"" he said.

He said the important job was not just to recapitalise, but to change the
governance and change the competitiveness so that banks serve as a positive
force by allocating credit well and being a driving force in the economy .

__ Comments

Asked about IMF Managing Director Christine Lagarde's remarks that she does
not expect any major economic reforms in an election year, Mr Lipton said:
""It's always a difficult to make policy during election years.

""We certainly hope that there can continue to be a progress, but it's really
the judgement of the politicians, the government about what can be done when"".

**Have to take temporary pain for long-term gain: VP Venkaiah Naidu on economy** 

 ______ 
Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo) Venkaiah Naidu said that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned. (File photo)

At a time when the Narendra Modi-led central government is battling a public perception of economic mismanagement, Vice-President Venkaiah Naidu on Friday threw his weight behind the present dispensation and said the country has to face temporary pain for long-term gain.

‚ÄúThe temporary things‚Ä¶ there will be some problem. Of course, you have to take temporary pain for long term gain. I am not getting into this arena. There are other people who are debating, using their skills, forgetting what they have done, what has to be done, what needs to be done,‚Äù Vice President Naidu said.

The Vice-President also stated that there has to be a broader consensus as far as foreign and economic policies are concerned.

Maintaining that even China is witnessing a slowdown in its economy, Naidu said that the global economy has slowed down and added that India remains a bright spot‚Äùin the midst of this‚Äù.

His reaction comes days after senior BJP leader and former finance minister Yashwant Sinha launched an attack on the government over handling of the economy. Sinha in his article in The Indian Express had blamed Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for the ‚Äúmess‚Äù in the economy. He wrote that the economy is in a downward spiral, its revival unlikely by the 2019 elections and a ‚Äúhard landing appears inevitable.

Later in the day, at a book launch event in New Delhi, Naidu talked on several issues. On terrorsim he said, ‚ÄúTerrorism has no religion, caste, creed.‚Äù

He further said, ‚ÄúReligion is used to mislead the younger generation, we should be wary of this. We should educate and enlighten people on evil effects of terrorism, how much it costs. Every country should speak in one voice. Political parties within the country also should speak with one voice, they shouldn‚Äôt try to score brownie political points.‚Äù

Naidu said, ‚ÄúBullet can never bring change. If even if it brings change temporarily, it will not sustain. It is the ballot which is powerful than bullet in democracy, that has been proven. The society should discourage acts by people taking to arms and then trying to achieve there state political goal.‚Äù

Policy/Economy,Booster shot for economy: GST rates to be cut on 60 goods and services.,92,74kzl4,http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/gst-council-set-to-ease-processes-for-smes-on-friday-2405561.html,14,,appu_or," Behn ... maslaa rate ka nahi, GST ke rule aur infrastructure ka hai. But wasn't there nothing wrong with the economy as the government insisted? Then why these changes? How many fucking changes will these clowns make? One of the big confusion going on already is regarding different tax rates for products and this is going to get a whole lot worse when tax slabs for 60 more products are changed. Then there are million other doubts regarding actual filing, refund, exports, website acting wonky, zero support from CBEC etc 

The sheer number of changes that have to be done on this half baked tax regime shows how poorly it was conceptualised and implemented. It feels as if someone who has no idea how the country's economy works sat down and came up with the garbage known as GST act. 

Mudi and Jaitley should be ashamed and issue an unconditional apology to corporate India. Shame on these chaiwalas and morons   You still have to file 3 times a month and get extremely confused as you try to figure out the rate for various good. Its been 3 fucking years since gst bill was introduced in parliament and another couple since it was proposed by UPA, why is it so fucking hard to come up with a sane and sensible taxes You know what is worse than impractical draconian rules and business breaking taxes??

Uncertainty. If the above is cancer, but Uncertainty is basically a bullet to the head. 

MSMEs don't have a legal team to go through all the everchanging rules. You motherfuckers  should understand we have other responsibilities and headaches to operate our businesses. You have all the resources one could get and still can't come up with a reasonable policy after multiple meetings.

Policy/Economy,"Cashless economy is a boon, says Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus",81,5mivsr,http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/Cashless-economy-is-a-boon-says-Nobel-laureate-Muhammad-Yunus/article16994985.ece,72,,indianpolicy," Of course it is,  but you need to first provide basic electricity and Internet and educate the masses before aggressively adopting it.  That's like saying calculus is very important and forcing children to learn it without teaching them algebra.  Even Muslims are turning into Modi agents. Their bhakti knows no bounds. /s this can not b digested by modi bashers A cashless economy is the ONLY way to win the war on black money.  Demonitization attacks stores of existing cash and forces people to learn new methods of payments.  But in the long term, it is only when the government can track each and every transaction that a person makes at the click of a button that the capacity to generate future black money will be drastically reduced.  (and yes, I'm ignoring other benefits of cashless economy such as lack of printing/storage/productivity wasted by getting and storing cash, etc)

Of course he is going to say cashless economy is a boon - Any economist who says going cashless for is bad is a fucking moron. Cashless economy is a boon however shoving it down people's throat by a democratic government isn't. The large majority of those bearing the brunt of demonetization policies are precisely the ones that aren't paying their legal share of taxes regardless of the infrastructure and systems that do facilitate their livelihoods. We live in a country where tax administration only reaches a small fraction of the population.

I'm not accusing them, I'm merely stating a fact. Having lived income-tax-free for decades means they've paid less than their expected share toward national interest. Subsequently having to change money and lose a sum in the transaction one day, or having to suffer the inconvenience of setting up a bank account isn't an unreasonable consequence. 

Many of them are poor but taxes are in some sense an investment for our peoples' future; having a functional society or lift hundreds of millions from poverty will require a budget. Generally speaking, we can have a drawn-out process of social and technological modernization and prolong poverty, or we can do more in shorter order with more resources. This is not something to be contested, this is all obvious, yet people will waste time arguing even the most basic logic.

We should be as creative as we can in our solutions to mitigate the costs of modernization. But there are few low-hanging fruit that will effect meaningful reform on national scale. It is true, one such demonetization even will not break the effect of black money on India; but as one piece of commitment to a multi-pronged, long-term strategy, we can make it work.

The key has to be that someone does something. Government in India often does not meet even this most basic requirement with respect to facilitating our social or technological development. We can argue day and night about everything, always starting from square one, always starting from the most basic philosophical assumptions, but we're guaranteed nothing will change if nothing is attempted.
Perhaps Modi has not done everything he could or should, maybe we can question his motives all day and night, but he has begun doing something, taking some calculated, novel risk, to produce national momentum. He has justified his own salary in some small way.

**India not China is among the fastest growing economies** 

 ______ 
The latest World Bank report about the economic health of the member countries clearly says that while India is among the fastest growing economies - big and small, China is not doing as well.

Chinese economy is slowing down. In its latest report, the World Bank has said, ""The continued gradual slowdown in China will slightly offset a pickup in the rest of the region led by a rebound among commodity exporters. Growth in China is anticipated to slow to 6.5 percent this year and 6.3 percent in 2018.""

According to the World Bank's latest edition of the Global Economic Prospects, India is the fourth fastest growing economy in the world. China shows a clear sign of slowdown and ranks at number 16 in terms of GDP growth rate.

INDIA PICKING UP

The World Bank has pegged India's growth rate at 7.2 for the current year on the back of rising export and increase in government spending.

Writing in the June edition of the Global Economic Prospects, the The World Bank analysts said, ""In India, recent data indicate an acceleration in growth, with an easing of cash shortages and a rise in exports. An increase in government spending, including on capital formation, has partially offset soft private investment.""

According to the World Bank, ""India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 per cent in fiscal 2017 (April 1, 2017 - March 31, 2018) and 7.5 per cent in the following fiscal year. Domestic demand is expected to remain strong, supported by policy reforms.""

CHINA SLIPS

In terms of growth rate, India is placed behind smaller economies of Estonia, Uzbekistan and Nepal. On the other hand, China failed to secure a place in the top 15 economies in terms of GDP growth rate.

The World Bank said, that though China has shown recovery in exports and the robust consumption pattern has helped it grow at 6.9 per cent in the first quarter, Beijing's slowdown is pulling down the east Asian region. Other countries in the region are showing better growth rates.

The World Bank has also expressed concern about exacerbating financial vulnerabilities of China on account of ""elevated domestic debt.""

According to the World Bank, the policy uncertainty in the United States and Europe is likely to impact Chinese growth rate more adversely. The trade, immigration and fiscal policies of the US are under review by the Donald Trump administration.

Similarly, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union carries financial risks that could weigh on heavily on the China's growth prospects.

Fitch also warned that large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment. File photo: Bloomberg

New Delhi: Fitch Ratings has lowered India‚Äôs economic growth forecast for the current fiscal to 6.9% from 7.4% after the gross domestic product (GDP) growth ‚Äúunexpectedly faltered‚Äù in the April-June quarter.

The credit rating agency said however that it expects the economic activity to accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year with the waning impact of one-off events including the demonetisation shock in late 2016 and the goods and services tax (GST) rollout in July, which had dampened growth in the short term.

‚ÄúThe large stock of non-performing loans on bank balance sheets could, however, dampen the outlook for credit growth and business investment,‚Äù Fitch Ratings in its latest global economic outlook (GEO). The Asian Development Bank (ADB) had last month slashed India‚Äôs GDP growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7% from 7.4% owing to weakness in private consumption, manufacturing output and business investment.

India had posted a 7.1% growth in 2016-17. ADB pencilled in 7.4% for 2018-19, down from the earlier forecast of 7.6% in July. Fitch Ratings said the global economy has improved markedly this year and is on course to recording its fastest expansion since 2010.

India‚Äôs GDP growth at 5.7% in the first quarter (April-June), down from 6.1% in the previous year, is ‚Äúthe lowest outturn since early 2013, and GDP has now been cooling for five consecutive quarters‚Äù, it said. Economic activity in the quarter, it said, may have been disrupted by firms running down inventory ahead of the implementation of the GST in July.

The manufacturing sector lost steam in the quarter, growing at a meagre 1.2% year-on-year. The primary sector also dampened growth, while construction and tertiary activity bounced back. On the expenditure side, net trade was a big drag on growth, with exports decelerating sharply (after an admittedly strong January-March print) and import growth remaining buoyant (at 13.4% year-on-year).

‚ÄúIn light of the poor 1H17 (first half of 2017) outturns, we have downgraded our forecast for FY17-18 (year-ending March 2018) to 6.9 per cent, a cut of 0.5 percentage points compared to the June GEO,‚Äù Fitch said.

Forecasting acceleration in activity in the second half of the current fiscal, it said consumption should drive the pick-up in growth. ‚ÄúMotorcycle sales ‚Äî a good indicator of rural household consumption ‚Äî have gained strong momentum, bouncing back in July and August after having fallen sharply in 1H17. Investment is also expected to tick up in the quarters ahead, in part bolstered by ramped-up public sector infrastructure spending,‚Äù Fitch said.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) cut its policy rate to 6% in August, resuming the monetary easing cycle initiated in early 2015. ‚ÄúHowever, monetary policy loosening has taken place in the context of rapidly falling inflation, implying that the RBI‚Äôs policy stance as measured by the real policy rate has not been so accommodative,‚Äù it added.

The global economy has improved markedly this year but the current favourable mix of strong growth and highly accommodative macro policies could be as good as it gets, it said. ‚ÄúOur forecasts imply something of a ‚Äòsweet spot‚Äô for the global economy in 2017 and 2018 with above-trend growth and still highly accommodative global monetary policies. However, this is not a pattern we expect to persist into 2019 and beyond as output gaps close in advanced economies and monetary policy support is withdrawn,‚Äù said Brian Coulton, Fitch‚Äôs chief economist.

Global growth has been upgraded to 3.1% in 2017 from 2.9% in June, and 2018 growth has been upgraded to 3.2% from 3.1%.

Harsh truth..... > Mr Lawrence Summers, the former US treasury secretary, writing in the Financial Times, described the move as **""the most sweeping change in currency policy that has occurred anywhere in the world in decades""**.

Very superficial. The Straits Times is the defacto propaganda machine for the government of Singapore. Articles like these ought to be taken with a pinch of salt. Original Article

> Until last month. On Nov 8, corruption came under the crosshairs of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, with his decision to cull the two highest-denomination banknotes, the 500-rupee and the 1,000-rupee notes (roughly S$10 and S$20) from circulation. By value they made up around 85 per cent of Indian currency.

> When the move was announced in a 40-minute televised address to the nation, most of the world was watching another democracy poised at a decisive point - the election between Mr Donald Trump and Mrs Hillary Clinton.
> 
> Mr Modi presented his policy as a chance for every citizen to fight corruption. The underlying logic was that these were the notes used most often by the corrupt, who evade taxes and fuel an underground economy. Known in India as black money, this parallel economy is estimated by the World Bank to be at least one-fifth the size of India's gross domestic product. Notes in these denominations were also found to be counterfeited by terrorists and used to pay for bombs and bombers.

But this is by no means a popular demand. It's almost as though a nation, its great promise betrayed time and again by poor leadership, has stretched a cautious hand to Mr Modi.
> 
> Opinion in the media has been less forgiving. One month into demonetisation, economists say the move will hit India's growth rate, with evidence mounting of shrinking manufacturing and consumer spending. Fears are that crop harvests will be hit too, because farmers are in bank queues when they should be in the fields for the winter sowing season.

Mr Kaushik Basu, a former World Bank chief economist, writing in The New York Times, called it a major mistake, albeit a well-intentioned one. Popular Times of India columnist Shobhaa De wrote that Mr Modi was living in a bubble, ""an isolated, lonely man"" committing ""political harakiri"".

> 
> In its sheer ambition, Mr Modi's move compares to American president Franklin D. Roosevelt's dismantling of the gold standard, with which he pulled the US out of the Great Depression. Roosevelt jolted the Americans in April 1933 when he gave them about a month in which to exchange gold - coins, bullion, certificates - at the Federal Reserve for US$20.67 an ounce. Two months later, the government delinked the dollar from its gold reserves, discarding the monetary norm of half a century which was preventing it from aggressively pumping in money needed to revive the tailspinning economy.
> 
> Post-independence, India has seen only one other action of this magnitude to alter the trajectory of the nation - prime minister P V Narasimha Rao's economic liberalisation in the 1990s, which reversed decades of socialist policies and steered an almost bankrupt India to globalisation.
> 
> Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru and others among the first generation of post-colonial Indian leaders were influenced by Western thought and recognised the need for modernisation. While Gandhi, the father of the nation, forswore any role in policy or government after independence, Nehru delighted in Western ideals. He enthusiastically brought home the progressive mores of the time, turning India into a planned, protected economy, with decidedly mixed results. In contrast, the second generation of Asia's leaders, such as Singapore's first prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, saw the merits of the West but also its pitfalls and drew upon their own cultures, with startling economic success.
> 
> Mr Modi's attempt to combat corruption, if rewarded with even a measure of success, could unleash India's potential by consolidating all economic activity. Consider that astonishingly few Indians, just 1 per cent, pay income tax. The country ranks 76th out of 168 in Transparency International's corruption perception index - a shameful place for a democracy and emerging economy to occupy.
> 
> However, Mr Modi's crusade can be undermined by the toxic political baggage he carries. Nurtured by a Hindu militant organisation and espousing nationalist ideas, Mr Modi was the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat during the 2002 communal riots, in which more than a thousand people, mostly Muslims, lost their lives.
> 
> On the other hand, technology is his greatest friend. His demonetisation move has swiftly morphed into a push for digitisation which will make the economy more efficient and transparent at one stroke.
> 
> In a country of 1.2 billion, a cashless economy is a distant goal. There are fewer than 1.5 million machines that can handle card transactions in stores. Some 1,800 people share one machine in India, compared to 60 in China and 25 in the US. More Indians than Americans are online these days, just behind the number of users in China, but that looks more impressive than it is. Only 13 out of 100 rural Indians have Internet access. One of two - 600 million people - still do not have bank accounts. And half of them have no government ID required to open a bank account.
> 
> If it continues to go forward, the push against corruption has the potential to eventually bolster India's place as an engine for world growth even as China falters.

If all transactions are taxed, we will get a lot of tax money . 

Now we don't really have sufficient money to build infrastructure, and with money we can do now.

Some people complain that the poor people are in trouble, farmers are standing in a queue, no money to pay factory workers.

I just want to know where was your sympathy, when farmers were committing suicide and factory workers are underpaid. We may have to face a reduced GDP growth this year, things will be better next year.

As for the windfall gain arguments, we'll just have to wait and see. We already drank the kool-aid once when we were prepared to believe that 30% or so of the demonetized currency wouldn't be coming back. Now about 80% is back with two weeks still to go.

Jagdish Bhagwati, Pravin Krishna,Suresh SundaresanOn November 8 Prime Minister Narendra Modi delivered a surprise reform to the nation: the government declared that the high-denomination 500 and 1000 rupee notes, which constituted more than 85% of currency outstanding in value, would be invalid as legal tender and could only be deposited into bank accounts until the end of the year.This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.



This is a courageous and substantive economic reform that, despite the significant transition costs, has the potential to generate large future benefits.India is largely a cash-driven economy, though a rapidly growing percentage of the population is becoming tech savvy. A shadow economy reliant on cash transactions and evading taxes, especially on high value transactions such as real estate purchases, gold, and intrinsically illegal activity, has taken deep and highly persistent root. Counterfeiting of Indian rupee notes and their subsequent use in funding of terrorist activities has also been an important concern.

This is incorrect, as the policy allows for the exchange of old notes for new notes. Although the process is inconvenient, and subjects many households to hardships, it forces the cash from the black economy to be deposited into the banking system, potentially increasing transparency and expanding the tax base and revenues to the government from taxes and surcharges.

The argument that the policy is anti-poor is suspect as a significant fraction of the taxes and surcharges that will be collected from the reform initiative is to be allocated to social programmes.

On the contrary, this action has been taken by duly elected officials within the framework of a democracy.To be effective, the policy required an element of surprise. Given this surprise factor and the magnitude of the reform, the rollout of the policy has generated predictable hardships.The shortage of new currency notes and limits on withdrawals has led to considerable anxiety about wage and pension payments, and cash financing of even routine household expenditures. The frequent changes in rules during the past month, over how money deposited into accounts will be taxed, how much money may be withdrawn and which exemptions would apply, for instance, have led to unnecessary confusion.

Several recent developments suggest that the demonetisation drive may well yield significant benefits.First, around 80% of the currency in higher denominations has now been deposited back into bank accounts. Since individual deposits will now be matched with their tax returns and unaccounted deposits will be taxed, this will yield a windfall for the government permitting large increases in social expenditures.

**Living in denial** 

 ______ 
The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so.

Delhi‚Äôs denials of reality would be funny if it weren‚Äôt for the tragic consequences. On the economy, this denial dates back to 2012 when Manmohan Singh was in charge and Rahul Gandhi has only now underlined that unemployment was the problem. Yashwant Sinha has edited a book on The Future of the Indian Economy and documented the continuing crisis.

Employment is only a part of the story. Arvind Panagariya was more direct. The corporate sector has performed well, he said. Investment output and employment have been rising. He took averages to make comparisons, which is not good statistics for analysis of short-run changes, for if there are three numbers 5, 10 and 15, the average is 5 but there is wild oscillation. Panagariya has written a good book on the Indian economy but he is not a great statistician. His use of averages to force the argument that the blip last year and this year will be reversed is flawed. Fortunately, his successor, Rajiv Kumar, says it is difficult but doable.

The deceleration of growth in 2012 was policy induced. The trouble later was equally so. The economy decelerated and voters correctly placed the blame on the UPA government and voted it out. Rahul Gandhi is absolutely correct in accepting the mistake on behalf of the then ruling party and saying that it needs to be corrected. Panagariya is too good an economist to ignore the non-corporate sector and its importance in the economy when the corporate sector is less than a tenth of the economy. In terms of output and employment, the non-corporate sector is important because jobs are created there. But for the sake of debating points, the fact that the national accounts data doesn‚Äôt show a rosy picture and includes performance of the non-corporate sector, was slurred over. Yashwant Sinha has also started a debate and in a piece in these columns established that the reversal of the slowdown was simply not there.

S. Gurumurthy had the courage to say that since Atal Bihari Vajpayee‚Äôs days, employment has been on the back burner. Half a problem is solved if a mistake is admitted and an amendment is made. But the empire struck back. On Rahul, a commentator close to the establishment said that speeches in America won‚Äôt matter in eastern UP. Another said that Berkeley and the Ivy League schools don‚Äôt matter. I went to the University of Pennsylvania, and also taught there, including at Wharton and Swarthmore College. Working as I do in Gujarat from 1968, I hold the motel owner-NRIs in high esteem. Many are engineers and so on, who went into motels since other options were not there when they settled in America, and being intelligent and well-trained, made a success of them. But the Ivy League and the professional crowd is also important, have strong connections at home and their opinion is respected in India. In fact, they remain more often than not more connected with India than the motel NRIs and so should definitely not be ignored.

Sinha asked the beleaguered establishment to get back to the drawing board. One commentator strangely argued that he was wrong because real rural wages have been rising. Abhijit Sen, now back at JNU, had pointed out a decade ago that the rural wage rate is rising but unemployment is there in a big way. This conundrum needs to be worked on rather than being wished away. Another commentator was to argue that imports are rising so Sinha must be wrong, but we are a continental economy. A senior minister could only abuse Sinha; strange since the finance and planning ministries have been known for their professional stance.

One can only hope that the policy response will be more professional. The so-called stimulus package should not just give us lectures on reform. Someday, we will get to one or maybe two rates and have a real GST, which then, after six months, will start working. Until then, we can call it a GST but with five rates it‚Äôs not unlike a sales tax. Some day, the demonetisation effects will wear off. Also please don‚Äôt end it all by telling the ministries to spend more efficiently based on existing financial allocations. If reports are correct, the captive secretary saying ‚Äòyes sir‚Äô must have gone out sniggering.

Efficiency doesn‚Äôt improve by lectures. Assuming that working styles will remain more or less the same, design a real stimulus. If you do your job and raise demand, the economy will respond magnificently.

Policy/Economy,India‚Äôs Demonetization Debacle,78,5it1gn,http://www.wsj.com/articles/indias-demonetization-debacle-1481851086,18,,abhishekraghunath," In case of paywall

____________________________________________________

Nearly six weeks after India abruptly scrapped high-denomination banknotes accounting for about 85% of its currency by value, the economy continues to slow. Poor and middle-class Indians are still suffering from the shortage of new bills. But the most significant casualty may well be Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs reputation as a sound economic manager.

On Nov. 8, Mr. Modi announced that India‚Äôs two highest-denomination currency bills‚Äî1,000 rupees ($14.84) and 500 rupees‚Äîwould immediately cease to be legal tender in most places. Holders have until the end of the year to deposit these bills into bank accounts. As replacements, the government has slowly rolled out a redesigned 500-rupee bill and a new 2,000-rupee bill.

The long-term effects of India‚Äôs demonetization gambit remain unclear, largely because no other major economy has attempted such an experiment except during a crisis. But with growth slowing and job losses rising, the short-term prognosis appears grim.

Instead of factory openings or large new investments, the images that tell India‚Äôs current economic story include snaking lines outside banks, distressed workers migrating back to their villages, and tax raids on jewelers and officials caught with hoards of allegedly illicit cash.

The policy‚Äôs shabby implementation‚Äîthrough an avalanche of amendments, rollbacks and patchwork fixes‚Äîundercuts Mr. Modi‚Äôs reputation for quiet efficiency. It also underscores his overreliance on India‚Äôs notoriously heavy-handed bureaucrats.

Demonetization has resurrected fears that the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party takes policy advice from quacks. It damaged the credibility of India‚Äôs central bank. And it forced many of the country‚Äôs ostensibly right-of-center intellectuals to perform advanced mental gymnastics to defend the prime minister. Though a few economists have applauded Mr. Modi, the weight of informed opinion leans heavily against his decision.

Not surprisingly, shock waves from the announcement continue to crash through the economy. The Asian Development Bank cut its growth estimate for India for the financial year ending March 31 to 7% from 7.4%. JP Morgan expects growth to decline by half a percent to 6.7%.

Meanwhile, falling sales have begun to translate into layoffs spanning various sectors, including construction, textiles and jewelry. The Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy estimates the transaction costs alone of swapping out an estimated 14.2 trillion rupees‚Äô worth of currency to be 1.28 trillion rupees, or about $19 billion.

India‚Äôs economy will eventually recover from this self-inflicted wound, but there‚Äôs no question that demonetization has created doubts about Mr. Modi‚Äôs competence. The decision, reportedly hatched in secret with a coterie of trusted bureaucrats, showcases the prime minister‚Äôs faith in the command-and-control ethos of the civil service rather than in the ‚Äúminimum government‚Äù he once promised.

It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs. The loudest backers of demonetization include a telegenic yoga guru, a chartered accountant best known for propounding the homespun economic philosophy of ‚Äúswadeshi,‚Äù or self-reliance, and a nongovernmental organization that wants almost all taxes to be replaced by a single levy on bank transactions.

Already, a flurry of commentary by well-regarded Indian and global commentators has tarnished the prime minister‚Äôs image. The business journalist T.N. Ninan calls demonetization ‚Äúa bad idea, badly executed on the basis of some half-baked notions.‚Äù For Morgan Stanley‚Äôs Ruchir Sharma, Mr. Modi‚Äôs ‚Äúclumsy exercise of state power‚Äù won‚Äôt achieve its ostensible aim‚Äîcracking down on so-called ‚Äúblack money‚Äù salted away by tax dodgers. Kaushik Basu, a former chief economic advisor to the government of India and former chief economist at the World Bank, calls the policy ‚Äúpoorly designed, with scant attention paid to the laws of the market.‚Äù

To be sure, not everyone thinks demonetization is a disaster. Columbia University‚Äôs Jagdish Bhagwati calls it ‚Äúa courageous and substantive economic reform‚Äù whose potential benefits include shrinking the shadow economy, hurting terrorists and counterfeiters, and expanding the tax base by digitizing many economic transactions.

Others argue that this is likely only the first of a series of reforms that will eventually simplify tax administration, root out corruption and make campaign finances more transparent. Some supporters view demonetization as a quick way to invigorate a sluggish banking sector with cheap funds.

Perhaps the optimists will be proved right, but at this point their gauzy hopes of future benefits must be weighed against the present pain. Even if demonetization ends up producing some gains, the question of whether it was worth its considerable costs will linger. Moreover, the simple fact that no credible expert suggested such a drastic policy before Mr. Modi announced it makes many arguments in its support look like belated apologia.

Two and a half years ago, based on his record as the business-friendly chief minister of Gujarat, Mr. Modi stormed to national power as India‚Äôs great economic hope. At least for now, the demonetization debacle has shaken this assumption to its foundations.

 > It also shows how susceptible Mr. Modi and his aides are to the unorthodox ideas of assorted cranks and oddballs from the Hindu nationalist movement to which the BJP belongs.

Time to bury the myth of competent Modi once and for all. Modi is totally out of his depth ffs. He's so incompetent. This is some Rahul Gandhi level shit Modi will probably start a war with Pakistan soon to distract everyone. The country‚Äôs bungling effort to cut down on cash has undermined Narendra Modi‚Äôs credibility, says Sadanand Dhume in The Wall Street Journal.

No wonder garibi did not get removed.

Guess people who throw the word jumla for Modi/BJP forget the mother of all jumlas. Bhai the 'i' at the end of garibi was a spelling error

It was supposed to be 'garib hatao' Obviously. Anyone who looked past the 'pro-poor' rhetoric and actually looked at how India's socialist system worked could see why it couldn't remove poverty: In the name of 'equality' it concentrated all of India's resources in the hands of a small elite of government officials and chosen industrialists.

On 19 November, the Congress party kick-started celebrations to commemorate the birth centenary year of Indira Gandhi (hereafter referred to as Gandhi).

At a time when BJP is championing the image of prime minister Narendra Modi as a strong and decisive leader, the Congress party would be hoping to use Gandhi‚Äôs legacy to counter the ruling party and prime minister.

In an interview to India Today Television, Congress president Sonia Gandhi dismissed theories which equate Narendra Modi and Gandhi. While there is nothing new in the political slugfest being played out, a more interesting question is how should one evaluate Gandhi‚Äôs economic policies?

To analyse the performance of the Indian economy under Gandhi‚Äôs leadership, we have divided the post-independence period into three parts: 1952-1966, 1966-1984 and 1984 onwards. Gandhi was the prime minister from 1966-84 barring the period from 1977-1980. A simple comparison of growth rates shows that agricultural growth under Indira Gandhi‚Äôs tenure is the highest India has ever achieved. While overall growth rates have increased overtime in India, industry‚Äôs performance was the worst during Gandhi‚Äôs tenure.

In terms of per capita incomes, India started lagging behind China and southeast Asia when Gandhi was at the helm of affairs.

Gandhi‚Äôs own political rhetoric was more tilted towards providing a welfare state rather than delivering high growth, exemplified in her coining of the slogan Garibi Hatao (Eradicate Poverty). A reading of multiple Indian poverty estimates shows that poverty has declined at a much faster rate in post-reform India despite the dismantling of many of Gandhi‚Äôs policies. To be sure, there is a big debate on whether India‚Äôs current poverty lines guarantee adequate consumption and well-being levels. However, there is a broad agreement on the fact that poverty has declined faster in post-Gandhi India.

One statistic, which underlines the need for exercising caution vis-√†-vis the positive picture painted by declining poverty figures is the rapid rise in inequality in India in the post-reform period. In fact, India was a more equal society than southeast Asia during Gandhi‚Äôs period. This trend has reversed itself today.

If there is one policy implemented by Gandhi which has left the most enduring impact on India‚Äôs political economy, it is the nationalisation of banks, which created a huge public sector bank network in India. The process was accomplished in two stages, first in 1969 and later in 1980.

Public sector banks have played a major role in the current problem of bad loans which plagues the Indian economy. Given the nexus between politicians controlling banks and businessmen, bank nationalisation policy is seen as a major culprit for the bad loan problem facing the Indian economy today. Public sector rigidities have also been seen as an obstacle to hiring talented executives and improving efficiency in India‚Äôs state owned banks.

However, it is also a fact that nationalisation of banks helped in furthering financial inclusion and improved access to institutional credit for people who did not have access to it earlier. Financial intermediation increased sharply in the post-nationalisation period. The state-led expansion of banking also helped in a doubling of savings rate in the economy from 10 percent in 1970s to 20% in 1980s. An increase in savings rate is seen as a crucial requirement for increasing investment and growth rate in any economy.

Caution should be observed in a mechanical reading of the statistics cited above as many policies often affect the economy with a lag. In fact, various economists have pointed towards the need to understand the complexities of political economy factors which drove economic growth in India. A 2004 National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) working paper by Harvard economist Dani Rodrik and India‚Äôs Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian argues that the pro-business shift in Gandhi‚Äôs policies post 1980 was crucial in the growth rate picking up in the Indian economy. Similarly, a 2003 paper by Niti Aayog‚Äôs vice chairman Arvind Panagariya argues that acceleration in India‚Äôs GDP growth occurred during India‚Äôs fifth five year plan period (1974-79), while underlining the fact that growth revival during the late 1970s and early 1980s was more volatile in nature than the post-reform period.

At a time when India is the fastest-growing economy in the world, it is to be expected that the incumbent regimes would claim credit for the economic performance and dismiss the socialist rhetoric of the past of which Gandhi is an important icon.

However, it also remains a fact that despite faster growth, India stills lags behind most peers in human development outcomes.

The economic boom in southeast Asia and China helped these countries to significantly improve their human development indicators. Today, these countries are significantly ahead of India in terms of health and education levels. In fact, this gap started widening during the period when Gandhi was in power (see chart above). It remains to be seen whether a shift from Congress‚Äôs Garibi Hatao to Modi‚Äôs Cash Hatao will break this jinx.

Policy/Economy,The journey of India‚Äôs GDP from 1000 A.D. to 2020,49,4zc42a,http://qz.com/764352/the-journey-of-indias-gdp-from-1000-a-d-to-2020/,30,,User_Name13," In the year 1700 accounted 24.4% of global GDP. 

By 1950 we were down to 4.2% of global GDP.

And we bottomed out in 1979 with 3% of global GDP.

My beef with this article is that it doesn't even mention Manmohan Singh and completely glosses over the monumental 1991 economic liberisation reforms. Singh set the stage for someone like Modi to become PM and continue the work increasing India's share of global GDP. 

Singh had to do battle with the License Raj, before Singh did away with the old License Raj system, it was almost impossible for even an upper-middle class Indian to become a successful entrepreneur. 

My point is without Singh, you don't get a Modi.  The article is peddling the myth that Indian decline began under the British. This is a lie. India's decline *continued* under the British. India would not have been taken over by the Brits if its decline had not started earlier, thereby making it weak, thus making it easier to conquer.

Indian GDP per capita was already declining by the time the British came. [Look at the change from 1600 to 1700](http://tinyurl.com/gurlh3p).

Other than this annoying habit, the article mostly says what is obvious, India will return to its rightful place in the coming decades at the forefront of economic might. Till about 300 years¬†ago, India accounted for more than a quarter of the world's GDP. This share began falling following the advent of British power over the subcontinent.

So I've always assumed India's been on a decline since 1000 AD but now steadily growing. Would I be right in assuming that?  This is misleading. 

Just look at the population share of Asia (which is basically China + India) in this chart - http://i.imgur.com/ZqJhbeg.png

Until the 18th century, it has consistently been 65 to 70% of the world share.

Look at this chart which shows the GDP share of each region - http://cdn.theatlantic.com/static/mt/assets/business/Screen%20Shot%202012-06-20%20at%209.37.55%20AM.png and sum the India + China shares of GDP.

Until the 18th century, it has consistently been 65 to 70% of the world share.

It was only until the 1700s onwards when industrialization and colonialism started taking off that the GDP shares started diverging from the world share.

To summarize - we were never an economic superpower in the agrarian world which existed from 1000s to 1700s. In fact, it is highly unlikely we that we ever had the same position that USA does now in modern history.

it will not end happily, i assure you.  The article did not mention the role of Govt. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW5FRuMkQ6g That's the classical liberal or libertarian point of view, espoused by the Chicago School of Economics. That would be minarchism, neo-liberalism isn't necessarily the Austrian school.  This isn't really a question for economists but more for political scientists, but that's just semantics. 

Neo-liberal refers to the 'original' liberalism, that is the liberalism that developed during the 17th-18th century that advocated for government to have limited power and to vest greater power in the individual. Theoretically this means the government serves as minimal a role as possible- upholding laws through courts and police forces, providing national defence, etc.

The issue is that 'law and order' as 'justice' are broad terms that aren't clearly defined. For instance, you can and people have argued that banning alcohol is a government move to uphold law and order, as less drunkards will cause trouble or beat their wives or commit assault. You can argue that reservation policies are a policy to uphold justice, to correct the injustice of generations of caste discrimination and such. 

Naturally neo-liberalism vests a lot of power and freedom in the private sector. That said, anti-trust and pro-competition regulations are another key role for the government to play.  When Jhootly and call drop mantri fails to auction spectrum to its potential and loot the exchequer. /s Govt Role - Providing basic services like public transport,good roads, water and electricity (which can be contracted to private players) and govt. schools and maybe govt. universities

Federal Govt. - National Security, Defence and Foreign Policy and helping states in facilitating economic growth and fund central universities, access to afordable healthcare (doesn't mean running govt. hospitals) and enforce contracts and regulate.

State Govt. - Law and order, ensuring the above services are delivered, fund state universities and ensure facilitation of economic growth by removing roadblocks for businesses, slash redtape, repeal redundant state laws and enforce the laws.

All other economic activity like running companies must be done by private players. That's the conservative way of thinking, not liberal.",2016-11-07 23:19:50

**Moving towards an investment revival** 

 ______ 
Is corporate investment finally stirring to life? There are now a few silver
linings in what continues to be a dark sky. These rays of hope deserve more
attention than they are getting right now.

In its latest monetary policy statement released in early February, the
monetary policy committee of the Indian central bank said, as part of its
comments on the outlook for the Indian economy, that there are early signs of
‚Äúa revival in investment activity‚Äù. The panel that sets interest rates
believes the revival in global demand should help strengthen domestic
investment. Earlier, the World Bank had said in its June update on the global
economy that gross domestic capital formation‚Äîor investment‚Äîwould overtake
private consumer spending in fiscal year 2019 as the main driver of Indian
economic growth. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has also been expecting
a private sector investment recovery in the next fiscal year.

Much of this seems to fly in the face of an overwhelming fact: Indian industry
is still struggling with the problem of overcapacity. The production
facilities frenetically built during the previous economic boom have run into
the problem of weak domestic demand. However, the first synchronized recovery
in the global economy since the financial crisis could provide the export
demand needed for Indian companies struggling with excess capacity.

The industrial outlook surveys conducted every quarter by the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) continue to show capacity utilization at a little over 70%. This
number needs to increase by at least 10 percentage points before companies get
back into investment mode. It is also widely known that the twin balance sheet
problem, or the mirror images of excess corporate leverage and a mountain of
soured bank loans, is a huge obstacle for private investment. Companies are
more focused on using cash flows from operations as well as asset sales to
reduce debt rather than invest in new capacity.

However, the global data is more reassuring. Many large economies have seen a
strong revival in corporate investment over the past few months, and it would
be unusual if Indian corporate investment did not pick up, though a lot
depends on what happens to the structural overcapacity in China as a result of
its investment bubble. The big policy gamble taken by the Donald Trump
administration in the US‚Äîof a large fiscal stimulus despite tight labour
markets‚Äîcould blow another global bubble unless monetary policy is tightened
rapidly. But for now it will fuel strong global demand.

Much of the early data in India suggests that the game right now is capacity
expansion rather than building new facilities. The Mark To Market column
published in this newspaper cited the order trends in capital goods companies
such as ABB India, Siemens and Thermax to argue that brownfield investments
are seeing a recovery. There is less action as far as greenfield investments
go. The index of industrial production also suggests that capital goods
production is growing at a healthy clip, though it must be reiterated that
this segment of the factory output data is notoriously volatile.

There is widespread agreement that India cannot have sustainable growth
acceleration unless private sector investment picks up. The economy has till
recently been very heavily dependent on consumer spending plus public
investment by the government. The two other drivers of aggregate
demand‚Äîcorporate investment and exports‚Äîhave struggled. It is for this reason
that the recent green shoots are important.

A bit of recent economic history would help clarify why a recovery in private
sector investment matters for India. The two important economic booms in the
26 years since the 1991 economic reforms tell us an important story. Be it the
1994-97 acceleration or the one between 2004-08, it is clear that a
combination of a strong global economy plus a private sector investment boom
is needed to lift the underlying trend economic growth on a sustainable basis.
Consumer spending and government expenditure alone can take economic growth so
far‚Äîbut no further.

Strong export growth to complement the recovery in domestic demand could help
companies deal with excess capacity. The deleveraging of corporate balance
sheets as well as the recapitalization of public sector banks can create space
for the financing of new industrial capacity. The battle against the
investment slump is far from over‚Äîbut there is now reason to hope that the
worst is over.

Policy/Economy,[Ask] Why central and state governments are failing in job creation?,15,57kl2h,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/57kl2h/ask_why_central_and_state_governments_are_failing/,17,Is it possible for governments to set up new companies to improve job creation? Or do we have to amend old labour laws? What about land acquisition issues? Do we need a new land acquisition law? Is grabbing a land from citizens and giving them some peanuts is acceptable? ,Raghavcm," How about crony socialists not call bharat bands when labour laws are to be amended? Govrnments don't create jobs. That happens only in Marxists countries. 

Otherwise government is enabler not provider. in an open economy as India is vying for government role is not active participation. 

They need to create laws and be ahead of the curve. For example: That fucking fucktard of fuck shit land acquistion bill has been pending since the first time I read the century old law ! Like since 10 yrs chutiyas are still debating and with every revision you are eroding the rights of the original dwellers of the land. Development can not happen at the cost of a community .. .cause when that happens, the capitalist gets the profits and the welfare costs of takign care of the community falls on government, which increases overall expenditure of the state. 

So we need our governments to do these and not work on creating jobs.

**India officials trek through villages to map rising joblessness** 

 ______ 
New Delhi: As India‚Äôs infamous summer heat started to rise this April, hundreds of researchers began a trek through villages and cities seeking answers to one of the country‚Äôs enduring policy puzzles ‚Äî jobs. The answer could shape Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs re-election bid in 2019.

The South Asian nation‚Äôs most ambitious jobs survey to date will reveal annual employment numbers for the whole country and quarterly estimates for its growing cities. That‚Äôs a significant change from the current system where the latest numbers are at least one-year old.

More From Livemint ¬ª

‚ÄúThis data will bridge a huge gap,‚Äù said Pronab Sen, country director at the New Delhi-based International Growth Centre and India‚Äôs former chief statistician. ‚ÄúThis survey will give us an idea of the size of the GDP of India‚Äôs informal sector ‚Äî there‚Äôs no other major economy with such high levels of informality,‚Äù he said. More than 90% of workers exist in the grey economy ‚Äî unaccounted for in any official statistics ‚Äî which complicates efforts to track unemployment.

India has so far lacked a reliable policy tool in the form of real-time employment numbers to help policy makers and its central bank. Labour is governed by both federal and state governments and data collection is scattered, with seven federal agencies publishing reports, according to the Statistics Ministry.

Poll promises

Before sweeping to power in the biggest election win in 30 years, Modi appealed to young job-seekers ‚Äî more than half of the population ‚Äî with a promise to create 10 million jobs. Three years later it remains unclear how many positions have been created. While his critics say Modi‚Äôs biggest failure so far has been his inability to increase formal employment, officials in his government say the claims of jobless growth are a ‚Äúbit bogus.‚Äù

Bloomberg

Failure could risk voter backlash over jobs ‚Äî an issue already driving protests in some parts of the country ‚Äî and lead to even more divisive campaigning in the lead up to the country‚Äôs national elections.

‚ÄúThe nation will come to know whether prime minister Modi has been able to fulfill his electoral promise of creating jobs,‚Äù said Satish Misra, an analyst at the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation. ‚ÄúIt will be an answer to India‚Äôs unemployment puzzle.‚Äù

Jagdish Thakkar, a spokesman in the Prime Minister‚Äôs Office, didn‚Äôt return calls seeking comment.

Disappearing employment

While India is one of the world‚Äôs fastest-growing economies, employment creation in eight sectors, including textiles and automobiles, was the slowest in seven years, according to a 2016 Ministry of Labour report. More than 12 million Indians enter the workforce every year, government data show. Between 2011 to 2015, the number of agricultural jobs reduced by 26 million while non-farm ones rose 33 million, according to McKinsey Global Institute.

Bloomberg

The government has trained more than 700 researchers to feed data directly on to tablets instead of the usual paper questionnaires, according to Rakesh Kumar, additional director general of the National Sample Survey Office.

More than 100,000 sample households across 7,500 villages and 5,000 urban blocks will be questioned every quarter to generate closer-to-real-time information, creating seven quarters worth of credible and comparable quarterly and annual labour data for the first time, Kumar said. The first tranche of data is expected to be revealed in December next year.

Data delinquency

The survey may also be the first set of comparable economic data from India since 2015 when Modi‚Äôs government initiated changes to how the nation plots economic indicators like inflation and gross domestic product. Policy makers and economists have puzzled over new GDP and inflation calculations that catapulted India to become the world‚Äôs fastest-growing major economy.

The picture was muddled further in November last year after the prime minister overnight cancelled 86% of currency in circulation.

With its landmark goods and services tax launched on 1 July, calculations used to compile GDP and inflation data are also expected to be out of sync for at least a few months.

Yet, in a country where fewer than 5% of people declare their incomes and 1% pay income tax, the GST will help improve GDP calculations by making available high quality, granular data, according to Neelkanth Mishra, managing director and India equity strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG.

Timely release

India‚Äôs decision to use Soviet-style five-year plans to plot its economy is another reason for the country‚Äôs data delinquency, Mishra said in a phone interview from Mumbai. Modi replaced those plans with a three-year strategy released earlier this year by the government‚Äôs planning body NITI Aayog, which discusses ‚Äúhigh-productivity, high-wage jobs‚Äù.

Yet, there‚Äôs some apprehension about whether the government will keep to its timetable to release the labour survey. The task force formed last month under NITI Aayog‚Äôs vice chairman Arvind Panagariya recommended an employment survey every three years.

‚ÄúIt seems the data may not go in his government‚Äôs favour as there is not much evidence of job creation because of slow down of economy and demonetisation,‚Äù said ORF‚Äôs Misra about whether Modi will release the jobs survey findings next December. ‚ÄúIn that case he will not allow the data to be released few months before the election ‚Äî if he releases, it will be a bold step.‚Äù Bloomberg

Demonetisation and ramping up tensions w/Pakistan is not any less of a giant 2016 event than the others, it affects over a billion people more than either the Philipines drugs crackdown, Turkish coup or ""the Donald""s shenanigans. In the grand scheme of things, maybe India isn't fucking up that much? Or do you think that the international media and it's consensus-making machine is satisfied with the way affairs are headed? ",tejmuk," What has he done to make the entire world to laugh at him? He enforced a very isolating policy. 

On the other hand Duterte called Obama ""son of  a whore"" twice, and Trump, well he's said ""global warming is a Chinese hoax"" to be laughing stock of the world. Because Modi has been doing well in foreign policy. His fuck-ups are primarily domestic. Also, botching demonetisation cannot be compared to the bloodletting in the Philippines. 

Trump also gets enormous amount of attention because the US is the only superpower in the world. Aside from that, he has a habit of overtweeting about foreign policy. He just sent US/China relations into a tizzy because of his stance on Taiwan over a few tweets.

Modi is not more competent than they are, but India still has a lower profile than either. The Philippines isn't as important than India, but the reason why Duterte gets attention is the China connection. Moving away from the US to China gets attention in the Western press, so they try to discredit him. It's a way of warning others.

Also, up until now, Modi had an aura of competence. If he keeps these fuckups going for a few more years, you'll see opinion turning. I'm already seeing NRIs writing self-serving articles how ""Modi is not like Trump at all"". Well, no, but the differences are not amazing either. Modi is, if anything, even more xenophobic than Trump. He constantly invokes foreigners as a weapon to bash others(as recently seen re: Pakistan against demonetisation critics, his dark insinuations about Sonia Gandhi and her foreign roots etc, his rants against Bangladeshi illegal immigrants during the 2014 election and so on. All Trumpian and then some) I still don't understand how he would've gotten that much respect in the first place, considering his dubious past. I would say he's close to Erdogan in that they're both right wing, but Modi is currently _passively_ right wing while Erdogan is _actively_ so, in a lot of ways. Duerte is a raving lunatic, so I don't think we've descended to that level. At least he never really publically admitted to have killed a person in cold blood. Trump, is vastly different from all the other four. He has no politics - he sways with the wind (read money). He is a joke, and I say that even after he got elected. All others are career politicians, who have long backgrounds in politics. But yes, I do think that overseeing such a disastrously executed policy must've gained him some disrepute.  Erdogan is a political laughing stock? What is the definition of laughing stock? Even people who laugh at Trump fear about him.

Who is laughing at Dueterret? From when killing people in name of justice become laughing stock?

 I think he has been at least linked to them because the three have similar campaigning styles (uber-nationalist, savvy use of social media to drown out dissent, hyper-insensitive towards minorities, etc)

[Here's an article which ran in US in run-up to Trump's election pointing out the similarities](http://www.cnn.com/2016/09/15/opinions/india-election-lessons-richard/). Our policies doesn't dictate the world economics. Call it whatever you may, but people in the West don't care about anything about India on a day to day basis.

**India‚Äôs imminent economic crisis**

To foster higher growth, authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector to invest in India. Photo: Mint

Poor macroeconomic management, both by the central bank and political regimes over the past several years, is leading India toward an imminent vicious cycle of low growth and high inflation, making it exceedingly vulnerable to emerging domestic and geopolitical risks. The low growth-high inflation scenario will lead to higher fiscal and current account deficits, consequent capital outflows, a weaker currency and a lack of confidence in the economy among investors. The authorities need to undertake meaningful structural reforms and loosen monetary and exchange rate policy at the earliest to arrest the decline before it culminates in an external and financial crisis. A loose fiscal policy (increased government expenditure) at this juncture with a likely low fiscal multiplier would be counterproductive and accelerate the pace of economic decline.

Economic growth in India has likely been lower than the 7% rate that has been estimated by the Central Statistical Authority for the past two-three years. A sustained 7% gross domestic product (GDP) growth has been inconsistent with other major indicators, including credit, investment, index of industrial production, and exports growth slowing for at least the past four years. A slower 5.7% official GDP growth in 2QFY18 is therefore not surprising. In fact, before the switch to a new series of GDP numbers in early 2015, GDP growth estimates were 4.7% for FY14, according to the old series. New methodology introduced in the new series raised them to 6.7% for FY14, inconsistent with other indicators. Amongst other flaws, value added in manufacturing, which has been consistently significantly higher than other indicators would suggest, is arrived at from a corporate financial database maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs. It would be impossible to arrive at a true measure of value added in manufacturing from financial accounting data for even a few large firms such as Reliance, especially in an era where production of goods and services is becoming increasingly integrated.

Economic output and growth depend mainly on productivity growth and on increases in labour and capital; most commentators mistakenly tend to focus instead on the uses of this output‚Äîconsumption, investment and exports. Productivity growth, the main driver of growth, depends on structural reforms that would require better institutions and improving human skills.

Structural reforms are reforms aimed at changing the structure of the economy to make it more market-oriented, and consequently efficient and productive. India needs to focus on reforms in several areas‚Äîliberalizing markets, legal, civil service, tax structure, financial sector, education, and labour, amongst others. In competitive markets, any price different from the market-determined one (e.g. controls such as minimum or maximum prices) leads to a decline in output, ensuring reduced GDP.

To foster higher economic growth and job creation, the authorities need to focus on productivity enhancing structural reforms that would encourage the private sector‚Äîdomestic and foreign‚Äîto invest in India. Specifically, the innumerable controls on markets and administered prices need to be freed up, including food and agricultural prices, water, electricity, pharmaceuticals, fertilizers, seeds and railways, amongst others that reduce output and lead to a misallocation of resources. The direct tax structure needs to be simple and transparent with retrospective taxes eliminated. Public sector banks need to be recapitalized and privatized. The education system needs to be opened up to investors‚Äîdomestic and foreign‚Äîas a profit-making sector, both at the school and higher education levels. These are minimal measures to attract investments.

The inexplicably tight monetary policy of high interest rates and overvalued exchange rate have been damaging to the economy. The insistence of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to engage in foreign exchange market intervention to maintain an overvalued currency has encouraged further volatile debt inflows. This has increased India‚Äôs external vulnerability and inhibited financial markets development.

Overall, RBI‚Äôs high interest rate and overvalued exchange rate policy has hurt credit growth, especially to industry, hurt firm-level debt sustainability and in turn bank balance sheets, and damaged exports and domestic industry further via cheaper imports. India is the only major economy in Asia with a negative credit gap (deviation from trend), according to the International Monetary Fund.

Fiscal policy has largely been unimaginative and a tighter fiscal policy with tight monetary policy has meant no policy support for growth over the past several years. Tax policy has mainly been one of raising tax rates‚Äîexcise duties on petrol and diesel mainly and service tax rates that have increased from 12% to 18% over the last three years. At the same time, little effort has been made to simplify tax rules; indeed, the new goods and services tax structure with multiple rates is the most complicated globally. This structure with a smattering of controls has kept money out of India.

The fiscal multiplier is low; around 0.3 for emerging economies, according to some estimates. This means an increased fiscal expenditure of Rs40,000 crore (0.3% of GDP) being mentioned in the press would yield a negligible additional growth of 0.1% to GDP, raising growth from 5.7% to 5.8%.

The costs of this misguided fiscal expansion (government expenditure) could be significantly high. It would not lead to sustainable growth or increased investments from the private sector. The larger fiscal deficit, along with slowing growth reducing tax revenue, and a consequent worsening fiscal situation would lead to more borrowing from the RBI. At the same time, the deteriorating economic situation would lead to capital outflows, slowing the economy further, draining liquidity from the system and raising interest rates, further dampening economic growth.

To conclude, the government needs to undertake structural reforms on a war-footing to encourage investments to grow the economy and increase revenue growth. Interest rates need to be reduced by the RBI. Misadventures such as expansionary fiscal policy will not be sustainable and will lead to low growth, higher fiscal deficit, high inflation, less competitiveness that would trigger capital outflows and lead to an external and also a financial crisis if financial sector weaknesses are not addressed.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis** 

 ______

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government‚Äôs actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy‚Äîsomething long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country‚Äôs economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions‚Äîsome of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming‚Äîespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential‚Äîwhich some argue is around 8-8.5%‚Äîas the government‚Äôs spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over‚Äîindeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government‚Äôs anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework‚Äîexactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

‚ÄúThe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI‚Äôs initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,‚Äù and then added, ‚ÄúWe believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks‚Äô balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.‚Äù

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

**Calls to weaken rupee are misguided** 

 ______ 
Rather like Goldilocks, commentators on the Indian rupee don‚Äôt like the value of the currency too low or too high‚Äîthey would like it just right. Thus, when the rupee is weak, there are complaints that it is too weak; with a strong rupee, there are complaints that it is too strong. It is understandable that industry shills should press for a weakening of the rupee. But it is not just those with a vested interest in promoting domestic industry who are crying foul‚Äî eminent economists have now joined the fray. In this newspaper, former chief economic adviser Deepak Nayyar and economist Ajit Ranade have batted for a weaker rupee in the past few weeks. Nayyar, in particular, is explicit that this is best achieved through lowering the policy interest rate, which, it is alleged, is too high.

Unfortunately, such arguments suffer from the fallacy of thinking that the tail wags the dog. It is not that the rupee is too strong relative to the US dollar, but rather that the US dollar is weak‚Äîrelative to a wide range of currencies, not just the rupee.

The figure shows a broad trade-weighted US dollar index from July 2016 to the present, and this clearly reveals that after a period of steady appreciation culminating approximately at the time that Donald Trump was inaugurated US president, the dollar has been steadily depreciating.

The rupee‚Äôs initial weakening followed by strengthening is a mirror image of this. Indeed, the dollar shows broadly similar behaviour vis-a-vis a range of advanced and emerging economy currencies. The fundamental driver is perhaps the market‚Äôs sense that Trump‚Äôs economic programme‚Äîtax cuts and infrastructure spending‚Äîis floundering. It is noteworthy that even with monetary tightening, the dollar has been weakening.

The real story is thus of dollar weakness, not rupee strength, and this turns the analysis on its head. For there is little if anything that Indian monetary authorities can‚Äîor should‚Äîdo in the face of a fluctuating dollar, beyond attempting to smooth excess volatility. As it happens, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) does intervene in currency markets, exactly for this reason, not to alter the underlying market-determined path of the exchange rate.

There is a second key proposition that critics miss. In a world of open capital markets, and in which the central bank wishes to pursue an independent monetary policy‚Äîin the case of India and many others, that choice is inflation targeting‚Äîwe must, perforce, accept that the nominal exchange rate will be largely market-determined. In other words, you cannot simultaneously pursue an independent monetary policy and control the exchange rate‚Äîa fundamental insight that we owe to the Nobel economist Robert Mundell and to which many critics seem strangely oblivious.

Unless critics would like India to abandon our inflation-targeting monetary policy regime and substitute it with a fundamentally different system, such as fixing the exchange rate to the US dollar or something else equally radical, they cannot simultaneously grumble about the interest rate and the exchange rate in an open economy.

It is perfectly possible to debate whether the global economy is in need of systemic monetary reform, but that is very different from suggesting that India, acting alone, should abandon inflation targeting in favour of a more exotic policy approach. And, if we accept inflation targeting, or indeed any conventional flexible exchange-rate monetary policy regime, we must accept that the value of the rupee will be basically market-determined, full stop.

The truth is this: Those at present batting for a lower policy rate and/or a weaker rupee are, it would appear, concerned primarily with the interests of domestic Indian industry, not Indian consumers‚Äî who stand to benefit from a stronger rupee to the extent that, for instance, they purchase foreign goods or travel abroad‚Äî or indeed the economy as a whole.

Let us not forget that an artificially weakened currency can make up, at least for a while, for a multitude of sins, such as low productivity in domestic industry, and that is another reason why industry pushes for it. Why become more competitive and more efficient when, hey presto, your friendly neighbourhood central banker can bid down the value of the currency and let you stand on stilts for a while? This is an old trick. For instance, Canada for years cushioned low domestic productivity with a depreciated currency.

The RBI‚Äôs monetary policy committee is correctly focused on achieving the inflation-target mandate, and ought not to get distracted by the red herring that a strong rupee is hurting the economy.

New Delhi: India could face significant short-term economic costs from the ban on large-denomination currency notes, with no significant long-term benefits, economist Paul Krugman warned on Friday.

The 2008 Nobel Prize-winning economist said there is a good case to be made for not having high-value currency notes, but noted that India‚Äôs ‚Äúunusual move‚Äù of discontinuing old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes was only a one-time effort to flush out hoarded money, and not to eliminate the denominations forever.

‚ÄúI understand the motivation, but it is a highly disruptive way to do it. I hardly see significant long-run gains, but there certainly are significant, although temporary, costs,‚Äù Krugman, a professor at The Graduate Center, City University of New York, said at the Hindustan Times Leadership summit.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on 8 November scrapped the high-denomination currency notes in a crackdown on unaccounted wealth, tax evasion, terror finance and counterfeit currency. The move took out 86% of the value of currency in circulation, and economists have warned that it would dent consumer demand in the short term, set back gains to agriculture from a bountiful monsoon and harm productivity.

One of the reasons for Krugman‚Äôs disapproval of demonetisation as part of a drive to tackle income tax evasion is his belief that it is practically difficult for developing economies with large unorganized sectors to raise the share of taxes as a proportion of GDP by relying too much on income taxes.

Although considered regressive, indirect taxes, such as the central excise duty and service tax levied by the central government in India and value added tax (VAT) by states, are more practical tools to raise tax revenue, he said. Indirect taxes are generally considered regressive as they affect the rich and the poor alike, unlike income tax, the burden of which increases progressively on tax payers with high income levels.

India is now leading the discussions among G20 nations for a multilateral framework to prevent income tax evasion, especially corporate tax, based on principles laid down by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of developed economies.

‚ÄúTrying to have an OECD style income tax system in a country which has a per capita GDP far below OECD levels is not doable,‚Äù Krugman said.

The American economist said India could be hit by a recession in China stemming from declining investment, but has no reason to worry about the US turning more protectionist under Donald Trump.

Krugman said it would be difficult for China to sustain investments as a share of GDP and a readjustment can spell trouble for other economies including India.

‚ÄúChina cannot continue its previous investment-driven growth model. How can you manage the large scale of adjustment without a massive recession?. China looks to me ready to blow up,‚Äù said Krugman.

He doesn‚Äôt see much of an impact on India from the US possibly taking steps to protect its jobs, including from the services sector in India.

‚ÄúI do not see a short-run macroeconomic crisis (in the US). If anything, policy will shift to fiscal expansion. Extremely unwise long-run policy does not necessarily carry a short-run cost. Economics is not a morality play. You can have bad policies turning out to be catastrophic a generation from now, but that does not necessarily bring a recession now. The US is not going to be a drag on the world economy, but If China blows up, it is going to be a drag on the world economy,‚Äù said Krugman.

He added that not being a trade surplus country will work to India‚Äôs advantage in this context. The comment comes in the backdrop of US president elect Donald J Trump‚Äôs economic policies widely being taken to be protectionist and hence likely to rattle a still recovering global economy.

Krugman said unlike China or Brazil, India will not be at the receiving end of any protectionist measure by the US.

Krugman attributes the current weak global economic growth to a chronic weakness in demand, which was not the outcome of the asset bubble and financial crisis of 2008, but something which ran deeper.

‚ÄúThere is a an underlying inadequacy in spending, which was masked by the asset bubble. The preponderance of evidence now is that this is the new normal that we need to live in a world which does not want to spend enough to keep itself fully employed,‚Äù Krugman said. ‚ÄúUnlike earlier thought, high level of public debt due to the economic stimulus that nations doled out in the last few years, now looks misplaced as interest rates are low.‚Äù

Krugman also called for a big burst of fiscal expansion in the world economy after which one could think of resetting policies.

**Overseas investors bullish on India dollar debt even as economy slows; here‚Äôs why** 

 ______ 
For all the weak spots in India‚Äôs economy, investor love for the nation‚Äôs offshore bonds endures.Companies have sold $10.6 billion of dollar debt so far in 2017, the most in three years, as one of the highest returns in Asia and prospects of a sovereign-rating upgrade prompt buyers to ignore data showing gross domestic product in the June quarter expanded at the slowest pace since 2014.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not only large institutional demand but also high retail appetite,‚Äù A.S. Thiyaga Rajan, a senior managing director at Aquarius Investment Advisors in Singapore, said by phone. ‚ÄúSome top Indian names are coming up‚Äù with dollar debt offerings, he said.The optimism around Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs economic policies and prospects of outsized profits are proving hard to resist for bond bulls. Dollar-denominated debt from India has returned 5.68 percent this year, compared with 4.95 percent in China and 2.98 percent in South Korea, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. indexes.There‚Äôs more juice left in the rally, according to Anthony Leung, a senior analyst at Wells Fargo & Co.‚ÄòGood Value‚ÄôIndia‚Äôs investment-grade company bonds ‚Äúremains a pocket of good value‚Äù across Asia and the steps taken by Modi‚Äôs government are ‚Äústeering the economy in the right direction,‚Äù he wrote in a Sept. 7 note. While challenges remain in cleaning up bad loans at banks, the start of an unified sales tax, abolition of subsidies and low oil prices will help offset the problems, he said.The policy measures are bearing fruit and will lead to the nation‚Äôs credit rating being raised by Moody‚Äôs Investors Service ‚Äúwithin a year,‚Äù Leung said. A Moody‚Äôs spokesperson said the firm does not comment on third-party speculation on ratings.Rating firms have India just above ‚Äújunk‚Äù status and while Modi‚Äôs government has pushed for an upgrade in the past few years, Moody‚Äôs, Standard & Poor‚Äôs and Fitch Ratings have all pushed back, citing high debt levels.Green BondsThat said, the unexpected slowdown in growth hasn‚Äôt put investors off India‚Äôs corporate debt or slowed new issuance. Buyers have drawn confidence from the fact that the nation is still one of the fastest-growing major economies in the world and a strong political mandate gives Modi more policy flexibility to revive expansion.Power Finance Corp., a state-run lender to utilities, has sought bids from credit rating firms for its $1 billion medium-term notes. Bharat Petroleum Corp. plans to raise $500 million via Singapore-listed bonds, Director of Finance K. Sivakumar said Tuesday. State Bank of India plans to raise up to $3 billion in the nation‚Äôs biggest overseas green-bond issue, the Economic Times reported last week, citing an unnamed executive close to the initiative.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more demand than supply for Indian bonds as investors bet on the outlook of the Modi-led economy,‚Äù said Bryan Wang, a fund manager at Fuh-Hwa Investment Trust Co. in Taipei.

Policy/Economy,A credibility deficit in statistics - Livemint,27,6f3mav,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/n4XqXbjX1lA7opVPgZgf1N/A-credibility-deficit-in-statistics.html,2,,iprashantsharma," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**A credibility deficit in statistics** 

 ______ 
The Central Statistics Office (CSO) released its estimate of gross domestic product (GDP) on 29 May. This is the first estimate for a full year after the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) took over. The growth rate of GDP at 7.3% at constant prices is not only better than the last year of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) but also makes India the fastest growing economy in the world. At a time when the world economy is showing signs of slowing, the performance of the Indian economy judged by these numbers should be cause for cheer. The fact that India‚Äôs economy grew faster than China‚Äôs may give the impression that all is well, despite fears of rural distress across India.

Unfortunately, nobody seems to be happy with these numbers. Not only has the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) raised the red flag doubting these numbers in its policy review, even the finance ministry has advised caution while interpreting these numbers. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has decided to send a team to understand the new GDP numbers put up by the CSO. Even the financial media, which should have lapped up these numbers, has shown maturity while reporting them.

India‚Äôs statistical agency is well-regarded not only in India but also internationally, but the new GDP numbers pose a serious challenge to its credibility. While the CSO did bring out an explanatory fact sheet, thus far, its attempts to explain these numbers have not worked‚Äîpartly because the explanations have been largely in terms of accounting and the arithmetic of national accounting, with very little clarity on the nature of changes and the sources of divergence between the new series and the old series.

It is not the arithmetic that is being questioned; the very basis of growth that seems to be at variance with the optimistic picture being presented by the national accounts. The high growth rate of GDP is attributed largely to the better-than-average performance of services and manufacturing with agriculture, mining and construction showing deceleration. The growth rate of manufacturing at 7.1% is not only at variance with the growth rate of Index of Industrial Production (IIP) at 2.3% but is also at variance with the reported sales of automobiles, tractors and many other manufactured goods, all of which show deceleration in sales and production. For the record, sales of commercial vehicles last year declined by 2.8%.

Even for the services sector, the growth rates appear far too optimistic. Profits of companies do not reflect this optimism; nor do sales figures, which are subdued compared with the numbers reported in the national accounts estimates. Other data, such as exports and investment data, are also at variance with the rosy picture presented by the CSO. Clearly, there is something missing as far as the GDP numbers are concerned. Quite simply, the whole is not the sum of parts as expected in an accounting sense.

One of the reasons offered by the CSO for the variance has been the change in methodology of arriving at these numbers. To keep up with international practices, the CSO changed the methodology of computing GDP and its aggregates. As a result, the manufacturing growth rate, which was earlier based on the IIP and the Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) data on volume and value-added growth, now also takes into account the advance tax filing data maintained by the ministry of corporate affairs (MCA). This practice of using tax data extends to the services sector as well, unlike the earlier series which used volume-based indices.

While the new series may be consistent with the best practices adopted internationally, doubts remain. These are not only related to the conceptual framework for measuring growth in sectors and sub-sectors of the economy but also to the coverage of the MCA database. This is particularly a problem of developing countries, where the informal/unorganized sector still constitutes a large part of the economy. Serious questions have also been raised by Prof. R. Nagaraj‚Äîa member of the committee which recommended the use of MCA data‚Äînot only on the completeness of the data but also the methodology adopted to blow up the estimates.

It is obvious that the new series raises far too many questions than it has answered so far. A reasonable approach to such drastic changes would have included a wider discussion among the academic community as well as media dissemination before the new series was adopted. By maintaining secrecy on these, the CSO has not only messed up its communication strategy but also done considerable damage to its credibility.

The matter is not only about statistical methods and estimates. The issue of national accounts is also fundamental to the understanding of what is happening to different sectors of the economy and the way different sectors respond to various policy measures. A discredited database not only does injustice to the statistical system of the country but also hinders policy response needed for long term growth by giving mixed signals.

Article was posted in 2015 when the questions surrounding the new GDP 2011-12 series had been released. 

The main criticisms were that Index of Industrial Production (IIP) growth data was at odds with manufacturing growth in the 2011-12 series. The new IIP 2011-12 series released seems to reconcile these numbers and hence an upward revision. 

Second, there has been no back series of GDP or GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) released based on 2011-12 prices. So essentially, we have estimates 2011-12 onwards and we have earlier estimates based on 2004-05 prices. We cannot directly compare these numbers as it's simply not a base shift, it is a shift in methodology. ",2017-06-04 10:57:32

Politics! Politics! 

RBI should keep the financial overstatements in check, and keep the government walking on a tight rope if it's to fulfil its goals.  Weather forecast has been more reliable lately.  Can we come to a conclusion already? Watch.

In 6 years, once things improve - people will bitch about this period and blame RR for holding hs back.

You never get credit for making things go - not wrong. I really respect this guy and modi for not fucking with him even though they have had their disagreements. The economy is in shambles and I'm happy that he's not sugarcoating this. Just a day in office for him, I believe. The best suited guy for the job too. 

I'm happy as long as there is a plan, god damn it.  We have moved a little from having a balanced inflation to having some upside risk inflation forecast for next year, says Rajan.

**Central bank liquidity withdrawal: Short-term uncertainty can be long-term opportunity** 

 ______ 
Recently, we have seen huge sell-off in the global bond market as nervousness deepened that central banks are moving toward reducing stimulus efforts that have supported debt markets Almost all the central banks be it the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, the Bank of England or the Bank of Canada, each one is preparing the markets for a gradual withdrawal from accommodative monetary policies.The global economy is experiencing synchronous growth, labor markets are improving and consumer spending and business investment have picked up. However inflation is running below central banks‚Äô targets. The recent data on inflation shows that there is a pickup in inflation but it still remains below desired levels in most developed economies.The minutes of the US Federal Open Market Committee‚Äôs June policy discussions shower a split over inflation. Minutes from the ECB released indicated that the ECB was worried about how best to communicate increasing confidence in the eurozone economy without roiling market. The news of shifting monetary policy trajectories of central banks have led to the volatility in both stock market and Forex market.The Bank of Japan and the European Central banks are scheduled to meet on July 20 and Fed interest rates decision is scheduled on July 26. Though Fed Chair Yellen has said that the US economy is healthy enough for the Fed to proceed with plans to raise rates and begin winding down its massive bond portfolio, but it is expected that Fed would slow the pace of rate hikes down the road and interest rates would remain historically low over the longer term.Emerging economies including India have undoubtedly been benefited from the environment of lower interest rates.Among all major economies, the interest rate regime in India only is on a downward trajectory.Meanwhile, recent data pointed to slowing industrial production growth and to a falling retail price inflation has given room to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to resort to accommodative stance from neutral at the review meeting on August 2.The markets know that the long period of low rates has to end sometime and a gradual normalisation of policy rates may not necessarily impact the stock markets. However, a sudden change in yield expectations may cause volatility in the market. As the fundamentals of the Indian economy are strong, any inorderly tapering by the major central bankers would have limited impact on the Indian stock market.So, it is advised to use any dip into the market as buying opportunity and remain invested for long term as India is a bright spot among its peer though its valuation looks rich.

Policy/Economy,[Politics] Is the golden age over for emerging markets?,18,64q0jq,http://www.livemint.com/Money/pcyXUJDZsh0G08fOB3XF7L/Is-the-golden-age-over-for-emerging-markets.html,2,,whiplash_14," ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article.

**Is the golden age over for emerging markets?** 

 ______ 
The answer to that question is probably yes, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). A chapter in its latest World Economic Outlook warns emerging economies they can no longer count on the benign external environment that had led to high economic growth in their economies in the last few decades.

It warns of ‚Äúfading external tailwinds, including waning potential growth in advanced economies, slowdown and rebalancing in China, and a shift in the commodity cycle that has affected commodity exporters‚Äù. It says that, ‚ÄúTogether with a risk of protectionism in advanced economies and tighter financial conditions as US monetary policy normalizes, these changes make for a more challenging external environment for emerging market and developing economies going forward.‚Äù

The chart paints a broad picture. It shows how the contribution of emerging markets to world growth increased from 18.2% during 1976-79 to 69.82% during 2010-15. The contribution of developing countries to world consumption rose even more markedly‚Äîfrom 13.9% during 1976-79 to 72% in 2010-15. But the rise of emerging markets is an old story. What‚Äôs new are the projections‚Äîthe IMF forecasts that the contribution of emerging economies to both global growth and consumption will decrease during the period 2016-2021, as the chart indicates. True, the decrease is not much, but it does mark a turning point from the hefty increases of earlier decades.

How important are external conditions for growth in emerging markets? The IMF article says a 1 percentage point increase in domestic absorption by a country‚Äôs trading partners translates into around a fifth of the annual average growth in GDP per capita in emerging markets. And secondly, a 1 percentage point increase in the ratio of capital flows to GDP of emerging market and developing economies raises medium-term growth by 0.2 percentage points.

Taken together with higher growth on account of better terms of trade for commodities, the IMF estimates that over the past two decades, these factors accounted for more than half of medium-term growth, on average, across emerging market and developing economies. In turn, about half of the contribution to growth from external factors is due to higher capital inflows to emerging markets.

Will India too be affected? Well, India is one of those countries where domestic demand has been the mainstay of growth. But we shouldn‚Äôt underestimate the important part that external demand has played in supplementing that growth. One very important element of India‚Äôs liberalisation story and of its growth pick-up after liberalisation is the increase in its share of exports of goods and services to GDP from 6.8% in 1990-91 to 25% in 2013-14. The most rapid spurt happened in the early noughties, during the period of the global boom, when the ratio went up from 12.6% in 2001-02 to 23.7% in 2008-09.

As the IMF report says, ‚Äúa favourable impulse from external demand and financial conditions helps medium-term growth outcomes by making growth accelerations more likely. It also reduces the likelihood of growth reversals.‚Äù

That‚Äôs not all. The rise in fund flows to the Indian stock markets during the noughties led to a boom in the secondary and primary equity markets, allowing companies to raise capital easily and lowering their cost of capital. This, in turn, sparked an investment boom and also led to higher employment, higher wages and consequently, to higher consumption. As the IMF says, ‚ÄúCapital inflows can enhance growth in emerging market and developing economies through various channels: augmentation of funds available for investment, transmission of crucial know-how and technological diffusion, and adoption of market discipline and better governance practices.‚Äù

Given the importance of the external sector, what then can be done to mitigate the impact of the headwinds mentioned above? The IMF believes that, faced with a potentially less supportive external environment than in the past, emerging market and developing economies can get the most out of a weaker growth impulse from external conditions by strengthening their institutional frameworks and adopting a policy mix that protects trade integration; permits exchange rate flexibility; and ensures that vulnerabilities stemming from high current account deficits and external debt, as well as high public debt, are contained.

These are all standard text-book remedies, but complying with them will be all the more important in a less benign external environment.

The markets, fixated perhaps on the short term, seem to be ignoring these long-run risks outlined by the IMF. As a recent Bank for International Settlements paper by Luis Awazu Pereira de Silva and Elod Takats says, ‚ÄúWe are witnessing a departure from the policies of trade integration and multilateral cooperation that have been our successful recipe for the last 50 years. Is it purely rhetorical or real? Temporary or lasting? Is it linked to the current backlash against globalisation? Therefore, there is a disconnect between market exuberance and policy uncertainty. There are indeed threats to trade, financial integration and international cooperation that benefited both AEs and EMEs. These threats are increasing.‚Äù

Policy/Economy,August inflation shrinks to 5-year low of 3.74%,32,2gggny,http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/august-inflation-eases-to-nearly-5-year-low-of-3-74/article1-1264104.aspx,52,,ssaxena," This is awesome! Hope they are able to sustain it and bring back some real growth.  I don't know why people downvoted the one comment which commended the RBIs role.
EDIT: And its wholesale index not the consumer price index inflation which has started getting used as the index now, its not as low. 

Yeah, Modiji take credit else these people are going to downvote the hell out of me. Fucking ambani conspiracy to take away key talking points from AAP before delhi elections. Sab mili bhagat hai. Maine logon se pooch liya hai, koi mehengai kam nahi hui... yada yada paid media, when will BJP government punish those who brought tomato prices to 100Rs. Their own MP's are hoarders etc etc.. whitenoise.

 I don't see any sarcastic ""acche din"" comments here. What's with the rIndian *jholawalas*? 4 months, or 122 days, and Modi has beaten back inflation to 2009 levels. Can't they conjure up some devastation or evil in this? In my view, this has little or nothing to do with Modis election to the center. The RBI has managed to keep interest rates high enough for a while now (without succumbing to pressures from the business side; thanks dr Rajan!). Lowered inflation is a natural outcome of current Indian monetary policy. I fail to see the fiscal policies that could have contributed to this. The latest budget does not contain any dramatic shifts in terms of spending or taxation, so I'd be surprised to attribute this outcome to the new government. 

If I'm wrong, I would love to hear why.  modi delivers !

Not fair guys, not fair.  Yeah. 'Achche din' are here.

**Opinion: Modi's Approach To China Has Done Us Proud** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government's decision to not send an envoy to China's big
Belt and Road Forum (abbreviated, incredibly, BARF) has been the cause of much
wailing and gnashing of teeth in New Delhi. Given the fact that India is
practically the only large economy to not be represented there - and that
dozens and dozens of countries have sent representatives, many the heads of
their governments - it has come across to some people as the Modi government
deliberately choosing to isolate India. It has been criticised thus as
stubborn opposition to an initiative that has seized the world's imagination.

Well, if Modi has isolated India on this issue, so be it. He and his foreign
policy establishment deserve praise for taking a bold stand of dissent on
grounds that are both principled and realist.

The government's thinking on this issue is unusually clear and well-
articulated. The Ministry of External Affairs released a statement that
""connectivity initiatives must follow principles of financial responsibility
to avoid projects that would create unsustainable debt burden for communities;
balanced ecological and environmental protection and preservation standards;
transparent assessment of project costs; and skill and technology transfer to
help long term running and maintenance of the assets created by local
communities."" It is worth noting that India's legitimate objections to the
path of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC - one of the sub-
initiatives of One Belt One Road or OBOR - also got a mention, but were
clearly rhetorically subordinate to the larger, principled objection about the
sustainability issues involved.

While India is the only large economy to not send a representative to BARF, it
is not as if it has received universal acclaim among those who have gone. The
Guardian reported that the European Union has abstained from some of the
resolutions the Chinese expected them to sign up to, citing environmental
reasons. Nor has the United States sent a senior official. So even the talk of
""isolation"" is not entirely true. Not every large country is willing to sign
up to Beijing's vision of a Middle Kingdom-centric global economy, but India
is the only major country willing to take a clear and visible stand on the
subject, and of that we can be proud.

Let's be clear: this does not mean that Indian companies may not take
advantage of OBOR connectivity, wherever it does get built. This is a free
country and a (relatively) free economy, and nobody will stop an Indian
manufacturer from using railway lines somewhere else in the world paid for by
China, if it helps their business. The private sector is not the government.
It is for the government, however, to take the long strategic view on what
OBOR connectivity will mean for the world, our neighbourhood, and our own
position in the global economy - and they have correctly decided that it will
not, on balance, be beneficial. Nor is this about distrusting China in
particular. India is more than willing to cooperate with China on
infrastructure finance - witness its decision to sign up to the AIIB and BRICS
Bank - and on the many issues being taken up in the BRICS and other forums.
This is, presumably, because it does not believe that those forums inherently
violate the principles that it believes OBOR, as currently structured, would
fail to uphold.

This is, frankly, the first time that I have felt that the Modi government has
taken a stand that the preceding government would have balked at doing. In
almost all cases, the Modi government foreign policy has been an extension of
Manmohan Singh's policies - which is entirely to its credit. Consistency in
such matters is the sign of a mature nation. But one of the errors that the
Singh government consistently made was to be extra-careful of Beijing's
sensitivities. It failed, in essence, to reap any reward for that attitude:
Beijing's foreign policy continued to be made with no thought of India's ""core
interests"". Consider, for example, climate change, where India signed up to
the Chinese agenda at the big conference of parties in Copenhagen during UPA-
II, only to find that Beijing went behind its back to sign a bilateral pact
with Washington on climate change a few years later. No doubt UPA-II would
also have learnt in time not to do so - but that does not take away any credit
from the Modi government for not being over-solicitous of Beijing's
sensitivities.

By taking the lead in questioning the basic rationale underlying OBOR, Modi
has done us proud. We should now ask, however: what next? A principled stand
on a conference is valuable in and of itself, but it needs to be followed up.

There are some obvious next moves. First, New Delhi must recognise that it is
essentially, by objecting to OBOR, standing up for liberal policies and
economics within various other countries. Thus India must now view itself as a
leader of a market-driven, liberal democratic bloc that wishes to create an
alternative view of the global economy to China's more authoritarian, state-
driven view. The latter is increasingly dominant, especially as Trump's
America turns its back on the world. We must stand up for market access, free
movement of capital goods and people, and liberal political principles
everywhere. This is both principled and in our real interests.

And second, we must work with the Japanese - our biggest partners in this
regard - to create connectivity belts that are not centred on China and which
serve our mutual strategic interests as well as not disrupting local countries
and economies the way OBOR might. Our cooperation with Japan - and Indonesia,
Singapore and Australia - must be taken to the next level.

Modi promised foreign policy leadership. For the first time, he is beginning
to deliver. He must keep going.

**Indian economy: From policy paralysis to investment paralysis** 

 ______

Last week Prime Minister Narendra Modi joined the ongoing rhetorical debate on the state of the Indian economy with a strong defence of his government‚Äôs actions over the last three years. Among other things, his intervention put the spotlight on the Indian economy‚Äîsomething long overdue, but not for the rhetorical charges that are being flung around on both sides.

If indeed there is a pithy way of summarizing the state of affairs suffice to say that the country‚Äôs economy has transitioned from a state of policy paralysis (which identified the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance or UPA) to one of investment paralysis.

Both are cause for worry but for entirely different reasons. One was the outcome of a government which, for whatever reasons, went into a policy funk with disastrous consequences.

The other is the result of structural disruptions‚Äîsome of which, like spiralling bad loans with banks, are a legacy of the UPA regime and a few induced by policy changes, like the rollout of the goods and services tax (GST) and demonetization of high value currencies, undertaken over the last three years.

So while one arose from inaction, the other is largely a fallout of not anticipating or reacting in time to address the disruptions arising from hitting the reset button on the economy.

It is important to grasp this distinction. Alternatively, there is a risk of being overwhelmed by the rhetorical claims and counterclaims on the economy; and missing the woods for the trees as it were.

As such the economy is not doing as badly as the opposition is claiming‚Äîespecially with almost every agency forecasting a rebound in economic growth, albeit marginal, in subsequent quarters. Most importantly, macroeconomic stability has been restored. On the other hand, it is certainly not performing to potential‚Äîwhich some argue is around 8-8.5%‚Äîas the government‚Äôs spin doctors are arguing.

This potential can be tapped only if the investment levels, which have dropped to worrisome lows, recover. But this is easier said than done. The legacy of bad debts or what Arvind Subramanian, chief economic adviser, describes as the twin balance sheet problem (because it affects the books of both companies and the banks who extended the loans) is not something that can be resolved overnight.

Alongside the disruptions caused by structural policy responses like GST are causing considerable pain. As the old business structures built over seven decades are replaced, rather abruptly in some cases, the new systems are not up and ready to take over‚Äîindeed, execution of ideas is where this government has erred. It is the fallout of this transition, which is lending hope to critics and a cause for worry to the government.

In a column published in Mint last week, Indira Rajaraman, alluded to this phenomenon very succinctly. According to her, GST has completely recast the existing risk-sharing mechanism, dealing a death blow to retail trade volumes. The solution, like Rajaraman argued, is not to backtrack on GST (as some political parties are suggesting), but instead to fix the anomaly through tweaks (one of which was accepted by the GST Council on Friday by putting in place quarterly filing of returns, instead of every month).

Similarly, the government‚Äôs anti-corruption initiatives are forcing a transition to a more transparent transactions framework‚Äîexactly why real estate, which thrived on unaccounted cash, is in such doldrums. Here too, the alternative framework has been slow to evolve and the government and other institutions like the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) are guilty of not pushing hard on walking the country through the required behavioural change.

The Economist Intelligence Unit in a note issued last week said as much.

‚ÄúThe deceleration in bank credit growth to industry is partly attributable to the RBI‚Äôs initiatives and the Bharatiya Janata Party‚Äôs efforts to reduce corruption at higher levels of business and government. However, the difficult business environment and slow-moving judicial system will make the transition to a more market-driven financial system extremely difficult,‚Äù and then added, ‚ÄúWe believe that a revival in private investment depends on the government injecting additional capital to banks‚Äô balance sheets, but also on companies readjusting their business models to the new financial system.‚Äù

In the final analysis, it can safely be said that the attention to the economy is welcome, but reducing it to a political blame game is not. And looking at a new and rapidly transforming India through a conventional lens is a bad idea.

The Union government, which has visibly begun its countdown to the 2019 general election as well as elections to key state assemblies like Gujarat, may be tempted to hit the panic button.

Even though politically expedient, it would be very myopic in terms of the long-term health of the Indian economy.

The analytical solution would help the income tax department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details.

New Delhi: To plug tax loopholes, the income tax (I-T) department will use Big Data analytics to track down evaders by collecting information such as common address, mobile number and e-mail to establish relationship between their multiple PANs. The department, with support from private firms, will analyse the voluminous data available post demonetisation for checking relationships between PAN holders.

The managed service provider (MSP), which the I-T department plans to hire, will design and operationalise analytical solution that will help collating data, matching it and identifying relationships as well as clustering of PAN and non-PAN data, an official said.

The analytical solution would help the department gather data received from banks, post offices and other sources for linking of information and identification of duplicate details. It will also identify records with errors or other defects for resubmission.

‚ÄúThe data quality errors and defects will be communicated to the reporting person or entities, say, banks or post offices for correction and improving data quality,‚Äù the official added.

The data integration and matching of the PAN based demonetisation information with that of I-T databases such as tax returns, TDS, third-party reporting, tax payments, would be used to build a comprehensive profile for the taxpayer. It will help identify link between PAN holders on the basis of relationships (business association, asset and transactional association) available in various databases, the official said, adding that the analytics will do clustering of PAN-linked demonetised data using identified relationships as well as common address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch.

Also, it will cluster non-PAN demonetised data using common name, address, mobile number, e-mail and bank branch. Taxpayer segmentation on the basis of taxpayers‚Äô status, type of ITR form used, nature of business, taxpayer segment, age of the individual and compliance history will also have to be prepared. It will prioritise demonetisation data based on taxpayer segment, relationships, clusters, rules and risk matrix.

‚ÄúDifferent types of interventions (send e-mail, SMS, outbound call, letter, notice, verification, investigation) can be selected for taxpayer priority and segment,‚Äù the official added.

There was a clear jump in our trend GDP growth rate after liberalization in 1992. 

 Why did India's economy falter?

---

> * For the past few decades, Indias economy has not grown as fast as it could, or as fast as Chinas.

> * However, Indias share of the global economy fell sharply during the 19th and 20th centuries, knocking it out of the top ten for a while (in raw GDP terms, the economy did grow but very slowly relative to industrialized countries).

> * However, modern economists and historians emphasize the fact that the British policy toward Indias economy was more nuanced and was more concerned with the British homelands trade policy than actually literally draining away wealth from India.

> * All in all, it can be concluded that Indias economy and place in global economic rankings is smaller than it should be at least partially because of British action, though the extent and intent of this action is a matter of debate.

We liberalized our economy 13 years after China did the same. This is the only reason.  A good article and the comments for the article is even more interesting. I think one of the big reasons is that the Chinese government has an almost totalitarian grip over the country.

What this means is, for example if they are making a bridge and they need permission from some people to raze their houses to make way, the government decides how much they will be compensated, when they have to vacate and if the homeowner goes against that, he is thrown in jail.

Thus a lot of daily hurdles that the Indian government has, the Chinese don't.

Looking so far back as the British is of no use. In 1960 India was doing better than China on all parameters. Technological dominance came later. Nauroji's argument holds because the British actually took wealth out of India, and used it to finance other ventures, including development of technology.

The government of India is in overdrive to promote digital payments in a country that is excessively dependent on cash with one of the highest cash to gross domestic product ratios in the world. Niti Aayog has proposed an award scheme to incentivize people to use digital modes of payments. Last week, the government announced several measures‚Äîsuch as discounts at petrol pumps and on rail tickets, and insurance policies sold by public sector insurance companies‚Äîto boost digital transactions.

There is indeed merit in reducing the usage of cash in the economy as electronic transactions, among other things, leave a trail and make tax avoidance more difficult. However, moving towards a more cashless society is a medium-to-long term goal. The government‚Äôs present urgency to turn the ongoing currency swap into a major push to make India a cashless economy must be seen keeping this in mind.

To be sure, the narrative of the currency exchange programme has changed significantly in the last one month. It was conceived and launched as an attack on black money and counterfeiting of currency notes, but the objective now seems to have shifted to making India a cashless economy. This newspaper supported the idea of the currency swap as part of a bouquet of policies against tax evaders. It was clear from the word go that this would only attack a part of the stock of black money that is stored in cash. But the incoming evidence suggests that many tax evaders have actually managed to launder their illicit wealth. A large number of new bank notes being recovered by the authorities in various parts of the country and a massive surge in deposits in Jan-Dhan accounts are cases in point. Clearly, the implementation of the currency exchange has left much to be desired. Effectiveness of policy also depends on implementation; ideas alone don‚Äôt lead to desired outcomes.

It now appears that the amount of currency notes that will not return to the banking system was overestimated. This perhaps explains the pivot to the cashless theme. As Praveen Chakravarty of IDFC Institute highlighted in these pages on Monday, Prime Minister Narender Modi mentioned ‚Äúblack money‚Äù 18 times in his initial speech on 8 November and did not talk about cashless or digital economy. However, in two speeches that he gave on 27 November, he mentioned ‚Äúcashless‚Äù and/or ‚Äúdigital‚Äù 24 times, but black money came in only nine times. The excessive amount of time being taken to replace the currency notes and persistent queues in front of banks and ATMs may also have prompted the government to push for digital transactions.

ALSO READ | Regulating the digital payment industry

However, the government would be well-advised to not depict the transition to a more cashless economy as the main objective behind the currency reform. The overwhelming public support that the government got after the withdrawal of high-value notes was for the attack on black money and not for making transactions cashless.

Reducing the role of cash in the system is a worthy goal, but it cannot be the driving force for this policy as it now appears to have become. As noted in this editorial, the move towards a more cashless system is a longer-term goal. There are practical problems on the way. A vast majority of Indians either don‚Äôt have bank accounts or the technological wherewithal to make or receive digital payments. Many of them belong to the same aspirational middle and neo-middle class that supported the move as an attack on black money and corruption.

Furthermore, digitization alone will not justify the political and economic risk attached to the currency swap. The latest high-frequency economic indicators such as auto sales and Purchasing Managers‚Äô Index for both services and manufacturing shows that economic activity has been affected, though the actual overall impact will only be known in the coming months. In terms of the political impact, the renewed friction between the government and the opposition has resulted in almost the entire winter session of Parliament being wasted, and it now appears that meeting the 1 April deadline for the implementation of the goods and services tax will be extremely difficult.

Since the government has taken a big political risk, it should avoid moving the goalposts. Changing the narrative of the currency swap could affect the government‚Äôs credibility and make it more difficult to take tough decisions. It will be a long-drawn-out battle against black money and action will be required on various fronts. Not all of it will be successful.

**Modi government: The next two years** 

 ______ 
The Narendra Modi government completed three years in office last week. Any assessment of its economic performance should take into account what it inherited. India faced a near-crisis situation in 2013. Inflation had spun out of control. Public finances were a mess. The rupee was in free fall. Confidence was low owing to corruption scandals and economic mismanagement by the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government in the years leading to the 2014 general election.

India has come a long way since then. The most important economic policy achievement of the past three years has been macroeconomic stability. Inflation is now under control. There has been a tentative recovery in economic growth. The balance of payments is comfortable. Part of this can be explained by the steep decline in global energy prices, but the retreat from loose monetary and fiscal policies has also been an important reason why the Indian economy is no longer fragile.

The reforms record has been a more mixed one‚Äîespecially since Modi spoke on the campaign trail about minimum government and maximum governance.

The Modi government should be satisfied that the stage is now set for the implementation of the goods and services tax (GST). Even the flawed GST we are beginning with will boost overall efficiency in the economy. India now has a new monetary policy framework. The passage of the bankruptcy code will lead to more efficient allocation of capital. However, these policy initiatives were inherited from the UPA regime. The Modi government needs to now craft its own reforms playbook for the next decade.

There have been some important initiatives. A new fiscal framework is in the works. High-level corruption has almost disappeared. The auction of natural resources has been done in a transparent manner. The government has also taken a number of steps to check the flow of black money. However, the most radical move made by the Modi government was the withdrawal of high-value banknotes in November 2016. The benefits of the move are not yet clear, and will only be known in the years ahead.

The government has managed to bring down the fiscal deficit while increasing capital expenditure. A recent report by Deutsche Bank showed that government expenditure led by capital expenditure increased in the last two years of the term of every government since 1991, with the exception of UPA-II, when expenditure went up in the last year. However, barring UPA-I, higher expenditure did not result in a corresponding increase in the fiscal deficit. It will be important for the Modi government to stick to the stated fiscal path, and not indulge in a spending spree like the UPA, as it could compromise the hard-won macroeconomic stability.

Along with maintaining fiscal discipline, the government will have to continue to work in areas that are holding back the economy. One of the reasons why growth has remained subdued in the last few years is the collapse in private sector investment. Policymakers have not been able to solve the twin balance sheet problem. A coherent strategy to clean up banks is still not in evidence. Privatization of public sector banks should be seriously considered.

Also, all efforts should be made to strengthen the corporate bond market in order to channelize long-term finance for Indian companies. This will also help boost activity in the infrastructure sector where private sector investment has been missing, partly because of the reluctance of banks to lend. An investment revival is critical for higher growth.

The government should now work on the next level of reforms. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee government managed to do a lot of things in the latter half of its tenure. For instance, the fiscal responsibility and budget management rules and pension reforms were implemented towards the end of its tenure. The looming political risk is that the job creation needed to maintain social stability cannot be addressed without reforms in factor markets. The complex web of laws does not allow enterprises to grow. The next level of reforms should simplify laws in the land and labour markets, which will significantly improve the ease of doing business in the country.

Finally, Modi should know by now that India is being held back by inadequate state capacity. The government does too much in some areas; and it does too little in others. It needs to build capabilities to manage the fastest growing large economy in the world‚Äîbut not fall into the interventionist trap that it so often seems to be doing these days.

Recent history has clearly demonstrated that economic growth is the best solution for poverty alleviation and improving standards of living. Therefore, the challenge for the Modi government would be to take the Indian economy to a sustainable high growth path. And the next two years will be as important, if not more so, than the past three years.

But we can have relations with countries without looking everything from Chinese glasses. 

Mongolia is just across one country from us. It's a shame that we don't have a [close relationship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India‚ÄìMongolia_relations) with them as we should have. All this time governments were afraid of ruffling Chinese feathers. why do these media cartoons write these idiotic headlines? There is life after China. This is more an attempt to forge better relations with India's neighbours and nearby countries.  If so, it's pointless. One Mongolia is nothing compared to what China is doing in Indian ocean. Chinese interests appear to be more pro-China than anti-India focused as such. They want new markets, new opportunities and resources, and they are actively developing it where ever they can. I think India should focus on competing them at that level, rather than doing something because it's anti-China, IMHO. Slightly off topic but in Mongolia, they drink horse's milk. No Doubt , very smart move. As China encircles India - India made a move where it will be sitting on top of it. But, at what cost ? With US technology ? 
China can not be shaken unless it's economy is not shaking....and when it will shake - China will make sure that many shakes with him. 
Perhaps, this is where whole game is going to. With desperation seeping in US and UK over economy and pressure from extremism .....world is perhaps inching towards making teams and playing big games now ! Ghar ke ladke dibba chat rahe, aur baharwale ladko ko sab aata ?",2015-05-18 15:16:03

A notch or more below [Advani's 'Jinnah was secular'?](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4616445.stm) His love for the country is irrelevant.  His 'policies' were so bad he's lucky to have gotten away without having to face trial for criminal negligence and dereliction of duty.  

This is like saying Hosni Mubarak's love for his country was unquestionable.  Unfortunately for him, the Egyptians were smarter than us and threw him in jail before he ended up on postage stamps and school textbooks.  Or for that matter, the Nazis, there is no questioning their love for their Fatherland, it is just their policies that were bad.  duh. Yup his contribution in solving Kashmir Dispute and giving us a nice 4 decade long dynasty rule is unquestionable.",2014-11-14 22:19:08

New Delhi: Finance minister Arun Jaitley is likely to significantly increase public investment in infrastructure in Union Budget 2017, offering fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth at a time when private investment shows no signs of a pick-up.

There is near unanimity that the economy needs to be spurred through higher public investment, unlike last year when there was a significant divergence of opinion over the need for fiscal stimulus, said an official with knowledge of the thinking within the government. The official requested anonymity.

Last year, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry Arvind Subramanian advocated a stimulus, but the minister decided to stick to the fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of gross domestic product (GDP), fearing a backlash from investors and rating agencies.

‚ÄúDifferent schools of thought have argued either in favour of fiscal consolidation and stability or for a less aggressive consolidation and for boosting growth. I have weighed the policy options and decided that prudence lies in adhering to the fiscal targets,‚Äù Jaitley said in his budget speech last year.

ALSO READ | Union budget: Good economics, good politics, or bit of both?

This year, the economic context in which the budget will be presented on 1 February is different.

Investment demand in the economy is expected to contract in 2016-17 by 0.2% from 3.9% growth in 2015-16, according to data released by the government‚Äôs statistics department earlier this month.

The investment scenario further worsened after 8 November when the government invalidated high-value currency notes. Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy Pvt Ltd (CMIE) data released earlier this month showed a sharp fall in new investment proposals in the October-December quarter to Rs1.25 trillion, compared with an average of Rs2.36 trillion worth of new investments seen per quarter in the preceding nine quarters that the Narendra Modi government has been in power.

Clearly, investors have been spooked.

D.K. Srivastava, chief policy adviser at EY India, said the economy needs a ‚Äúsubstantial fiscal stimulus‚Äù to revive growth, which had started slowing even before demonetization. ‚ÄúGovernment can revise upward its fiscal deficit target for next fiscal to 3.5% of GDP from 3% of GDP under the existing fiscal consolidation roadmap. Beyond that it can allow states to borrow more for capital investments.‚Äù

ALSO READ | Should the budget stray from straight and narrow path of fiscal consolidation?

The government may be helped by the recommendations of a committee set up under former secretary in the finance ministry and Bharatiya Janata Party member N.K. Singh to suggest a new roadmap for fiscal consolidation. The committee, which was appointed in May last year, was asked by the finance ministry to examine the need and feasibility of aligning fiscal expansion or contraction with credit contraction or expansion, respectively, in the economy. It has also been asked to examine the feasibility a ‚Äúfiscal deficit range‚Äù . The committee is expected to submit its report on Thursday.

The government official cited earlier said one of the key reasons behind advancing the budget presentation by a month is to give more time to key infrastructure departments such as railways, highways and urban development to implement larger projects as more funds will be made available to them.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month told economists at the NITI Aayog that advancing the date of presentation of the Union budget will help speed up investment expenditure in the productive pre-monsoon months.

What do you think?",iWantMy15Lacs," There is no such thing as alignment in foreign policy especially for countries like India. It's not a zero sum game.

You pursue your own interests. Period. We will work with USA for access to high end tech & invts into Indian econ & work with Russia for energy security & high end defense tech. India should stay firm on non-alignment policy. It had done more good than harm to India in the past, kept us out of unnecessary wars, helped in making new friends easily. I don't think any govt is going to fuck with that. Diplomatic relations are built upon years of work by diplomats staying in those countries. So why try to fix something that is not even broken and would take a lot of time.

Russia is also not in any better condition. USA at least have businesses that provide work to Indian companies. Russia's economy is shrinking and they have put in a lot in Syria. A lot of how long they would continue that they are a superpower would depend on how long they can stretch this crisis.

Policy/Economy,NDA vs. UPA - Same Data Different Stories,46,1v78mm,http://i.imgur.com/msFKJKfh.jpg,34,,st_hill," I am not economist.Current GDP growth estimate by IMF is 4.7% some say actual was 3.5% while CPI inflation is 11.5 %. Indian economy is in total mess if they fail to fix it, it may have similar effect like Argentina. Fast growing China has inflation of 3%  UPA-1 did achieve some good economic figures.
It consequently won.. 

What we should truly evaluate is UPA-2?

I guess the figures would be very different. 



 This is a stupid way of presenting data. Why don't you just show the trend line? These tables are highly prone to misinterpretations. For example, UPA is a 10-year time period vs BJP, a 5 year time period. Best year GDP growth of 9.6 in UPA might be in 2004/2005/2006...which has absolutely no relevance to the disaster that UPA-II is today. It is very much possible that UPA-I reaped the benefits of BJP's policies. 

TL;DR: Just show us the trendline instead of cherry picking data. UPA I reaped the good sowing of NDA..UPA II is reaping the bad sowing of UPA I. In the NDA years, GDP growth was increasing, while in the UPA years, GDP growth turned negative. When NDA started their term, GDP was near 4-5% growth rate, when they ended, GDP growth was at 8.1%. When UPA started their term, GDP growth was at 8.x%, it peaked at 9% and is now down back to 4-5%. UPA-1 inherited a healthy economy from NDA. It was a ride while it lasted. 

UPA-2 suffered because of UPA-1.   So, effectively, UPA managed to magically turn every single rising graph into a falling graph. Spectacular. 

http://planningcommission.nic.in/data/datatable/1612/table_2.pdf 

In 1997-98 (Non NDA Gov), the GDP was 4.2%

NDA boosted it 8.3% by 2003-04. This momentum was maintained in UPA 1 tenure [but later it you see the graph is moving downward.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual) 

In 1998, Infaltion was at 8.26%, by 2004 NDA brought it down to 2.80%. But UPA 1 boosted inflation to 8.70% by 2009 itself!

UPA has been in office for 123 months now and the number of months for which the food inflation stayed above 10% is 78. Thats almost 63% of their total tenure.

Comparing to NDA, they lasted for 72 months, in which the food inflation stayed above 10% only for about 12 months i.e 17% of their tenure. 

Now, i don't know about food prices and other commodity prices, but they surely gone up by 90-900% since the UPA regime took over.

Talking about Fiscal deficit, it was -6.29 in 1998-99, NDA reduced it to -3.88 by 2004. However post 2004, fiscal deficit kept on increasing and now its stands at - 5.15.


 [NDA had current account surplus in 2002, 2003, 2004 \(Again as per above links\). The current account deficit was -2 in 1998. NDA did a nice job and brought it to +2.3 in 2004 which UPA reduced to -5.15 at present. 
](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/india/current-account)

Regarding jobs, NDA created ~61 million jobs, however UPA 1 could only managed to create 2.7million.

 
Also the savings rate was increased from 23.19% in 1998-99 to 32.41 by 2004. Now its 30.81. 

Regarding exchange rate, the depreciation was of 9% during NDA tenure. Its more than 35% during UPA tenure. 

And lastly, the above data of  showing average scores is basically to fool the voters. We were not hit hard by any recession (and this is not i am saying. It was said by Dr. Singh himself). 

Sources: Mostly from tradingeconomics.com, RBI, Nassco, planning commission, Livemint claim check.  
 Inflation, price rise and massive unemployment neutralized most of the UPA's GDP growth rate and prevented it from actually reaching the people. Try this for perspective.

http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html

>The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government. This is called being unambiguous with facts but being open with interpretation. Pretty much my employer's policy. wait... so why is UPA so bad? can i add the [R] tag here.. UPA-I was quite successful,it may not be popular opinion here but India did weather financial crisis better than others.

However UPA-II performed substantially worse because of high interest rates to curb inflation which tanked the growth. http://i.imgur.com/IgMyx.gif",2014-01-15 06:23:34

",Brownhops," It's very hard to ""rank"" PMs like this, because a ranking suggests a single axis. Most PMs have mixed track records, good in some areas, crap in others. 

Since a lot of posters here are quite young, I'll try to cover some of the older PMs:

 * **Nehru**: [4/10]: His economic theories (Fabian socialism) made India suffer, some of his appointments were disastrous (Krishna Mennon), he was geopolitically naive (Panchsheel, UN security council, Sino-Indian war), his political machinations kept some capable men away from power (Patel). In general, he was indecisive and weak. But OTOH, I have to admit that overall he was better than 99% of the other options at that time - his personal stature imbued the PMO with a sense of dignity, he was pretty good as a figurehead - he could speak well and if he had left governance to the officials and confined himself to the ceremonial role, I think he would have been remembered well.

* **Shastri**: [7/10]: Bit of a surprise package. During his early days in office, he'd kept a pretty low profile, almost like late-term MNS. But he rose to the occasion in 1965, when confronted with Pak's Op Grand Slam.  He authorized the military to open a second front - a decisive move that helped India militarily and restored some of the confidence lost in 1962, both among the services and the civilian population

* **Desai**: [1/10]: Fucking disaster. Disgrace to the office of the PM

* **Charan Singh**: N/A: Nonentity but at least not an idiot like Desai

* **Indira Gandhi**: [6/10]: Probably the most divisive of India's PMs. A lot of people overlook that her two terms were very different - her second term was much more low-profile than the 1st one. But overall, she made many mistakes. The emergency of course, but also her nationalization drive (consummating India's flirtation with socialism started by her dad) and her overt political dealings. (FWIW, I don't think her political machinations were any worse than the others', she just carried them out more openly, and broadened her scope of influence, opening the door to other politicians doing the same). She also handled the Khalistan situation badly - Op Blue Star... well, that was a crying shame. On the flip side, she was the most decisive PM India has had - she knew when to get out of the way and let the professionals do their job. India's profile rose with the Asian games, CHOGM and other events on her watch. Most importantly, she handled 1971 perfectly - a lot of folks don't understand *how* badly it could have ended for India, given the US position and the localized issues in Bangladesh, Punjab and Pakistan. That the country came out on top is nothing short of incredible

* **Rajiv**: [4/10]: Pretty much a nonentity, wasted years for India.

* **VP Singh**: [2/10]: Mandal and other BS

* **Gujral**: [3/10]: Personal probity aside, his Gujral doctrine was a fucking mess. Still, at least he had some ideas, shitty though they were My top 3 in chornological order - ( Shastri had too short a stint to know for sure) 

1- Nehru - Made huge mistakes but setup the way things work in India. We have adjusted some minor things but Indian economy's most important features work the way his team designed- Socialist 5 yr Planning, Non-aligned diplomacy, federal structure where center is all powerful, central institutions of great quality like AIIMS, IIT, IIM 

There is no major change apart from liberalization in 1992 that any PM has done to the precedents laid out by him.

2- PV Narsimha Rao - Gave all of us McDonalds and private sector jobs. Without him liberalizing economy, we would be the at least 20-30% poorer as a nation and individually. 

3-  AB Vajpayee - Made major changes to the way India was conducting diplomacy and re-started the process of structural changes PVNR had brought in.  Was Shastri instrumental in anything other than winning the Pak war. Yes, that is a big one, but I have heard people being so impressed with Lal Bahadur Shastri, that I want to know what else did he do? 1. Indira Gandhi (8/10): Split Pakistan into two pieces...this victory is the greatest Indian victory since the Marathas defeated the Mughals. Also, she convinced the Sikhs that an independent country in northwestern India will not even be discussed.  Can you imagine how horrible it would be to have a country that plays Pak and India against each other and shelters agents from both sides?

2. Morarji Desai, Charan Singh, VP Singh, Chandra Shekar, IK Gujral, HD Deve Gowda (7/10). These prime ministers proved that India was not a Single-Party state. They provided the first viable opposition to Congress and showed that whoever wins an election in India will peacefully take power. Also, these Janata Dal governments were among the first to have leaders from Middle-Caste and Lower-Middle Castes...this integrated these communities into democratic India by assuring them that India belonged to them too. Deve Gowda is especially important because he assured non-Brahmin dravidians that India would not treat them like 2nd Class citizens. 

3. Atal Bihari Vajpayee (6.99/10) for improving the budged deficit, undertaking infrastructure projects and for establishing a permanent and resilient opposition party. 

4. PV Narasimha Rao (6.98/10) for liberalizing the economy. Also he was the first non-Nehru dynasty person to serve a 5 year term. This is why his memory is erased in the Congress party...they don't want to acknowledge that the Congress can thrive without the Family. 

5. Manmohan Singh (4/10). For making India enter into some nice nuclear deals. Also, though he was largely a figurehead, at least he made sure an Italian didn't become PM. It would have been might embarrassing for a country known for anti-imperialism to be ruled voluntarily by a European. I know Sonia largely (but not completely) ran the show behind the scenes but still symbolism is important and I'm glad Manmohan was the PM representing India overseas. 

6. The rest were not really consequential positive or negative. 



 Nehru: 8/10. Passed the Hindu bills in spite of opposition from almost all pro Hindu organizations. If not for him Hindus today would have been in same state as Muslims. His relationship with Edwina Mountbatten helped India a lot in partition. Sure he erred on Kashmir but Kashmir anyway could have gone either ways. He is the reason we have democracy. While almost every post colonial democracy failed, India thrived because of him. He actually believed in democracy. Had he died 5-10 years earlier, India would surely have lapsed into dictatorship. His economic philosophies were alright for his times but were carried on for long because of his family being in power. 

Atal Bihari Vajpayee: 7/10. Mistake on Kargil but India coped well. Went big on infrastructure, the best thing to happen. Very few scams during his time compared to any other PM.

Narsimha Rao: 6/10 Started liberalization and helped India break from stagnation.

Shastri: 5/10 Led India well, clean image. Had promise.

Indira Gandhi: 4/10 Emergency and some extreme socialist decision notwithstanding she did well in operation Bluestar and 71 war.

Rajiv Gandhi/Manmohan Singh: -5/10 Took India years back.

Everyone else: 0 they were just holding onto their chair. Confession: I don't know much about PMs before Rajeev, other than Indira. Hence, my rankings:


1. AB Vajpayee (1999-2004) - True globalization. Stable economy, low inflation. Honorable foreign policy, good handling of Kargil. 

2. PV Narasimha Rao (1991-1996) - Good handling of BoP crisis. Tried to make a break from Gandhi Dynasty.

The rest are worthy of contempt:

Negative 1,000,000 - Indira Gandhi (1966-1984) - Started India's love affair with all that's evil today, from sloth and corruption to ineptitude and greed. India's Hitler and Castro rolled into one. May she rot in hell.

Negative 1000 - Rajiv Gandhi (1984-1989) - Perpetuated Momma's stupidities, fine tuned vote bank politics, first PM level corruption.

Negative 500 - Dr Manmohan Singh (2004-) - Took India from ""growing economy"" to ""stagnated economy"" and now disaster story

Negative 500 - VP Singh (1989-1990) - Mandal Commission, indecisive on key policy points

The rest (post Rajeev) are idiots. 1. Narasimha Rao
2. Vajpayee 


3. Manmohan Singh (UPA 1 only)
4. Lal Bahadur shastri (just for winning the war)
 gujral missing in the list?! Shastri - Best Ever
Indira Gandhi - Strong leader..though misuse of power but stability
AB VP - Nuff Said
Nehru - Guided through nascent democracy years
PV N - Filled the void in bringing open markets
VP - Alternative
RG - Unable to use absolute majority to guide india and set up as a success
MMS - Do I even type
Moraji Desai - Opened can of worms of bad governments
Charan Singh - Why was he PM
Nanda - Filler...served his purpose
Deve Gowda - Classic example of what is wrong with Indian electoral system
Chandra Shekar - If there is a way to make this unhappen, please look into it. ModiAll others I don't know PMs before ABVP, so my order is short:

1. Vajpayee
2. Manmohan Singh

But if I'll have to go by what I've read and heard:

Vajpayee

Nehru*

Narasimha Rao

Indira Gandhi*

* excluding their blunders, which seems to almost nullify and makes them a bad one.

Ones I dislike:

Manmohan Singh

Rajiv Gandhi

Indira Gandhi

Nehru

Yep, they make both of my lists. 1 : modi

2 : ABV

3 : LBS

4 : Nehru

5 : PVNR

* further freeing up the foreign direct investment ( FDI) regime, 

* bringing consistency and predictability to tax policy and 

* pushing hard on infrastructure projects, particularly in roads and railways. 
 Indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the govt's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital.

> * NEW DELHI: India's economy may be about to turn the corner on the back of robust public spending that's beginning to have an impact on the ground coupled with strong urban consumer demand, economists and government officials said.Three months of sound industrial growth driven by manufacturing, signs of a pickup in investment, robust indirect tax collections and indications of a mining sector reboot suggest that the government's attempts to revive the economy through reforms and higher public capital spend are working.Going ahead, the tailwinds of falling interest rates, big foreign inflows and a further strengthening of consumer demand in anticipation of the Seventh Pay Commission's award should propel the economy forward, said the analysts and officials.

They are not propping up India because of goodness of their heart. Did anyone applaud the masterstroke that was Sri Lanka. A regime change was bought about certainly due to Indian influence which India will not confirm or deny. This will certainly has upset China, as Rajapakse was China's sweetheart. Modi's foreign policy is look east which IMHO will reap benefits.  This is the statement I have been barking from past 2 years everywhere , But I always get shitty replies -"" times have changed, we should forget Russia "" , ""we are democracies"", we are that or we are this. Simple thing No Super power will allow other countries to develop, which may challenge them, in 1970's they sucked Chinese to oppose soviet union, Now they want relations with India to stop china, tomorrow they do same thing against India with Pakistan .  In 2014, a slow year for the Indian economy, India grew at a rate of somewhere around 5%. (Estimates vary from 7-4.x, so 5% is a reasonable middle of the ground number.) 

This meant an addition to Indian GDP of about 100 billion dollars. In comparison, Pakistan has an economy of around 245 billion dollars.

So in a bad year, India will add to its economy half a Pakistan, and in a good year, India will add to its economy one full Pakistan. In a decade or two, the relative economic disparity between India and Pak, which is at 10:1 today, will be around 20:1.

How can such a tiny power, that cannot keeps its own children safe, keep India in check? American strategic thinkers are many thing, but math illiterate they are not. 

Forget these conspiracy theories peddled by foolish NAM types, and too clever by half hidden-Islamists, and venture forth boldly into the future.  I don't believe that the American political system is capable of long term/very long term foreign policy strategies this article proposes it's doing. 

America's foreign policy is like any other country's foreign policy, just reacting to what pops up day to day. Somedays you're an enemy, and somedays you're a friend. ",2015-02-18 06:46:55

IMO, FSB is a good bill, passed at the wrong time. OP, you have spent your time writing stuff up - educating people and sharing something you believe in and that itself is commendable. 

Most people don't even know the basics of economy - so this post could be a good starting point for further discussions. I saw somebody calling you out as a socialist - and that shows how under-educated even our elite is(assuming those on /r/india are elites). You could perhaps expand more on why our government decided to spend a large amount of cash on welfare policies and compare the same with few first world nations. 

Personally, I believe govt should just focus on governing and the rest should be left to the economy. They do a bad job at everything they touch so policies like National Corruption Guarantee Scheme are bound to fail in India. But even while I say that, the policies themselves are not that bad. Guaranteed employment, food, education etc are all very good and noble ideas. Hopefully, someday we will have a stronger economy to implement these ideas well.  Does it mean that if a lot of people stop using cars value of Rupee may go up?

Also good work OP. I think it's a combination of both the export/import gap as explained, but also the result of economic slowdown in India and continued questions about India's fiscal responsibilities.

Policy/Economy,Perhaps a decisive moment in history of India. Anna Announces party. What's your take ?,34,xmb9m,http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Team-Anna-to-form-political-party-to-fight-corruption-confirms-Kejriwal/Article1-907640.aspx,53,,identity_none," I would like to know their stand/opinion on other stuff before deciding to vote for them.

One of their team members Prasanth Bushan is a staunch supporter of Azaadi assholes of kashmir.He wants India to give up kashmir. 
Other members such as Aruna Roy openly bat for maoists . and they don't have a opinion on economics etc. If they manage to come to power , it will be Gandhi/Nehru redux and will be a disaster. I hope they do well. Thing I am afraid is that it might split the opposition vote and give Congress another win. One more term for Congress and I think we are doomed. Should give them one chance. Things couldn't be worse anyway Sooner or later he will have to open his mouth to voice his opinions on issues other than corruption and quite frankly he is a simpleton.

Lets hope he focuses completely on the corruption agenda, gets enough votes to be, at the very least, a strong enough voice as part of a coalition with any of the two parties and force them into implementing greater transparency measures and strong anti corruption laws. Where is the party? Will they serve drinks? Nothing is going to happen. For a party to be successful funds are needed. No one's going to back up Anna. We suffer from a lack of options in politics so I welcome any serious attempt to break the two party system. Unfortunately this party will probably be very extreme in most things. ref: AH saying alcoholics should be hanged and ambivalence on separatist issues. This is silly. Now they will just split the anti-incumbency vote, which would have gone to the BJP, and let Congress win again. They have no source of funding and no agenda. Heck, they dont even have unity within their own group!! Only Kejriwal and his coterie may think contesting elections is a good idea. You cant win elections like this. They'd have done better if they had remained an NGO and campaigned against corrupt candidates by making the public more aware of who the right candidate is. Now the whole anti-corruption thing is going to fizzle out. I would really like to see them do well, but ""Power Corrupts"". Also, some of his comments on personal freedoms are disturbing. They're likely to merge with the NDA. I can see this turning into a grand failure. Anna knows zilch about running a country and Swami Ramdev is only advocating the Hindutva brand of politics. 

The Indian economy will be in a deeeep slump if these clowns actually come to power.  how does he plan to get enough candidates to make a impact ?

From facebook ??  What would be a good name for the party? Why not - the have struck a chord with apathetic India and made uninterested middle classes think, and make their voices heard. Their strategies are not working to their specific objective, but their larger objectives can be met only politically.

Let them give it a shot. I am not sure if they will be able to even get a single seat in parliament, but if they have a long term view and can hold the group together, they may have a chance. Well they'll never be credible enough for me.With the maoist and the azadi douches supporters on their team,they can expect  nothing more than a middle finger salutes from me. Here, I was hoping parties like LokSatta would do better. You either need experienced personnel or intellectuals in your party to form a stable government once elected. Anna's party currently has neither and I don't see experienced politicians joining the party. The success of Anna's party will solely depend on how many real intellectuals(from varying disiplines) he is able to attract.  [I will quote myself](http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/xk0pf/team_anna_asks_india_should_we_start_a_political/c5n27p3), also, I can see me being flogged coz I drink and do not pray or go to temple etc. 99% of voters in India vote based on caste,liquor and money so sadly I can't see this party having much impact on the elections.",2012-08-04 03:31:07

Earlier this month in Japan, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his government seeks to pursue economic policies that will make India ‚Äúthe most open economy in the world‚Äù. His statement was lost amid the domestic din following his controversial decision to pull high-value banknotes out of circulation.

Chinese President Xi Jinping made a similar point on the sidelines of a conference in Peru. He pledged to further open up the Chinese economy so that the benefits of economic integration were shared more widely. These parallel statements by the leaders of the two largest emerging economies come at a time when protectionist sentiment is gradually casting a long shadow in the developed world, especially after the election of Donald Trump as the next US president. Global trade by value has also been shrinking.

The backlash against globalization in several rich countries is because a growing numbers of voters there believe that free trade has harmed them, as jobs have moved to Asia. A robust debate is still under way among economists whether technology has been a bigger reason why median incomes have stagnated in these countries, but the dominant narrative blames free trade.

The situation in India and China is quite different. Millions have been pulled out of poverty because of the opportunities offered by globalization. Economist Branko Milanoviƒá has provided one of the most evocative visuals of what he has described as the greatest reshuffle in global incomes in the past three centuries. His elephant diagram shows that the two groups that have seen the most rapid rise in incomes in the two decades after 1988 are the few in the top income percentile (the global elite) and the hundreds of millions around the median income (mainly people from India and China).

This fact partly explains why leaders such as Modi and Xi are committing themselves to open economies even while Western countries that originally pushed for globalization are getting attracted to protectionism. Their middle class has been one of the undisputed beneficiaries of globalization, and hence has a strong interest in more economic integration with the rest of the world.

But what precisely does being the most open economy in the world entail? Modi did not provide any details. Trade policy has definitely become less restrictive since the advent of economic reforms: import tariffs that were once among the highest in the world have come down dramatically. The goal set by the initial reformers that average tariff levels should come down to East Asian levels has been met. There is no doubt that the old protectionist walls have been dismantled.

The trade-policy reforms over the past 25 years have also resulted in better trade outcomes. The trade/gross domestic product ratio has doubled. India, however, can never reach the levels of openness of a country such as Singapore because of its size. Smaller countries tend to have a higher trade ratio because their domestic markets aren‚Äôt big enough.

The record is less encouraging when it comes to trade in services, despite the success of the software services industry. Trade in services usually increases in tandem with prosperity, so India still has some distance to go. The other two indicators of openness are restrictions on foreign direct investment (FDI) and capital account controls. India has far fewer FDI restrictions, though some sectoral caps persist, but the experience of China shows that there is an umbilical link between higher FDI and more international trade.

India has also brought down most of its barriers to capital inflows, though there are still controls. The standard measure for capital account openness‚Äîthe Chinn-Ito index‚Äîshows that India has far more controls on capital flows compared to its peers. The traditional view within the economic policy establishment has been that capital-account convertibility should be a gradual process, and deeply dependent on durable macroeconomic stability as well as a strong banking system. The Modi government has as yet shown no sign that it has broken with this convention.

India is definitely a far more open economy than it was before the economic reforms of 1991. Millions of Indians have benefitted from its integration with the global economy, though that has increased the income gap between those who could take advantage of globalization and those who could not. India and China should be important voices in the protection of the liberal international order‚Äîboth through a more active role in global institutions and through domestic reform that advances the cause of global economic integration.

Should India and China stand up for globalization when its advocates are dwindling across the developed world? Tell us at views@livemint.com

The government is already working on a scheme for financing higher education infrastructure needs, particularly research infrastructure requirements, he added.

  NEW DELHI: India with a large domestic economy will be less affected by changes in growth and monetary policy in the new set-up under Donald Trump administration, S&P; Global Ratings said today.  

 

  In a report on effect of Trump's victory in the presidential elections on Asia-Pacific economies, S&P; said many key US policies under the new administration remain undefined, leading to unusual uncertainty around the baseline outlook.  

 

  ""The effect of changes in the US growth and monetary policy on Asia's trade and general financial market confidence, whether positive or negative, will be greater on smaller and more open economies of the region,"" S&P; Global Ratings' Asia-Pacific Chief Economist Paul Gruenwald said.  

 

  ""Countries with large domestic economies -- China, Japan, India and Indonesia -- will be less affected.""  

 

  S&P; said it will have to wait until Trump's economic team is in place and its policy intentions become clearer before firming up its view on the effect and the associated risks on the Asia-Pacific.  

 

  US President-elect Trump will assume charge on January 20.  

 

  ""A Trump administration's impact on the Asia-Pacific will likely appear in two main areas -- one with a large downside and one with a moderate upside,"" Gruenwald added.  

 

  S&P; said the potential downside scenario for the Asia-Pacific is trade policy where Trump has advocated a punitive import tariff of 45 per cent on China based on his assessment of ""currency manipulation"".  

 

  ""Such an action will almost certainly generate a strong response from Chinese authorities and risks starting a trade and investment war between the world's two largest economies, which is in no country's interest,"" Gruenwald said.  

 

  On the upside, S&P; said Trump has argued for Keynesian- style infrastructure spending increases and tax cuts, which could boost US growth and demand for Asia's exports, at least in the short run.

and have jointly dislodged to emerge as the best states to do business in the country, according to a report by the World Bank and DIPP.



Chhattisgarh, and occupied the 4th, 5th and 6th slots in the index, based on implementation of DIPP's 340-point Business Reform Action Plan.



""States are really competing with each other. Healthy competition is happening among all the states. Everybody is monitoring everybody's performance,"" Commerce and Industry Minister said while releasing the report.



She however said that more efforts are needed to encourage states like (at 31st) and other north-eastern regions to improve their business climate.



Nagaland, Manipur, and stand at 26th, 28th, 29th and 30th position.



""There is a long way to go,"" she said, adding that this time 15 states have implemented reforms suggested by the ministry as compared to seven last year.



Interestingly, eight out of top 10 states are ruled by BJP-led NDA. While Telengana is ruled by TRS, Uttarakhand has a Congress government.



The business reform action plan for states and UTs includes reforms on 58 regulatory processes, policies, practices, or procedures spread across 10 reform areas spanning the lifecycle of a typical business. These are mainly single window clearance, tax reforms, labour and environment reforms, dispute resolution and construction permit.

Policy/Economy,[R] Why are young educated Indians overwhelmingly in favor of right wing economic policies compared to the rest of the developed world ?,4,250xy2,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/250xy2/r_why_are_young_educated_indians_overwhelmingly/,17,"Outside of sources like Fox news, western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8. The same general idea is reflected in the educated youth/college grads in the developed world too.

Why does India have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ?

Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.

I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?

 I'm socially on the left wing, but right wing when it comes to economics. I'm totally for a free market economy. I wish India would adopt the [Nordic model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model).  >Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Sorry but your understanding of economics seems to be flawed. India is a mixed economy - State and Private sector are involved in production and it is not a free market economy, but a heavily regulated economy in which the state intervenes to correct the natural equilibrium of demand & supply.

The model you are referring to is the Nordic model (Social Market Economy to use the technical term). In this the type of set up there is actually more free market than the crony free market of the US or other ""free market"" economies.

A Nordic model is one that is capitalistic but tempered by an implementation of Ordoliberalism which says markets are free, competition decides if companies thrive or fall BUT there will be regulation to ensure fair competition.

>why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Who wants to move to a free market corpotocracy? What (and I generalise) a lot of young Indians want is labour law reforms, more transparent rule making while reducing discretionary nonsense that is the cornerstone of Indian bureaucracy right now, support for infrastructure and consequently letting the private sector do what it does best. Make money, create goods & services while creating jobs. Nobody says that we shouldn't invest tax money in poverty alleiviation programs or investing in infrastructure or run schools & hospitals or any such thing! What we want is an end to the Maai-Baap sarkaari model that the CONgress has imposed upon this nation for 50 years. A model in which the government uses hand-outs to control votes, while keeping the nation poor and dependant on the government for their daily bread & butter.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

This is the second time I am seeing your admiration for FDR and not questioning that, but what do you understand of his policies?

Have you truly looked at Modi's economic philosophies? Till Kujliwala said crony capitalism, nobody ever accused Modi / Guj of crony capitalism. 

Anyways, back to the topic on hand,

FDR's key solutions to recovery were as follows,

* Recovery of the Agriculture sector
* Create jobs at stable wages (in reality though, wages dipped while the number of jobs created increased-check wages paid out via the WPA if you need clarity on this)
* Using a fiscal deficit (atleast in the 1st & 2nd New Deals) to fund the WPA to create infrastructure.
* Increased corporate taxation (it is another matter that this was absolutely watered down)

There are other Fiscal policies / Monetary policies which I will not discuss now as it is not relevant to the point I am trying to make below.

Look at Modi's Gujarat minus whatever blinkers you might have.

* The only state to have grown it's Primary (agriculture) sector at 10% plus, while the rest of the country grew at roughly 2%. While critics point out to other ""advanced states"" like Maha or TN and compare GDP growth rates, keep in mind the growth patterns of these states is NOT SUSTAINABLE. They have moved directly from a primary economy to a tertiary economy skipping entirely the manufacturing phase which is where jobs are created.

* As a net share - Manufacturing+Agriculture contribute roughly 60% of the states GDP, while in states like Maha and TN this would be at a paltry 35%. Keep in mind, nationally Agri+Manufacturing account for close to 70% of all employment.

* State with the LOWEST unemployment figures - The above thrust on the primary & secondary are paying off. Jobs are being created. Have real wages dipped? yes, but that is more of a function of demand & supply equilibirum and less of ""Evil Adani pays less hurr durr"". 

* Taxation in Guj (despite all accusations of crony capitalism aside) has increased, it has the highest contribution of tax revenue as a percentage of total revenue is at 80% which is the highest in the country! Clearly, all that free land is paying off in the form of increased state taxes.

How does any of the above equate to crony capitalism? Why would a crony capitalist develop the primary sectory where 60% of our population works? If anything, thrust on the agricultural sector+increased job creation+increased taxation were aside from the fiscal tweakings a corner stone of FDR's New Deal.

Truly you seem to be spouting the same gibberish less informed people spout, you might want to look at the macro economic indicators before you come to any conclusions.

Not every Chaddi wearing Sanghi is a brain dead communalist, some of us have decided to vote for him more because of his economic policies and not for whatever else people vote for him.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?

Really? Simply take a list of the big name MNC's and Indian manufacturing powerhouses operating out of Guj and Adani / Ambani would be just one amongst the Fords, Samsungs, Peugeots, Renaults, Lakshmi Steels, Mahindra's, Tata's etc etc. It is sad that off all the bad things Kujliwala has done, he has used his goodwill in convincing people that Modi's gujarat supports crony capitalism! Not much original thought in this. Essentially your entire question = ""they are doing, why aren't we?""

>Outside of sources like Fox news, western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8. The same general idea is reflected in the educated youth/college grads in the developed world too.

Neither the media, nor the students, are contributing to their nations' growth.

>Why does India have the complete opposite attitude towards economics ?

Because it's required. The kids joining International Socialist Organization live in first world countries that can afford unemployment benefits.

>Instead of moving towards mixed economy welfare states like Western Europe or Scandinavia, why do some people want to move towards a completely free market corporatocracy ?

Because we have the largest number of extremely poor people. We need to make money to feed them.

>Why do we want leaders like Narendra Modi to be like Ronald Regan or Hitler ? Wouldn't Franklin D Roosevelt be a better role model ? FDR took America out of one of the worst financial meltdowns in American history.

Ronald Reagan was one man's comparison. In any case, all American presidents have sworn by free enterprise, it's only their socialism that has varied in degrees. Modi is pro-welfare too, just not a welfare state to the exclusion or detriment of private enterprise.

>Is it just an overextension after years of misrule under the Congress party ? I don't want to believe that Indians are inherently more selfish than everybody else.

Selfish is a good thing. We want to make money. We want to pay taxes. We want the poor to be helped, but don't hold us back from our own destinies.

>I think a bloated bureaucratic license raj is as bad as a business oligarchy like Russia or any of the South American countries. Why do people want to move from one corrupt system to another ?
Personally I doubt there will be any major change in economic or foreign policy no matter who comes to power, but the mentality of India's urban educated youth is interesting.

Meh. Your p.o.v is too popular and stopped being relevant after the BOP crisis.

**India has no option. If not Modi, then someone from the economic right.** I believe it is mostly due to a false sense of entitlement and upbringing, The fact that you have had a decent life and have never had to live through abject poverty leads to apathy towards the underprivileged. So you tend to root for policies that will benefit your current standing, which in case of educated young Indians are the right wing policies. Because America and the west have strayed in too much to the right. We have strayed on too much to the left. You're comparing two different things. On the political scale, I am a left-social libertarian. Economically, I am liberal but to an extent. I believe in laissez-faire capitalism but with government oversight and regulation to prevent monopolies, pollution, and gouging customers. Essentially, rules that would apply to an individual to ensure the harmonious functioning of society, should apply to a corporation as well.

Now if the economic climate is way to the right of me, I would look like I am on the left of the spectrum. In an economic climate that is way to the left of me, I would look like I am on the right of the spectrum.

The first case applies to the US. I have been here since '99. I think the economic policies are pretty much brain-dead and have gone too far to the right. Intense deregulation is what led to the financial crisis of '08. Corporations have way too much power, and you essentially have state-sanctioned monopoly ensured by the revolving door between corporations and Washington (current head of FCC used to work for Comcast for example). 

In India, you have the other extreme. Far-left policies and the disastrous experimentation with Fabian socialism have stunted the economy and slowed down development. The Indian economy is comparatively hostile to entrepreneurship, although the situation is way better than it was, say 20 years ago. In fact, it was a combination of Nehru's and Indira's policies that brought India to the brink of bankruptcy in '89/'90, and it was only because of liberalization at that point that India's economy was saved. The additional liberalization during the NDA years also helped.

So this, in short, is why I favor regulation in the US, but deregulation in India. What India needs to do is learn from the mistakes the US made and not go too far in that direction. Because India is too far to the left economically relative to the US. You can't equate the current right wing of US with anything. According to their principles even their past governments would have been considered liberal. **Attention!** Please keep in mind that the OP of this thread has chosen to mark this post with the **[R]eddiquette Enforced** tag.

> western media is deeply cynical of unregulated capitalism - especially after the global financial crisis of 2007-8

This is essentially the biggest criticism of capitalism. If you have analysed financial crises you will see only one pattern - no two crises are similar. You know why? Because after every crisis we learn a new thing about how economy can go wrong. In the 2007-08, Wall Street didn't understand the risks of what they were doing completely. Now we have better sense and hence are trying to implement Basel-3. I'm sure there will be more crises and each time we will learn a new thing.

tl;dr: 2007-08 crisis doesn't mean capitalism is bad. ",2014-05-08 21:30:13

Politics,RIP Sushmaji!,2078,cn2k4z,https://i.redd.it/c7xfb27o8ze31.jpg,71,,sudden_dust," A powerful orator,people's minister. Gone too soon I will ALWAYS remember her as a kind lady with a helping hand, just a Tweet away!


Stuck in Arab country? just a Tweet

Lost Passport in abroad? just a Tweet

Need Visa for treatment? just a Tweet Her last tweet very fitting. Om Shanti she did good. great service for the nation. if there is an afterlife journey, I hope she gets first-class tickets. rest in peace In an ideal world, she would have been BJP's PM candidate The BJP regime had the finest leaders and she's the second one who's gone. It just breaks my heart. it's really unbelievable that there are political leaders in a corrupt country who wants to work for their nation and she was one of them. I hope her energy transcends into the party to inspire  other leaders to work with  the same principles. sorry to be a noob, but can someone please explain? I understand that to be the flag of Japan, and ik that she was minister of external affairs, but did she have a special link with the country? A beautiful cartoon, but spoilt by the huge and in-your-face watermark. I understand the need for an artist's need for recognition, but not at the expense of spoiling the art itself‡•§ Delhi lost its only two women former-CMs in a short period. There is a very strong and unnecessary undercurrent of some people. These are the people who say they will not be mourning her death because she was an accessory of the Hindutva agenda. 

Like, why beat your chest about such matters? The woman did more than your social media addicted ass will ever do. Some people are just a vehicle of ideas than.. Actual people. The Ironlady of India. Would have been nice if it was like the setting sun. May her soul rest in piece... I understand the sentiment, but it's a terrible cartoon. Her bindi represented as the setting sun (as someone explained below)? I didn't realise it was 'setting' from the image -- unless I am missing something here. Or is she up in the clouds? Like ascending to heaven? Either ways, there is no significantly poignant message, and that watermark really ruins it. I thought the words were part of the cartoon, and was trying to decipher it. RIP Why do we always get consumed by irrationality when it comes to the demise of public figures. Below a clip of a great, powerful minister denying a student his identity

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBQn1mKcfB4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBQn1mKcfB4) Can i get some F's in the chat bois I've seen her on TV for most of my rather long life, and she never looked a day above 50, right until yesterday. Unfortunately, she also didn't look a day below 50 even when I saw her the first time on TV in 90s. I don't mean to call her ugly: she's a beautiful and elegant lady. I'm just talking about the skincare regime. Such consistency in one's looks through many years is only something bollywood people tend to successfully pull off and she did it. She truly is an inspiration to us all in that department. 

Most people who read the news have mixed thoughts on Sushma ji and despite all the distasteful stuff in her record (e.g. getting papers done for Chhota Modi), there was some good work done by her too. I have great respect for her for being a woman and doing so well in politics, setting an example for all women in the country. She could've made a ton more money and name for herself being a Jethmalani-level lawyer but she stuck with politics till the end, so, somewhere deep down, there was a genuine desire to help the public. 

I have a theory regarding her death. She worked so hard for this party full of idiots, dedicated her life to it, and got it to the greatest heights it has ever seen. Then, Modiji decides to give her job to a man 3 levels her junior and doesn't offer her anything in the cabinet. Not even the Ministry of silly walks. This was part of the removal of the old guard. Jaitley didn't get anything, Rajnath Singh got demoted. Subramanian Swamy didn't even get a gift basket.  So, that was hurtful but she treaded on.

Then, the biggest day in BJP's history happens. It's the one thing they've ever done that gets near-unanimous approval from the public. And Sushma ji hears of it first on Rajya Sabha TV. Then she tweets her bittersweet mood: happy that this happened to the BJP in her lifetime, and deeply sad that she wasn't involved. Not even given a slice of this cake she's been baking all these years. 

BJP says they did the #370Delete because the political climate was apt. Who made the political climate such? People like Sushma. A lot of those people are sitting out, and that can be painful. Some of them took it better than others. 

I refuse to believe that her last tweet wasn't sent with mixed emotions and was purely an expression of happiness. Why did she mention life (or death) at all instead of sending a simple congratulations. That, my friends is how Modi, in a way, killed Sushma, and that's why he showed tears at the funeral. But he had to do what he had to do.

I don't mean to smear any party or individuals, this is just a theory. Hate the game, not the player. Sushma ji's death might just have been a lesson for us in how cruel and emotionally draining politics can get. Many of us complain about office politics and that small group of bitchy coworkers but we never realize that there are people undergoing situations fifty times worse than us and have to deal with office politics from the best fucking politicians in the country. Is it on record? She kept saying Hindi is national language, wasted money on it's propogation. She would have been a great Hindi teacher in cow belt, wasted her talent in politics.",2019-08-07 20:43:14
Politics,Congress committing suicide: Congress whip in Rajya Sabha resigns to protest party's stand on Article 370.,502,cm9t18,https://www.indiatoday.in/amp/india/story/article-370-congress-whip-in-rajya-sabha-bhubaneswar-kalita-resigns-1577458-2019-08-05,117,,Blank_eye00," Weren't they supporting UAPA amendment a few days back? What is wrong with them? It's good for Congress and the country. About time the party is dissolved. The party died long back and it should be given burial.

What BJP does hardly infuriates me. I hate their ideology and what it stands for. But the pusillanimity of the parties outside NDA is unacceptable. No coherence, no unity. They are just letting BJP run away with everything. The country deserves better not these spineless idiots. His argument makes sense, as long as one carefully distinguishes 'the right thing to do' from ' the politically expedient thing to do'.  

It *is* political suicide for the INC to stand against something that a majority of the country would oppose. That would just allow the BJP to cast the INC as ""muslim loving"" , ""traitors to India"" etc, and that would find traction among large swathes of the population.

What the majority believe, especially in  an education/thinking challenged polity like ours, is not necessarily correct. But this is too subtle a challenge for the INC to overcome as it stands today, battered and ramshackle and bereft of effective leadership. Excellent. I await the day that the BJP and their supporters point to an empty congress bench and yell ""THEY DID IT"" or ""THEY DID IT FIRST"".

In case people forget - the congress won its previous elections as members of a coalition, but they still got something like 20% of the total votes. Naice exit strategy. Congress Stand in Rajya Sabha is primarily because of Ghulam Nabi Azad being the leader of opposition. He is from Kashmir. Going by the glee shown by Congress leaders or workers elsewhere, it‚Äôs clear that they are in favour of the bill as they still harbour hopes of getting the Hindu vote. I bet that the MP would join BJP very soon. https://twitter.com/brijeshkalappa/status/1158390992606654464

this basically explains congress of today. Everyone supporting this bill are cheering cause they are not sitting in kashmir right now? There's a reason there are So many troops in kashmir and why curfew has been imposed and wifi has been put off: but these aren't permanent. This is going to aggrevate the opposition in kashmir and a civil war may occur ( I pray it won't). It is easy to cheer when you are not at risk. This is setting a very dangerous precedent and whilst I agree smth had to be done, people's lives have to be taken into account, and frankly I don't think they have been. At least some people in the congress still have some brains. https://twitter.com/milinddeora/status/1158405693067558912?s=19
Hopefully the leaders of the congress in the lok sabha do a better job tomorrow. So sprcial status of Assam must revoked and see Kaliya reaction TIL - Whip is not just a slang, but an official way of describing that position. Huh..!! 371 should also be revoked.

Politics,I wish I was well informed in subjects or had opinions like you guys.,237,crzhie,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/crzhie/i_wish_i_was_well_informed_in_subjects_or_had/,76,"Every post I see, there's someone who's passionate about the topics ranging from politics to sports to finance and I have opinions on none of them that can be backed with facts. It's like some of you are like walking encyclopedias. 

Just a random appreciation post.",Cynaren," Lol, there's no such thing like too well informed. The people whom you're talking about are either experts in the subject or are avid readers. All you have to do to make your wish come true is to know about your own line of work, and read about the topics you're interested in. For example, I'm a medical professional and I have responded to a couple of related posts, and since I like the posts related to politics too, I read up on the topic before responding. It's about how badly you want to know the topic, not about how much you already know Firstly don't club everyone into one ultra smart person. A highly upvoted post/comment will be likely from an expert and naturally it will be rare. Secondly, if you are in awe of this level of expertise in general, then it is likely you haven't got expertise of this level in any area. But you will, as you grow up. And also as you act on this awe from now itself, if you do that. Thirdly, when you start doing research or reading you will realise how much you are capable of and it's almost guaranteed you underestimate that as of now. Vastly. I literally spout bs until someone calls me out on it and then I have to read about it to not make a fool of myself any further Read more on topics you like to master. It takes years of passionately reading different voices on topic to form an informed opinion. Even a less read person can sound well informed to someone who doesn't read at all.

The point is : read. Read about stuff you like. Make time for it. Instead of knowing every little news on Internet, focus on what you want to read. 

We have an information mountain at our hands, but we have to pick what kind of info we want. Don't get overwhelmed by the size of the mountain, pick the stones that you need. 

That's all you need. _I am the wisest man alive, for I know one thing, and that is that I know nothing._

~Plato Read both sides of the story from many sources and then form your own opinions. Everyone has an agenda. Relatable If you start reading a good Newspaper regularly then it will help you build opinions. You think people here or anywhere online actually know what they're talking about? Oh, you innocent babe! You are good man. These days it is so easy to have an opinion. You are way above the rest of the crowd. Stay there. No sweetie, people are really lonely here Nobody here knows anything. Everyone is just faffing, or at least 90% of them. None of us are walking encyclopaedias. Each on of us just knows more than usual about 1-2 subjects. But everyone specialises in different subjects, so it feels like everyone knows everything. Lol half of the upvotes on political posts are from bots and astroturfing is the way of life for pro govt voices here. TBH, many posters do appear *opinionated* but often speak without coming across as *well-informed* - and resort to *ad hominem* attacks and downvoting if asked for validation of their claims.  So don't be shy and join the crowd... Beg to differ on the politics bit. Indians and political information is not always well informed and involves a lot of cherry picked information. Both left and right thinkers are guilty of this. You just gotta read more. Bonus if you have personal experience or have been involved with the subject of the discussion. Who says people here are well informed lmao üòÇ. Bruh we are all just shitposting.

Second. Its not rocket science like they want to think it is. If you really want facts, then you'll have to do your own first hand research. But do remember that facts are only bits and pieces that form a **narrative** and a narrative typically stands on both fact based and rumor/propaganda based opinions.

The opinions you typically hear from different people reflect their support for a narrative, its immaterial for them whether its based on facts or not. In general, a narrative is supported by both facts and a bit of propaganda by media. We live in an age of information warfare, so propaganda is bound to exist on both sides. If one side ceases to create propaganda, the other side spreading it wins in the narrative battle. And losing this battle could mean losing both elections and public support.

Regarding which narrative to support for, read all the facts and opinions in support and against that narrative, and then ask your heart. Your own prejudices will also contribute in forming that narrative. Some people have a pro-establishment bias while others have an anti-establishment one, so they'll accept or reject narratives based on that bias. You can also be a centrist and support bits and pieces of both narratives, and your support for a narrative can even change as new information comes up. Hey that‚Äôs OK. You might be informed or be opinionated or passionate about other things. No one gets to decide if someone who has opinions on politics is smarter than someone who has opinion on smartphones or video games. 

Go easy on life. It‚Äôs not a race to be smart. Look at the strength of the sub. 242k members. Obviously there will experts from different fields. Not too late mate, you can learn too. Read about logical reasoning and critical thinking, then apply it to world affairs.

Also nobody is fully informed about anything. We learn something new every day. Well let me leave you with a tidbit. There is a term in psychology called the Dunning Kruger effect. It states that people mistakenly assess their cognitive ability as greater than it is. 

So while people may have an opinion on everything , unless they are an expert or at the very least have all the facts on a topic to make a proper assessment most people are usually speculating. Depends on what u are interested in As someone here already commented, it's about how badly you want to learn the subject. I am crazy about software engineering - building beautiful, maintainable, secure software. Almost everyday, I read on topics design patterns, distributed systems, etc. There's a LOT to learn as I am just starting out, but it feels good when you understand what the ""pros"" in the team are talking about. 

In the end, it's all about hard work. India has 1.3 billion people. So definitely somebody knows something. You also something about something. ! Don't fall for the peer pressure. Just chill.  The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.‚Äù   
‚Äï **Socrates** You are not alone. Here, if [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92Hf_Dm-HiY) makes you feel better :) An important thing to remember, I think, is that not everybody who offers opinions on a subject is an expert, or even moderately knowledgeable. Most people comment on things with only a rudimentary understanding of what‚Äôs going on- hence we have so much misinformation floating around. It‚Äôs easy to feel as though you don‚Äôt know anything compared to the scholars on the internet who seem to have swallowed the encyclopedia brittanica whole, but remember that‚Äôs usually not the case. 

Also, like someone else said, knowing things is easy, as long as you make an active effort. Join the world news sub. Read a newspaper. Educate yourself through the internet. The good thing about this generation is that information is only a click away. But keep in mind, most accounts of events, whether current or historical, come heavily biased, so steer clear of forming any concrete views based on one piece of information.

Also also, find what interests you, and the information will come to you naturally! When we first started dating, I was supremely in awe of my ex because he knew so much about engineering and technology and politics. I got caught up trying to overload myself on those topics before realizing that I knew just as much as he did, except about history and literature and architecture. While it‚Äôs great to have a basic understanding of everything, don‚Äôt feel obligated to know everything about the topics you don‚Äôt enjoy. Same feeling just read books and newspaper, 

honestly reading newspaper is also quite fine 

you'll soon see yourself having an opinion as well I have legitimately never seen someone here who was accurately informed about something here,  been lurking a long time.  It's just rabid and opinionated people.  People here make a lot of fun of Quora,  but it is far far better than Reddit in terms of getting information / explanation.  Specifically about politics. Follow subreddit like r/truereddit I've been using Reddit for only an year and it seems i know more about the US political scene than the Indian one... lol. I spend hours and hours of my day, everyday to learn about a variety of stuffs other than the ones I'm already well versed at.

It just takes the will dude. You have to love doing it. I'm no special than you. 

That and ignore the r/iamverysmart and r/thathappened jackasses. It's people like them is why Reddit has become a cesspool of misinformation which drives away  real discussion.

A few years back if you had a well informed but controversial opinion, people discussed and debated you before coming to a conclusion. Now they just downvote you and link to those subs and kill and discussion.

Case in point: yesterday a guy said on this sub that he doesn't know Thanos. He's a very active Redditor which means he spends a fuck ton of time on the internet. If he didn't hear about the biggest movie villain of this decade it just feels weird because the net is full of memes and jokes and references.


I just pointed that out and got downvoted to Oblivion. Fuckers never even stopped and thought that you would have to be living under a mountain to not hear about the movie event of the century. You should visit the LNRDTs. That's where you'll see the real randia. I think we've got more opinions than information actually Is this thread a joke? All of us are passionate about something.

He still fucking won. Modiji will fight next US Presidential elections against Trump Is he implying that BJP workers dont actually work hard themselves and only win in elections cuz of MODI‚Äôs name? Ha. 

Eat that Indian voters. You voted for name and not for work. straight from the¬†horse's mouth. We should elect Gambhir as the next PM then IK and Gambhir can fight it out in the field.

Shah for PM confirmed.... Given the steps Narendra Modi has started to take in his second term, voters, even those who had swayed from him 2019 (chances of which are quite less considering his increased vote % this time), will vote en masse for him in 2024 if he decides to contest as BJP's PM candidate once again.

Only one Parliamentary session has passed and his govt. has got passed many crucial bills like Triple Talaq, Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, NIA Bill etc. and above all, scrapping of Article 370 and Jammu-Kashmir Reorganization Bill which no one had imagined. In the upcoming session, he is planning to move anti-conversion Bill. With actions like these, I don't think that BJP candidates will have to work hard to garner votes. Modi will have already done his job by then. You also work hard so that you don't have to depend on riots or soldiers.",2019-08-11 03:45:53
Politics,How do we deal with the growing fundamentalism in our country?,42,cyl264,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cyl264/how_do_we_deal_with_the_growing_fundamentalism_in/,31,"I have had lots of discussions lately with friends and colleagues. Regarding Kashmir, regarding the ongoing NRC process, and the general political climate in our country. These conversations have left a bitter taste in the mouth for me.

A lot of people - people who are generally nice, kind, and reasonable - are increasingly seeing gross violations of human right as acceptable in the ""interest of the nation."" Some things that would have been severely looked down upon if said 4-5 years ago are a part of casual conversations. Normal, well-educated people are now openly saying that it is okay to discriminate against people because of their religion. The more I think about it, the more depressed I feel about the state of things.

My question is this: how do we deal with this? This sudden shift in the general public conscience is not going to go away on its own. My personal experience has been that most attempts to counter this new line of reasoning only results in people getting defensive and deeper ingrained in their own prejudices. How do we counter this? How do we empathize with the position that these people are coming from and make them see that there is an alternative way of seeing things?",the_S1lence," It's good that you think over these situations. Let me tell you this, it isn't new. These feelings were always there. Communalism of this kind always persisted pre independence and post independence as well. It is now in the open partly because of the information age. Growing up we are all taught this ""oh they are not like us, they are different people with different set of values"". When such thoughts are ingrained in our upbringing how do you expect habits to change by any amount of argument. These sentiments have now got a voice with political representation. Infact at many places this is the acceptable line of thought.
I come from a place where i grew up among the elite sections of the society. My father was always introduced as ""aree ye un musalmano jaise nahi hai"". I always thought this was an acceptable line of thought. Now when i look back and think over it, i have just respect for my father. He heard it all, accepted it all just so that we get accepted by the society even though we had a different set of identity.
Is this India of my dreams? My Incredible India is lost somewhere... my hindu friend is very vocal about how entirely incompetent our current government is. she regularly puts up stories criticising the failures of government. when she put up the stories about kashmir, though, all hell broke loose. so many people of her own family berated her. her ""friend"" said that 'you shouldn't criticise modiji, i agree that hindus are benefiting but don't criticise him'. just typing this out makes me feel physically sick. how can people be so blindly trusting of a man who time and again has fucked over the economy is simply baffling to me. at this point, i really do wish i could somehow leave india. i cannot bear to stay here any longer. The only way I see it is if the opposition gets stronger, more organised and starts speaking up for real issues or if people decide to start a revolution against the corruption that is so inbred at all levels of politics and governance. It did not shift suddenly, it's just that we hear a lot of them more thanks to technology. The situation seems to be actually improving albeit very slowly. Its not growing.  Believe it or not, its decreasing.  People everywhere are more secular, more accepting, and as they become more educated and exposed to information, the trend will only accelerate.

Consider the people on reddit, for instance.  The majority are liberal.  More importantly,  even the ones who come in bigoted often quickly see the other side and change their views.

People have been killing each other in the name of religion for centuries in India.  They have treated each other badly.  Muslims and Hindus have been at each other's throats for 500 years, as have Hindus and Christians.  It wasn't too long ago that we had the holocaust called the partition.

What is happening is that thanks to all the free flow of information, increasingly acts of stupidity are being noted, reported on and, made public.  You get to hear more of them than in the past. These will give joy to a small number of bad people, but a greater number will be repelled and not want to be associated with it.

We do have a local uptick of bigotry, thanks to Modi and his bhakts, but Im convinced this is a short-lived bump. No trend in history is monotonic, and these people will likely *accelerate* the trend to liberalism.
The hindutavadis of India have made my ultra-religious bigoted parents start to change their views -- in their 70s.  They don't want to be associated with the hate.  They haven't gotten as far as I'd like them to be, but 10 years ago a muslim or christian wouldn't be allowed in their kitchen or puja room;  now the muslim driver they've ""adopted"" spends his time there. Youre not to be afforded any protection just because you belong to a particular religion is all i take it to mean.

Fun fact. Human rights dont exist. You get to have what others are willing to give you. Follow what society prescribes, modulate according to inner moralities, keep calm and carry on. You can't. It's too late. The government is fascist and can't take any criticism. It's not a democracy anymore. I feel bad for you Muslims in India. There's honestly no place for you in that country, and if you think there is then you're just kidding yourself. This entire Hindu supremacist movement that Modi has ignited will not go away any time soon; in fact, what you're seeing right now is the growth of it. The true sentiments of the Hindu population is starting to arise because they feel more comfortable than ever before to voice their hatred. Similar to how white supremacists view Trump. I mean, they call it HINDUstan for a reason. As long as your allegiance lies with new Delhi, do fuckall.",2019-09-02 19:23:43
Politics,Gandhi family skips Pranab Mukherjee's Bharat Ratna award function.,200,cnxuh9,https://www.aninews.in/news/national/general-news/gandhi-family-skips-pranab-mukherjees-bharat-ratna-award-function20190808230140/,73,,Kishor_Sonawane," This is the reason Modi won.  First, sidelining a prominent leader and making him president and now skipping his Bharat Ratna ceremony.

Why would a person join Congress when he sees how non-gandhi members are treated??  Like there's no scope of becoming the prime minister or even the president of INC unless you worship the Gandhi family.

At the time when this country needs a strong opposition, we're stuck with this sham of a party and people like Rahul Gandhi who are so cutoff from the people of the nation that it's not even funny. Oh well. They treat anyone non-Gandhi like trash and then expect to win. That‚Äôs hypocritical [deleted] Congress will perish. They are doomed. The worst thing is no other regional party seems to take congress' place, we need someone competing with BJP. It's disgusting how Congress treats some of their great party workers as a Trash just because they're not ""gandhis"". They are upset that Pranab got the Bharat Ratna before Rahul Time for Congress to Die... really need better alternative. INC leaders should leave behind this petty politics and show some respect to their former members instead of worshipping Gandhis. Since those seats were empty, they could have invited me.
The lunch/dinner was AWESOME! Pranab da should've been the PM. Things like this don‚Äôt bring them any favors. When they need those favors, badly. 

Even though I don‚Äôt think Pranabda deserves Bharat Ratna because what both his terms as FM were worst economic periods for India. 

And also disagree with Bharat Ratna for Nanaji Deshmukh. Well With this type of attitude i don't congress will come into power I think it is humiliating, mainly for Nehru family but slightly for Pranab Mukharjee too. But is it as simple as 'Congress hates non- Gandhi leaders '? Pranab Mukharjee was giving subtle support for BJP since a few years. He even went to RSS headquarters and gave a speech. Civil War inside Congress Party Last year he praised RSS that explains why he got Bharat Ratan and I don't see anything he has contributed to India that can be praised at International community. Pranab is a great politician and he really deserve Bharat Ratna! The Bharat Ratna has turned into an overtly political award anyway. Doesn't mean shit. Mummyyyyy mujhe nahi jaaaanaaa!!! üò≠ He is an RSS pawn now openly, no need to give him any more dignity. Man at the end he goes on to handshake all the BJP members only. And all of the 3 that get award he is the only one who goes on to shake hand. So it's pretty clear which side he is on now. And As if yashwant Shina was given respect by BJP after he left. Good.

This is funny as the ""rebellion"" is against the ""old guard"" of the Congress. As is the democratic Congress culture, they are playing politics to assert their own place in the party. The author tries to paint it as a rebellion against the Gandhi family when the real truth is that they have the tacit support of Rahul Gandhi in this. > These young leaders chose to go public with their dissent against the party line on Article 370 ...

The official party line is that they support the eventual repeal of Article 370 but do not support the undemocratic and unconstitutional way the current government has done it. So support for repealing Article 370 by any Congress leader is just a reiteration of the party stand and is not some ""rebellion"" against the party or the leadership. > Deora, claim Maharashtra Congress leaders, has been ‚Äúin touch‚Äù with the BJP and is preparing to jump ship. He didn‚Äôt respond to calls and text messages from ThePrint about these claims.

Rumour mongering. Thewebdev baksh de mujhe > According to experts, the inability of leaders to see a politically viable future for themselves in the party coupled with the leadership crisis since Rahul‚Äôs resignation has encouraged them to speak their minds.

This I agree with. Rahul Gandhi's resignation and the inability of the Congress leadership to address this effectively certainly has created a perception of leadership vacuum and caused morale to fall. However, they still believe only in the Gandhis to deliver on this too. First when the Gandhis were in absolute control, people had problem. Now they're losing control, people have problem. Gandhis kare to kare kya? > Scindia and Pilot have been sulking since they were denied chief ministership of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan last December.

I am sure they were disappointed. But again, they have no plans to leave the Congress for it and are being quite active rather than ""sulking"".

> Pilot recently hit out at Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot‚Äôs failure to prevent the closure of the Pehlu Khan case, where the accused were acquitted. 

Again, normal congress politics at work. There are many in the Congress who thinks this sensitive matter was not paid due attention by the government.

> Scindia‚Äôs supporters in the party have been attacking Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath and senior leader Digvijaya Singh and have even threatened to resign if the party‚Äôs reins are not handed over to the former Guna MP.

Again, normal Congress politics at work. **The author mistakes democratic dissent as a ""rebellion"".** > Five Congress MLAs in Maharashtra have already resigned from the party and over half-a-dozen more are negotiating with the BJP, a senior state Congress functionary told ThePrint ... There are similar reports from the other poll-bound states of Jharkhand and Haryana 

Nothing new here. Before any election, BJP under Amit Shah is known to open its coffers and / or use state agencies to entice opposition party leaders to join it. > 10, Janpath, Sonia Gandhi‚Äôs residence, used to be the first port of call for any party chief minister visiting Delhi. One of them recently spent a couple of days in the national capital but left without even seeking an appointment with her, confided a Congress leader, blaming it on Rahul‚Äôs ‚Äúcondescending behaviour‚Äù with his party colleagues.

Disgruntled congress worker who didn't get an appointment to meet Sonia Gandhi blames Rahul Gandhi for it. Obviously that happens a lot as the party President cannot meet everyone who desires to meet him / her and sometimes deliberately doesn't to send a message. > When Rahul Gandhi, the former party president who is likely to return to the helm sooner rather than later, was at the receiving end of the BJP for questioning normalcy in Kashmir, which Pakistan used in its petition to the United Nations, few party colleagues came out to endorse his stand.

An outright lie - even Shashi Tharoor has made a public statement endorsing Rahul Gandhi's statement and supporting him. > After Rahul offered his resignation at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, party leaders remained silent for a day, until social media was abuzz with talk of everyone in the Congress wanting him to go. 

Again, just a lie. > Prasada has been repeatedly contradicting the party line, first supporting the NDA government on its Article 370 move and then echoing Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs suggestion for population control. 

The official party line is that they support the eventual repeal of 370. The Congress also support population control. So these are not really an endorsement for Modi *kaka* but a reiteration of the party line. Nor does it indicate any ""rebellion"". > Kidwai has a different take again. ***‚ÄúI think it is because of Sonia Gandhi that the party has been able to hold it together. Despite talk about many leaders quitting the party, we haven‚Äôt seen a single leader exit since she took over,‚Äù*** he said.

> ... Sonia‚Äôs presence has quelled the dissatisfaction of the leaders, said Kidwai, as they felt they would at least get a patient hearing. ***‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fashionable to criticise the Gandhis,‚Äù*** Kidwai said. ‚ÄúBut the party needs to introspect and look within, many of its leaders haven‚Äôt risen to the occasion when needed.‚Äù

This shows how politically illiterate these people are and are just in for their personal benefits and dont give a fuck about the people or the nation. If the opposition were actually serious to start a movement against this public murder of democracy by the power-that-be, they'd use this as an opportunity to identify the saboteurs and ban them from the party once and for all.

With each of these defectors joining the BJP, my respect for the opposition grows; those who still choose to stay are actually committed to their core values and believe in it even if the world goes crazy over dictators.

Edit: my first silver! Thank you my good sir! For those of you unaware about what‚Äôs going on. It‚Äôs a festival celebrated around Telangana & Andhra Pradesh(?) and named as ‚ÄúBonalu‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs an interesting story behind its celebration and related to pre-colonial era of long-stretched famines and droughts in the Deccan region. I wish I could tell you more but I‚Äôm not a native and know about it only from friends and experience living in Hyderabad for the past 7 years. 

If you know more about it, definitely enlighten me. I would be glad. Bonalu is a Hindu Festival where Goddess Mahakali is worshiped. It is an annual festival celebrated in the twin Cities Hyderabad and Secunderabad and other parts of Telangana state, India.

Bonalu is celebrated usually during Ashada Masam that falls in July/August. Special poojas are performed for goddess Yellamma during the first and last day of the festival. The festival is considered as a form of thanksgiving to the Goddess after the fulfillment of vows. Bonam literally means Meal in Telugu, which is an offering to the Mother Goddess. Women folk in household prepare rice that is cooked along with Milk, Jaggery in a New Earthen or Brass Pot, which is adorned with Neem Leaves, Turmeric and Vermilion. Women carry these pots on their heads and make an offering of Bonam, including Bangles and Saree to the Mother Goddess at Temples. Bonalu involves worship of Kali in her various forms such Mysamma, Pochamma, Yellamma, Dokkalamma, Pedamma, Poleramma, Ankalamma, Maremma, Nookalamma etc.

Bonalu festival -Origin¬†
The festival history reportedly started in 1813 in the region of Hyderabad & Secunderabad when plague disease had broken out in Twin Cities that had claimed thousands of lives. A military battalion from Hyderabad was then deployed to Ujjain and concerned about the plague menace in Hyderabad the military battalion offered prayers to Mother Goddess at Mahankaali Temple in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh, that if people get relived from the epidemic they would be installing the idol of Mahankaali back in Secunderabad. It is believed by devotees that Mahankaali halted the spread of the disease while the Military Battalion came back here & installed an idol by offering Bonalu to Mother Mahankaali.

**The Ritual**¬†
Bonalu is celebrated across various parts of the city. During the first Sunday of Aashaadam, celebrations begin at Golconda Fort followed by Ujjaini Mahakali Temple in Secunderabad and Balkampet Yellamma temple in Balkampet on second Sunday, and the third Sunday, at the Pochamma and Katta maisamma temple near Chilkalguda and the Matheswari temple of Lal Darwaza in Old City of Hyderabad. Other temples such as Akkanna Madanna temple in Haribowli, Muthyalamma temple in Shah Ali Banda are the popular venues where Bonalu is celebrated. Lakhs of devotees throng the temples to pay obeisance to Mahankaali.¬†

Women dress up in the traditional Sari along with jewels and other accessories during the occasion. Teenage Girls adorn Half-Sarees along with jewels to reflect the traditional grace of the attire. Some women face a spell of trace where they dance with the balancing pots to the rhythmic beats made by drums in honor of the Goddess.¬†

The festival begins at Golconda, Women who carry Bonalu are believed to possessing the spirit of Mother Goddess, and when they approach temple, people sprinkle water on their feet in order to pacify the spirit, which is believed to be aggressive. Devotees offer Thottelu. These are small, colorful paper structures, which are supported by sticks and offered as a token of respect.

**Pothuraju**¬†
Pothuraju, considered the brother of Mother Goddess, is represented by a bare-bodied and well-built man, who wears a small tightly draped red dhoti and bells near ankles, and applies turmeric on his body, including vermilion on his forehead. Pothuraju dances to the resounding drums and dances close to Palaharam Bandi, the procession.

**The Feast**¬†
Bonalu is a festival where there is a divine offering to Mother Goddess and families also share these offerings with other family members and guests.

**Rangam**¬†
Rangam, or the Performing the Oracle, is held after the next morning of the actual festival. A Woman invokes goddess Mahankaali onto herself and performs this custom. She foretells the next year ahead when devotees ask for information about future.

**Ghatam**¬†
Ghatam implies a copper pot, which is decorated in the form of mother goddess and carried by a priest, adorning a traditional dhoti and his body completely smeared in turmeric. The Ghatam is taken as a procession from first day of the festival to the last day, when it is immersed in water. The Ghatam accompanies drums.¬†

Usually Ghatam of Akkanna Madanna Temple in Haribowli actually leads the procession, placed on an elephant inturn accompanied by mounted horses and models, which depict Akkanna and Madanna. It ends as a glittering procession in the evening after immersion of Ghatams at Nayapul. Ghatams from other popular temples of Mahakali in twin cities congregate here.

An experience of a lifetime. the guy instantly changes his expression once he knew he was caught video taping. This how life hits me vs how I reactü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è History behind bonalu festival (from wikipedia)

>The history of the origin of this festival traces back to the 18th Century, and is linked with the ""Regimental Bazaar"" and the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. In the year 1813, plague disease broke out in the twin cities, and this took away the lives of thousands of people. Just before this, a military battalion from Hyderabad was deployed to Ujjain. When this Hyderabadian Military Battalion got to know about the epidemic in the cities, they prayed to the Mother Goddess in Mahankaal Temple -¬†Ujjain,¬†Madhya Pradesh. History tells us, that this military battalion prayed to Goddess Mahankaali, to kill the plague, and if the Goddess would do so, they had decided to install an idol of the Goddess Mahankaali in the city. It is believed that Mahankaali destroyed the disease and kept the pestilence away. Then, the military battalion returned to the city and installed an idol of the goddess, which was followed by the offering of¬†Bonalu¬†to her. Hence, from then, this became a tradition, which has been followed and is still being followed by most of the people of¬†Telangana.

>Other versions also include the mythological story and belief that revolves around the festival, says that this is the time when Goddess Mahakali comes back to her parental home, in Ashada Maasam or the period from late June to August, and so, this period is the most optimal time to offer¬†Bonalu¬†to the goddess. This can be compared to the treatment of a girl, who is married, and then returns to her birthplace, and is pampered by her parents.

The person you see in the video is dressed up as pothuraaju. Pothuraaju is also a god and is the only brother of 10 (?) sister-goddesses. He usually carries this huge whip and it is actually considered as a blessing if you are hit with it. But usually they hit only lightly as a formality.

Does individual channel cost of a-la-carte varies with operator.? 

Ex. lets say  some xyz channel cost is set at M.R.P Rs. 15.

Weather this cost is same across all dth  service providers  like TATA Sky, Airtel, Videocon etc., or the service provider set their own discount price to attract customer like  Airtel - Rs. 10, Tata - Rs. 12, Videocon - Rs.15.

If price differs with operator then, which DTH operator has the cheapest a-la-carte channel? Leading a branch team in the college I studied was and unfortunately remains a stressful thing.

The so-called ‚Äúpugmark census‚Äù unrealistically hoped to identify every wild tiger from its paw-prints.
> 
> That tiger census approach, which was demonstrated to be flawed by conservation scientists, suggested that tiger numbers grew to more than 4,000 by 2004. But in the following year, after two high-profile reserves claiming large tiger populations were exposed to have none at all, the pugmark census was discredited and discarded. Government officials suddenly denounced their own approach as ‚Äútrash,‚Äù then unaccountably turned to an obsolete statistical method revived from the 1930s.
> 
> Since then, three ‚Äònational tiger estimation‚Äô surveys have been completed (in 2006, 2010, and 2014). Each involved 90,000 man-days of labour spread over 400,000 sq km of forests and at a cost of 120m rupees (¬£1.2m) to Indian taxpayers. Armies of poorly trained foot soldiers collected a bewildering array of data, including tiger photos from automated camera traps, as well as counts of tiger tracks and droppings.
> 
> The massive piles of data were then crunched through a creaky statistical model incapable of separating the ‚Äòsignal‚Äô from the ‚Äònoise.‚Äô These analyses, conducted under great secrecy, have generated the government‚Äôs tiger numbers. Not available for independent replication, India‚Äôs tiger data appears to be more elusive than the cat itself.

Politics,What can we do? What should a common man do?,162,chylty,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/chylty/what_can_we_do_what_should_a_common_man_do/,91,"With all the dangerous bills being passed (Undermining RTI, Ability to name an individual as terrorist, UP Private universities being restricted from holding ""anti-national"" activities and likely many more in the pipeline) and with all stupid shit that is being propogated (Go to moon if you are against 'Jai Shri Ram', Astrology is the best science of the world, Peacock reproduces with tears, There was internet during Mahabharat, There was plastic surgery, Gravitational waves should be called Modi waves and of course many many more), what can a common man do?

Ranting on twitter/reddit/facebook doesn't seem to do anything. In my opinion, violent protests on streets is not an option. For some reason, voting is not being used as a weapon against this. Considering the fact that all the youth is busy in 9-5 jobs, cricket, bollywood, big boss, what do you think is the best way to act?

Surely, there is a need for a revolution. With BJP in majority in Lok Sabha and to be majority in Rajya Sabha, congress in disarray, opposition is virtually non-existent. Media doesn't do shit. 

We need to start a revolution, but what, how, when and where!!?",a_bunch_of_neurons," Isn't it weird that Hong Kong people - despite being only 7 million strong, despite staring at an inevitable future inside an oppressive wealthy powerful giant,  despite having no prominent leadership or opposition party - still turned out in such numbers with so much determination for so long, sacrificing their normal lives and comforts. And all that for just one law that doesn't even affect most of them.

In contrast, India's institutions and laws that directly benefit citizens are falling like bowling pins one after another, but there hasn't been even one civil society protest. Civil society and civil society leadership seem nonexistent in India. A few groups are fighting via the courts, but for some strange reason, they never seem to approach people for moral or financial support. I wonder what the emergency might have felt like... I say, we keeping fighting. We must challenge, question and criticize the government on all platforms online and offline but in a manner that doesn't endanger our personal safety. It's a difficult and thankless job but I think eventually we will win. We won't be able to build a secular society in a day and it is natural to face opposition along the way. So don't lose hope, and keep fighting the good fight. Resist and keep up our narrative alive. They will get their way because they have the numbers. But as long as we keep speaking, we are doing our job. 

Is it enough? No. But we aren't capable of doing what is enough right now. Every nation has this boom-bust cycle even in social ideology. Imagine being born in Europe in the 1890s decade. First world war when you are 20, second one when you're 40, and if you survived, living on aid from US and UK till you die. All because the right wing extremism saw its flow. 

So, we resist and wait for this flow to end and ebb to begin. I'm optimistic that we'll see the light sooner or later. Before starting a revolution against the authoritarian government, we need to revolt against the regime which is established in our own households.

The ideology to not question the higher authority and follow the orders is planted by our very own parents. Years of psychological suppression won't be so easy to overcome. I know many people who voted for BJP because their parents asked them to. I have had countless arguments with my relatives on their extremist hindu ideology but every argument ends with my parents telling me to be respectful towards my elders.

""Let us never forget that government is ourselves and not an alien power over us. The ultimate rulers of our democracy are not a President and senators and congressmen and government officials, but the voters of this country."" 
-Franklin D. Roosevelt It's just going to be worse. In next election whether it is state / central or municipal election throw them out. 1. Change your name legally to Sharma Mishra or   Joshi Pandey or similar.
2. Do not marry or have kids so you dont have to see loved ones suffer.
3. Change your phone number every 6 months.
4. Dont stay in one job or one rented place for more than a year.
5. Take a vacation every year to the same foreign spot - be it nepal or malaysia or australia. Build connections.
6. Apply for emigration to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and USA.
7. Invest only in foreign assets either through mutual funds, NASDAQ ETF or via opening a foreign bank account and investing through it.
8. As soon as you can, buy some property abroad ..be it nepal or USA. 
9. Dont read news, worry about politics or others. Keep your head down but discriminate against bhakts and help the underprivileged, by donating, hiring or giving them your business.
10. Find the smallest unit of politics around you... and get involved ...local club or local walking group etc.
11. Dont drink, smoke, gamble etc...save your money and work hard....two jobs if need be.... in 10 yrs you will have enough to leave this country. Most realistic answer after emigration: Start a business. Take risks, gather money, gain power and clout and start pushing against policies in industry forums and municipals. Let's mass emigrate out of this shit hole of a country. As an individual if we can change ourself maybe that's the revolution we need. That is the only option left  The plot of ""Watchdogs: Legion"" is starting to look very much a potential possibility. Recognize the importance of these rights and vote for the right people. But if people vote for Gautam Gambhir over Atishi or for Sunny fucking Deol then they have this coming to them. Emigrate(if you can) Change country tbh. BJP has united hindus. From dalits to obc to brahmins all vote for BJP as hindus.

Check this out I guess all one can do it continue to act in their personal capacity(without getting lynched) support similar voices wherever and whenever possible and hope for the collective effort to eventually reach a critical mass before the point of no-return. I'm afraid the common man that voted for hindutva fascism is not going to wake up until he himself is forced to face the music. The Central govt.wants to wash off its hands with as many social responsibilities as possible. Most of the elected people's representatives are not educationists/academicians/scientists or technocrats. Most of them are advocates, who doesn't understand about many sectors, including education.
Most of the state govt.s are run by persons to whom education has no value,as they themselves are not educated.
India doesn't have a civil society,as their probable members would be from the middle class - & they are totally careless about this aspect of an arm of Indian development. For them- education is not a priority.
That leaves the media. Again education alone can't be the bread & butter for media & most of them are privately run. So the lesser the educated, better will be their chances of business - as they can easily fool people.
That leaves the retired persons in the arena. If the learned takes up this cause, at least some salvaging can be done - other wise it's every one for himself. There are NGOs and people who are fighting. There are just levels of how you can help. You can either be the social worker who devotes his/her entire time (e.g. Narendra Dabolkar) to fight the system; or you decide your job is in the area where you want to make a difference ( e.g. education, defense, lawyer, IPS, IAS, IFS, politician) OR you contact an NGO and take up a cause ( even if it is just one court case) and help in your free time. It can be overwhelming to look at the big picture, but if you want to contribute, it must be one tiny action at a time. You can do it, we just need to focus on one action that we feel passionate about. e.g. I feel passionate about education policy, so I will look for organizations/people that are doing good and see what I can do to help. Or, I am angry with corrupt politicians taking over forest land -> look for organizations who have filed court cases against them. Believe me, there are many. We just need to make the effort and look. I believe that this is the only way, rather than mobilizing the masses against someone that the majority voted for. Am I the only one who is thinking of becoming a full stack web dev to go abroad even when I have no experience and interest in Maths, Data Structures and Engineering? be like ambani .

before bjp came , everybody was claiming him to be congress guy , but after bjp hes the biggest gainer from bjp.

see how you can game the system Focus on police reforms and judicial reforms, RTI is for big people like journalists and often the data received from RTI   is used for sensationalism..   


If you have want a safe and secure society, police reforms will pave the way. Good luck. AI was hidden in mantras bro how could you forget that? Start a personal revolution. Make friends and become powerful. Not in a thug like manner. Learn to change your environment with the small things first. The things that are in your control. Improve your condition bit by bit but consistently. Revolution doesn't make sense unless you want to overthrow democratically elected government ? Is that what you want to do.

Best way is to politely educate people on why you think India deserves different leader. You need to be vocal about sensible issues like government raising taxes and causing panic among FPI and shut up about idiotic comments from Drump. That's what the anti-fascists are doing in the west. I don't see a sudden revolution happening in our country. We should be ready for a long, slow and multilayered approach to bring about the changes in our society.

Despite the reprehensible ideology of RSS, one thing that I admire about them is their network of volunteers spreading their agenda of hatred so efficiently like viruses. Ultimately, this is an ideological war. If we want to win this war, we need to spread our ideology. Perhaps we need a grass-root movement, and perhaps we need to replicate this concept of morning meetings in 'Shakhas', where we can educate youths about the idea of a liberal and secular India.

Also, we urgently need judicial and police reforms. Rich and connected today can flout all the laws without any consequences. Crores of cases are pending. Often it takes decades, for a judgement to be delivered. Litigants often die before judgements are pronounced in their cases. Unfortunately, these important points are not election issues. If elections can be won in the name of religion, caste arithmetic and pseudo-nationalism, then why will our political class ever bother to tackle these pressing issues. We need a revolution without it India will only get worse there is no doubt about it. Everyone said after BJP won that their biggest upper hand was of their grip over social media so imo we should focus on social media as everyone is there even old generation on fb..

&#x200B;

to change people mind the best option is to show them an alternative because without that people will say if not modi then who, and imo if we look at political parties the best alternative is APP as that party was made after a revolt and most people in delhi are also happy with their work. if we look at lalu, mamta, mayawati etc etc i dont think they are a better alternative

&#x200B;

so to make a change we can target where most people are there like facebook or twitter and make some pages which shows what are fake news and people in that group should target other groups 

to change people minds we have to talk in a certain way that will make them realize what is happening

to target other groups make post about comparison between alternative govt. and current govt. , and what developed countries provide like sweden and what modi does, basically comparison about positive things and modi

and make memes and videos of modi's previous promices and now,

find a nickname for the current government for making fun and critizing them,

share links in their groups critizing the govt. and people from our group should upvote it to make it seen,

&#x200B;

to sum it up we should critize the government in a way which makes people realize what is happening (on major issues which they cant ignore) and should do this in groups (giving each other upvotes so the post does not die) and if you find ideas share everywhere you can...

They end up making me upset and depressed about the political landscape of this country. 

Maybe I'm just another liberal snowflake, but following the news is getting too hard for me. I lose it especially when people start justifying human rights abuse or lynchings. And these hate comments about Mahatma Gandhi have gone up lately on Twitter and Instagram.

Should I just stop consuming political news and videos all together? Can't see any other way to escape this noise. How do you guys manage to not get politically depressed?",Pink-Rose-Girl," Yes, if it is actually hurting your mental wellbeing, avoid news channels, and curate your sns withing an inch of its life. Go back to the old habit of reading newspapers, an actual paper one. That way your brain gets time to absorb the news in long format, you get time to form an opinion without being distacted by what others are saying. And you also get to read opeds and editorials along with other articles without the constant hum of kneejerk comments. Stay away from Twitter for a while. However this toxic environment should make you strong. You will feel low for sometime. However in the long run you would be a more determined person.
The world around us is not perfect, but it's not changed by ostrich who hide their heads in sand. We need to do our part to make it better if not perfect.
Also follow the mademesmile subreddit. It helps. Real time news is cancerous. Stop going to Twitter, YouTube, tv channels etc. Also, looking at other people's reactions influences your views and doesn't let you objectively process the news. 

I'm a big fan of newspapers for this reason. Since it's a one big summary of daily events, the articles are much more thought-out and the tone is to inform rather than instigate. Also there are no reactions from a million people to the event for you to process. It keeps you informed, let's you process the news and come to your own conclusion. 

A good opinion piece on NY times for it: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/technology/two-months-news-newspapers.html Media sells the content that gets your attention. Negative stories are better at it than positive stories.

Here's what I do:

1- I used to use [news.google.com](https://news.google.com) for news. But now I have blocked that site on the router. Political news absolutely generates anxiety.

2- I don't use twitter, facebook, instagram. Their only goal is to keep you online as long as they can. Pretty manipulative.

3- uninstall youtube app from mobile. Laptop is fine.

4- Maintain youtube feed. You have to make sure that you do not watch political crap on your main logged in account. Keep it pure; only use it to watch quality content related to your hobbies / interests or light non controversial youtubers. And tell youtube to not recommend news related stuff. And obviously unsubscribe from a channel which uploads that stuff.

5- If you sometime just want to watch political stuff, open that in private browsing. What this does is, your accounts don't get personalized by google, youtube. Otherwise you'll keep seeing same and same content. And you tend to click on that poisonous content because it confirms your world-view even more.

&#x200B;

At the end of the day. News is not a necessary thing to survive. My life would not change a bit if I had no idea what happened in Kashmir. Because it does not matter. You will still have to earn and make a living whether it is BJP or any other party. No one cares about depression in this country. That is the harsh truth. Nothing will change. Raise your voice. Find an outlet. Dont let it rot within you, speak it out or write it down. I've been trying to do the same. Will start a website/blog soon. Take a break from all political news and anything else that keeps to distracted, but makes you wonder what the hell just happened to your time. Do this for a couple of weeks minimum, I'd  suggest a month. 

May be try reading a fiction book (non-political) or spend time with any other hobby/interests you may have.

You'll be surprised by:

* how not being up to date with news has close to 0 impact in your life
* how much you enjoy other activities/hobbies
* how you can actually change the world by talking to people instead of just reading opinions online which does nothing


Once your break is done and your ready to go back, start with newspapers then may be a news app like livemint or indianexpress.com or whatever you prefer. Do not use social media as a source of news. Do not use news aggregators like inshorts, Google news. **Ignorance is Bliss -** Me(6th Sep,2019) Maybe try to get a mental health checkup done if YouTube comments rile you up to the point of depression lmao",2019-09-06 01:50:27

On further inspection this was found to be a group of BJP supporters. So Rahul Gandhi gave his resignation to Rahul Gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul Gandhi because Rahul Gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul Gandhi. Sonia Gandhi rejects his decision. Enough with this nautanki. [UPDATE : Sonia Gandhi rejects resignation offer.](https://www.news18.com/amp/news/politics/rahul-gandhi-offers-to-resign-as-congress-president-after-another-rout-sonia-gandhi-says-no-2157043.html) If I were Raga, I would not offer, I will resign with immediate effect. Go back to Amethi and stay there till UP elections. Build cadre there and ensure Congress's win in at least 10 assembly constituencies around Amethi and build some self respect. 

Stop spreading these news through source to gain sympathy for your bootlickers to say ""no no please don't"" 
Honestly, he should resign. 

INC is in need of a new face, a leader who can stand up to the likes of Modi and Shah which is an extremely challenging task in itself, RaGa just isn‚Äôt capable of doing that. 

I don‚Äôt like Modi, but I don‚Äôt hate him either. He projected himself not only as a politician, but as a genuine leader... 

I feel quite sad for RaGa today, but the reality is, he just doesn‚Äôt have what it takes to be a politician..

*Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be. The measure of a person, is how well they succeed at being who they are.* I think the only way INC‚Äôs dynastic hegemony will end is if they suffer successive defeats in the elections reducing their relevance. They did not learn from 2014 mandate and they will not learn from 2019. 

It is ridiculous that a pan india party wins seats less than local parties. 

I think we will see more of the MGB style alliances forming to be a viable opposition front rather than a strong single pan india opposition party which is not optimal because you have ragtag mix of local parties without a uniform agenda that can potentially take on power at center. At this point anyone who wants RaGa to stay as head of congress is actually bjp supporters..

Seriously though modi have some much to thank him. Because of RaGa today NDA have the biggest mandate since 1984!!! 

How can anyone screw this badly is beyond me..any common rickshaw driver might actually be better politician than RaGa CWC won‚Äôt accept it . Mummy ko resignation dega kya Forget offering to resign. He should just do it. He has offered in the past too. It's high time the Gandhi family learn their lesson. What's the minimum number of seats to be leader of opposition? Is RaGa at least getting that? /s Can't get over these incompetent fucks who can't pose a fucking challenge to the incumbent government. We deserve a better opposition than these one-family ass licking politicians. He hasn't offered anything. He has immediately started working on helping BJP win in 2024

First party president who helped opposition party win twice!! Here's a conspiracy theory: Rahul Gandhi is a BJP implant to destroy Congress from within. üòÜ Fun Fact: If you catch a train from Churchgate(Mumbai) station and travel towards North. The first Congress MP you will find is in Punjab. It was rejected by Sonia gandhi DO IT. PLEASE. I BEG YOU. It‚Äôs about time He was the media's darling Prince ready to take the throne of the Prime Minister's office a decade ago. It's funny how the Congress and its media machine projects him as PM material when he's not had to work an honest day's work his whole life and has no street smarts or book smarts whatsoever. Drama What on earth is *offering* to the resign? Just do it, and take your entitled brat sister along with you. Rahul Gandhi to reject Rahul Gandhi's resignation. Offers!! this guy should retire and go abroad before he do anymore damage. High time. He needs to resign. And other leaders of congress should be demanding it by now. Please leave! Let someone competent take the helm. The ground that will be be disappointed by this the most is the BJP I'm not fully up to speed with Indian politics, however isn't it generally normal in democracies for a party leader to resign if he/she suffers a near electoral wipeout? Looking at Indian election results it looks like the Indian National Congress lost 79% of their 206 seats at the 2014 General Election, so how was it possible for Shree Rahul Gandhi to remain leader? You would surely think that the grassroots or the principal donors would effectively force the former leader out, right? Please get the message already!  
The people don't see RaGa as a potential PM, you've lost once, lost twice.  
Change the face of your party and please it not be a family INC will dissolve without a Gandhi. It is a fact. 

And also the current Gandhi will be it's downfall.

Either way INC is dead. After losing the elections, when you have the matters to fight elections which can lead to lose for BJP.

I think that RaGa should step down. This will send a positive message to the voters who have mindset of Nepotism & Congress. He should work in party but he should also give chance to new politicians Thing is, people are automatically attracted to strength, boldness and ferociousness in a leader, no matter what development he does/doesn't do.  
  
To defeat Modi, u need his equal in personality. RaGa may be a decent PM but he is a wet tissue in personality compared to Modi. If Rahul had any chance, Congress would have faired better

Please do your self a favour, retire and go live your life.  If Congress has no other leader to replace Rahul, then it should be doomed Congress is a franchise model political party, the Gandhi‚Äôs are the brand name and policy bearers of the company, the state leaders have their own company and supporters and use the franchise.

The Gandhi‚Äôs do not allow the franchisees to gain too much power, for example Rajasekar Reddy of AP who was very powerful and called the shots, Siddaramiah too is powerful.

So since the Gandhi‚Äôs have the brand and goodwill and it franchises it to a local leader in return for funds, power and cadre Human Resources.

Hence no Gandhi‚Äôs will relinquish their leadership position, and no franchisees will accept a no brand leader from top, and voters too will not vote for Congress unless it‚Äôs lead by Gandhi‚Äôs.

Hence the term greedy as a pig. In a scenario rahul might step down, he needs to make sure someone worthy gets the mantle. Otherwise the congress might just implode like what happened to the aiadmk in tamil nadu.

I really do hope he resigns from the top post. He did the best he can this time but the results hardly changed compared to last time. Radical changes are needed to change the fortunes of the congress party in 2024. It is extremely dangerous to let the BJP have absolute majority especially with modi-shah‚Äôs aggresive immoral tactics to stay in power. Same old modus operandi. Sigh. J U M L A Here is the same news from 2014: https://m.economictimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/sonia-gandhi-rahul-gandhi-offer-to-resign-from-congress-posts-after-defeat-party-refuses/articleshow/35348660.cms Why even offer,You are the leader.,just resign.Ye koi movie hein kya jo Saare congressi rote huey, per pakad ke bolege resign mat karo,Aap hi hamaari hope ho.Most of the senior leaders,who have themselves lost need to be ousted from leadership roles in congress. CWC may reject the offer , but honestly I think he should resign. No matter how much I like this guy sensiblity ,but leader like him dont work in India. India public like leaders who can make them feel like they're someone great and proud ( even if it's just false dream ) .Modi can do that, Rahul can't. INC need the same type of leader. Rahul wasn't bult for politics. He's a nice person I'm sure but he doesn't have the quick wits, or the farsight to be in politics. Should have done it 5 years ago, I'm not a BJP supporter and voting for a regional party is fucking pointless in national election and Congress gave absolutely no reason to vote for them As much as I admire him as a person, he's no match for Amit Shah. He should straight up quit the post instead of all this offering resignation crap. Haha, that snake will say anything, but never resign ### another PR stunt, he will submit they wont accept. Fuck with this all BS. Finally About time. Please do. Palpatine voice: Dewit! Okay whatever it is, what the f is that photo? Gandhi-mukt Congress? Might have a fighting chance next time around... Tomorrow, Rahul gandhi will give his resignation to Rahul gandhi which will be rejected by Rahul gandhi because Rahul gandhi says resignation is not a solution of problems created by Rahul gandhi.

Rahul Gandhi then will request Rahul Gandhi to continue to guide the Congress which Rahul Gandhi will accept and will thank Rahul Gandhi for reposing faith in Rahul Gandhi. Guys how long are we going to allow the media to control our conversations with their ""sources""? lol. WTF is this ‚Äòoffer‚Äô to resign?  Just resign and go away, because one has to search really hard to an equally ineffective leader. They wanted to win on an Anti-Modi sentiment but ironically lost to an Anti-Rahul mandate. If congress wants to survive it needs to leave the Gandhis alone and get more capable leaders on the front. And definitely stop this drama of getting sympathy for Rahul. Rahul go back I hope Shashi Tharoor becomes the new leader. Why offer? Just resign. If everyone in the country had 10 paise for every time this guy offered to resign, then there would be no need for the 15 lakhs in bank account. Just do it! -nike ""offers"" like he's doing a favor to the country. 

Let him be there. It could be a major turn in Indian politics where unaware people genuinely understand that family lineage doesn't deserve shit. Usual nautanki. He didn't had any remorse on his face. He and his sister were smiling like nothing happened. Ye Kam election se pahle karna cahiye tha, ab Kya fayda. It would be wrong to say that congress is any nationalists now.

Don't give me history of party ,just facts, you try to get voters and inititae himdu terro at the front to appease them, what morons do you  think indians are.

You contest a guy who was dancing with half naked girls against pragya, who was given clean chit by ec, you had lil knowledge of rafale, and sc gave clean chit to it,so you fund your party lawyers to reopen the case the goto ralies to and say, ""look ,sc opened the case once again, they might have found modi guilty"" 

Last but not least, you were having anti-india imgae when you questioned indian army .

You deserved it. I think it was just a PR move. Rahul Gandhi is critical for India's success. His presence keeps the deeply corrupt Congress away from power. It's high time now.congress needs to project someone who is strong and capable I am resigning,and I appoint didi or mummy as the new chief until we get some success then I will be back as chief again and will get lauded for revival of congress.And then again we will appoint a PM who has to toe the party lines, doesn't matter if he looks weak.

Then we will lose few elections,come back riding the anti incumbency wave and cycle will go on. Gandu going? Oh no! Yayyy!! He should resign without any nautanki and take her mother, sister and brother-in-law with him. Let Congress fall apart, and use it as an opportunity to make this party from ground up again. They have to stop applying bandaids to deep wounds.

Congress is doomed till this family is at helm. Rahul Gandhi has absolutely nothing to show for except big words. A borderline voter would never take chance with him, they would rather vote for a regional party than him.

I think Congress is important for India but not in present state and definitely not with Gandhi family in charge. We need a Congress party that's rooted in socially and economically progressive ideals, and have people that have made their way up top organically. Until then, he will have to keep giving such bogus resignations. I hope Congress doesn't take any hasty decisions. The Gandhi family is what is holding the party together. With that said I think Priyanka is a better fit to lead the party. I lost my 72000k He will offer it to the Congress committee. He is the President, but there is a committee of senior people such as Digvijay Singh, Shashi Tharoor, Ashok Gehlot, etc. who shall be consulted. There is a huge gap for a center right, unabashedly capitalist party that doesn't shy away from being seen as pro-Hindu in India.

For all practical purposes, BJP is silly socialist. Their fiscal agenda is no different from that of Congress. 

If the Congress can dump the Gandhis, move to the right, be secular (that doesn't mean pandering to the minorities and hosting Iftaar parties), they have a strong chance in 2024. I wonder when people in Congress realize that the Gandhi-Vadra complex is a massive liability for them. Offers! The entitled prince has ...OMG.... OFFERED!

Thank you prince .... thank you for your generous offer to resign. Hi, I am not an Indian but I trade Emerging market indices which got me interested in this elections. We view continuation of existing regimes as bullish. Most folks seem to be bullish that Modi will continue economic reforms, although the recent intervention in Central Banker RBI wasn't viewed favorably.

I am curious about the opposition party, which seems to be an arm of a single family since inception? Usually when you lose back to back elections, a rebel more extreme wing develops which tries to take control of the party (like how alt right took control of Republican Party through Trump, an outsider).

Is there any such group within Congress and what are the chances they can take control from existing group and attempt to win next elections (or midterms if such an event exists).

Thanks. Now I can live peacefully for another 5 years. Unless this nincompoop decides to run for the PMs post again. RaGa should dig in and hold his ground. He should choose a more prominent face like Tharoor or Chidambar as a PM candidate next time and retain his position as the party chief. Just like how Sonia did in UPA1/2. If a 4th standard pass guy can run this country.. really anyone can. Besides BJP knows how to win elections but to deliver concrete economic building measures is an all together different ball game. How long will they fudge data? This is the perfect time to start a change.org to have a likable figure like captain Amrinder or Tharoor as president of the party. Someone please do that. When I saw his speech conceding defeat, despite myself I felt bad for him. I think he knows he's not cut out for politics and wants out, and his offer to resign is genuine, but his family and party won't let him.

For what it's worth I think underneath all this he's someone who genuinely wants to do good even though his politics, policies and party are all wrong.

I wouldn't vote for him now, but given his (relative) youth he's likely to become PM some day, be it 2024 or 2029. And I think I'd be fine with that. I feel congress bartered its seats to save robert vadra and also 2 defamation cases filed on them by anil ambani and adani

How come just a day before anil ambani took the case back and today adani ? üòè He sounds like the Hillary Clinton of India To be honest, I for whatever reason want to see Rahul Gandhi at higher power (or maybe a PM one day) but for that to happen, he needs to get his shit together. He needs to actually work for this stuff (the same kind of activeness that was observed the past few months) consistently for the next 5 years.

Looks like the next elections will deliver a Congress mukt bharat. Wasn't the social media manager of Congress going to do 1 more ama after the results? Things opposition has to improve :

1. They need to get rid of nepotism, at least at the top. Most of parties in MGB are dynastic and have history of corruption. Do away with old guard and bring in some fresh blood and ideas. To do that these parties will have to adopt an internal constitution and processes to ensure rise of meritorious candidates. Currently, it seems impossible. 

 

2. Embrace true secularism i.e. stop pandering to a community for votebank. Support secular Uniform civil code and be adamant at separation of governance and religion.  

 

3. Do good work at the states where they are in power. Stop fighting elections on the failures of Modi, fight elections on your merits. 
 


4. Opposition also needs to identify the rotten apples and distance itself from them. Mamata has shown dictatorial tendencies and her party is famed for its use of violence. No need to establish ties with her. She will bring you down with her. Enemy of enemy is my friend doesn't apply in politics. Aligning with someone who has contrasting vision and aspirations sends mixed signals to the voter. 


5. Have a vision paper based on development, progress, true secularism, equality , national security and climate. Fighting elections purely on caste equations and quota promises will only get this far. Room for Caste politics is diminishing and in next 20 years, may start to become irrelevant. 


I can see opposition embracing 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, therefore the opposition loses might keep on piling.


Edit : Added point 5


Edit 2: I voted for BJP because to me the alternative was a coalition of dynastic regional parties with history of corruption such as RJD, SP, BSP, DMK, CBN's party, TMC and that would have been catastrophic for our nation. 

If political parties implement the amendments that I have stated, then we have an excellent opportunity to elevate the political discourse and improve the governance. I don't favour any party. But this is bad for India, not because BJP got elected. But because there is a non-existent opposition party. Too much power at one party didn't always bode well for India.


One good thing about this election: dynasty politics getting obliterated.  \-Narendra Modi finishes thanking supporters and world leaders.

Copypasta from Insta, found it funny so..... Rahul's resignation rejected.

Well, fuck. I believe Congress, SP, BSP etc all need fresh faces at the top. Rahul and Akhilesh bhaiyya are memes. Notice how the final results are yet to be formally declared - as of 12pm , 24th May. This is because of verifying of VVPAT slips from 5 random EVMs from each constituency. No reports of any discrepancy yet. I hope this ends the EVM discussion. Why BJP Won:   
(Numbers from BJP President's press conference)

\- 3 Years of preparation (From January 2016)  
\- 3000 full time on ground workers focusing on Lok Sabha & Vidhan Sabha constituencies for the last two years  
\- 18 National level committees headed by senior ministers  
\- 29 State level committees involving 435 senior leaders.  
\- 482 Constituency level committees having 7,230 karyakartas in positions of responsibility

Ideology is important.   
Social media reach is important.   
Arguments and rants are important.   
But nothing can substitute the impact of pure hard work done meticulously. I have a question. Why do people of Punjab vote for Congress and not BJP unlike other North Indian states? One thing is clear from the comments in this post: quite a few people misinterpret democracy as ""whatever I think good"" and intelligence as ""agreeing with me"". Daenerys Targaryens are abundant. I dont wana jump anybody. Just curious.

Rajasthan has ruling party Congress, still how did they not win even one seat?? This is the best result that could have happened. UPA sucks real bad, plus they don't bring anything to the table. Voting for UPA  just means voting for one family with only a vision to get re elected, nothing for the nation. The congress should ditch the Gandhis if it wants to have any future. My generation has no place in our hearts for them quite simply.  

As for a strong opposition,  AAP made that space, credible with decent faces and leaders. If Kejriwal had not made stopping the BJP his only agenda and concentrated on expanding only his party, probably made a 20 year roadmap, We could have a good left face to BJPs right. A two party system which would have the complete range of ideological offerings. Non-Indian leftist here, I heard from a friend that a big part of Modi's win was his successful electrification/running water projects in poorer areas, which made up for the weaker macroeconomic factors. How much truth is there to this? I am kind of surprised that why some people (read opposition) was not able to gauge the scale of the expected win.I mean Modi may not be an autocrat but he seems to get some shit done. Ujjwala Yojna ,Mudra Yojna and PM-KISAN were delivered to people in much more efficient way than the past precedence. In India, people want to give second chance to the one who seems to do things. [removed] [**Not more than 250 for NDA, was my secret wish: Jagan**](https://www.deccanherald.com/national/national-politics/not-more-than-250-for-nda-was-my-secret-wish-jagan-736218.html)

Lol. I like that he's so open about it. I suspect there were several other regional leaders that were hoping for a similar outcome for an entry into the NDA. KCR, Naveen Patnaik, maybe even MK Stalin and Mayawati.  PM-Kisan for farmers and Ujjwala scheme  were two main schemes which created a strong under current for BJP even in those states which the party recently lost and also Ayushman bharat is also popular among lower income group people ,Modi not only able to kick off these schemes but also able to take them to people directly  like in our house maid was happy and in village women were happy by getting gas cylinders instead of daily cow-dung cakes process.Same goes with PM-Kisan farmers received their 1st installment directly in their accounts before elections. This is what happens when you have no credible opposition and a bunch of corrupt to the core and greedy regional parties. Hoping for Piyush Goyal as Finance Minister Congress gained at the expense of non-aligned forces. So, the *mahagathbandhan* was a massive failure. NDA has one seat less as compared to 2014. BJP won 303 seats this time. What was their tally in 2014? Was it 336 or 352 in 2014 ? I think Ayushman Bharat pushed a lot of votes in Tier-II and Tier-III cities towards BJP. Any opinions ? Only person who could have taken on Modi was probably Amarinder Singh. 

You want to use nationalism? Well, Amarinder served in the armed forces. 

You want use the Sikh killings? Amarinder is a sikh. 

You want to use Modi's experience? Well, Amarinder is a CM of a border state. 

But ofcourse, the Gandhis would rather keep power to themselves than do something good for the party. According to India Today - Axis:

&#x200B;

The most important issue for people when deciding who to vote for was 

&#x200B;

Unemployment (33%)

&#x200B;

National Security was at 9%. 

&#x200B;

I think this is should be a clear message to to INC that people just don't see Rahul Gandhi as a capable leader who can solve India's problems. [removed] BTW it looks like the NDA will finally get a majority in the Rajya Sabha by 2020.

Aside from overblown fears about Emergency and changing the Constitution, it'll enable them to pass long-stalled bills like the Land Acquisition Reforms and Triple Talaq Bill. If you consider politicians as entrepreneurs like I do , we can see that BJP is a party (organisation) of first generation entrepreneurs who got their big break (funding) during the Emergency or the Ram Mandir movement. 

While the opposition seems like a tepid slow organisation of third , fourth or in case of the congress, fifth generation entrepreneurs. This manifests in the energy levels we see in the two organisations. While one is all about hustling and getting things done (some of which may be wrong), the second is plagued with unnecessary overhead costs that have no marginal utility whatsoever. 

Either the promoters step back and let a professional handle the organisation or this will not end up well for them. Lastly , this is a new India. We do not dream about government jobs. We dream about startups. We dream about doing things (which may be wrong ). We sure as hell hate the status quo. So regional parties lost the most?

I've always felt we need more diversity in the Parliament, but it seems that thats not what the most of the country feels.

I think the politics of appealing to the weakest and the backward is over. Maybe we've really moved on from being a primarily poor country and moving towards being a middle income country. In which case politicians will need to change their tactics.


In this regard, Modi is the only one speaking to people's aspirations. Everyone else is still stuck at hand outs and government programs. I guess that isnt enough anymore. And its as if RG and all the other party heads have missed the memo.


TLDR: BijliSadakPani is not enough anymore Sambit Patra lost or Won. Can't trust the media these days. Riding the ""Me first"" wagon they have stopped verifying sources.

Edit:

He Lost. Imagine instead of working on policies Sambit Patra shouting in Parliament ""Mandir Yahi Banega"" [removed] Modi won election massively not just because of his work and performance but also because of the failure of Congress and especially Rahul Gandhi .hopefully they stop blaming the EVM and find out the real reason behind their biggest defeat and serve the country. This might be the time for BJP to start delivering their worth. The nation has shown trust, and its not something complicated that is needed, although it is hard. 

This election also shows a massive gap in the absence of a reasonable 3rd front. I hope the next election gives us some semblance of it at a national level, that people who connect can hopefully get behind. For eg, TN has no clue what they're doing. It all points to the fact that we don't have a good 3rd alternative. 

Democracy wins only when there is a ruling party and a non-senile opposition party working towards development with a north-star focus. Approach might be different, but things will be thought through. 

I'm not discounting what BJP is capable of doing, but their momentum is very high now. An influential opposition will ensure they don't derail. We can't say the same now. Rahul must resign Any ideas on how many for NOTA? AAP who? ...I‚Äôd say with finality that this is the end of ‚ÄúMuslim appeasement‚Äù in India.

If those of you that maybe have a better clue than myself could please chime in on what this means for Islamic populations in India and whether there would be a more dramatic mass emigration of these populations to more Islam-friendly countries? [deleted] What I disliked the most was the opposition leaders claiming voter fraud when exit polls showed things look grim for them. Just be gracious and don't let the efforts of EC, the security forces and thousands of people who worked to keep this election free and fair be clouded like this. Our EC gives training and seminars around the world to newer democracies on how to conduct elections. They must be doing something right The bad thing in all this is the opposition does not know how to oppose. Congress, Tmc,Sp-Bsp are people who have been in power for quite a while.(That is also a problem with modi). But the difference here is we see is the process in which was able to acquire such leadership is through hardwork. Do not get me wrong,the guy is shrewd and conniving and will do anything to crush. The unique factor is that he knows it is not his job to crush. It is ours. We have the ability to take power out. He knows that and now it is proven that having money and connections dont matter. Other parties lost because of one thing,they continuously forgot about our power. BJP has fault in many way and right now in my opinion the majority voted for BJP is because of modi and his potential. The way the centre has been working now is astounding. Due to the 2014 election I wished to become an ias officer. 
And one more thing you should understand. People are not stupid anymore. Lok sabha is a different beast and assembly is a different beast. I live in Maharashtra and I a way I can imagine Maharashtrans not voting for BJP. What people are scared about now is the uncertainty. BJP knew they will win but not by this margin. This chat reminded me why I came on reddit. To stay away from Indian keyboard warriors. Thanks for reminding me :) Fucking delhi people. Atishi worked so hard for them and they voted for some cricketer(50%+). I dont care if this wasn't state election. 

I hope AAP loses in next election and they shut down AAP. These people don't deserve true politicians. Its not worth fighting for such people at all. Let them have actors and cricketers. How is NDA -1 I thought they did better than before? The land of self-respect movement, Tamil Nadu, sends two Ambedkarites, four communists (one of whom is a Sahitya Academy award winning writer), and three women writers to the parliament. Left politics should have been almost decimated with just one member in the parliament, but Stalin saves Marx in TN and sends four communists to the parliament. Can anyone give an insight into why TDP lost in Andhra Pradesh? [This](https://imgur.com/a/TugSAjS) is the Official Assembly wise result tabulation for Moradabad Lok Sabha Constituency. NRC had a significant role in propelling NDA in Assam. Opinions ? Would've been good for the nation if Congress didn't lose by such a large margin. I was expecting a 40% majority votes for Congress and 60% for BJP. This crushing defeat is bad. A party shouldn't have this much power. It'll only raise their arrogance to the peaks. That little fear of 'people might not vote for me next time if I don't try to do be a good leader' is what kept them in check. I think congress is dead. Like this year they hunt people to stand for Election and next election there will br free seat to contest under their party banner. Really what break trust at exterme level rather than courrption for an    Indian people Just want to ask a question. Modi took advantage of polarization. That's definitely one of the major reasons behind his landslide victory ( apart from presence of an worthy opponent etc). But polarization means presence of at least two poles. Who created these poles? Modi? Or were these poles always present in the common mind and Modi just added fuel to it? If it was present before, who actually created this pole? And accepted Hindutva is one of these poles, but from where the other pole is coming? As far as I know, Modi is promoting (or taking advantage of) the Hindutva pole, but from where this other pole is getting formed (or has already formed)? I can't speak for everyone in TN but the folks i know in my area of TN (Trichy) voted against BJP because of increase in communal tensions and demonetization, all the BJP supporters i know in TN are upper class brahmins This election is a watershed moment in Indian history. Welcome to the New India‚Ñ¢.¬†Just to put this into perspective, this win makes Modi a democratically elected leader voted in by almost a half a billion people; a genuine and credible mandate. Let that sink in for the moment. Just from the backing perspective, he is bigger than Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Akbar, Prithviraj Chauhan or any other historical figure in Indian history. India has not seen such a leader.

For good or bad, India is going to change dramatically over the next few decades. It will be a far cry from the India that we grew up in, part Socialist part Capitalistic, looking for an identity, a place in the world. Our children will grow up in a completely different India which is for all intents and purposes already a Hindu Rashtra. No constitution change is needed. As Modi pointed it out in his speech yesterday, secularism is now a dirty word and no politician can use (or abuse) it anymore.¬†¬†

Bit by bit, Modi will consolidate power, just as Xi, Putin, Ergodan and all other authoritarians before him. With no credible opposition, he will do everything to keep himself in power, including destroying the very institution which brought him into power, the RSS. Although I do believe Modi has the right interests at heart and wants the best for India, he's a politician and self-preservation is going to trump national interest in the end. A credible opposition will eventually emerge and will most probably be from within the Sangh Pariwar itself.¬†

I personally am looking forward to this New India. I think it's going to be exciting. I expect a lot of changes, both good and bad in equal measure which I'm fine with. Just for keepsakes, I have saved today's newspaper. Whichever side of history Modi ends up in, we will look back to this day and recount it to our children and grandchildren.¬† [removed] Hope opposition asks good questions in parliament. Unchecked power is dangerous! Now that I have had some time to ponder on the result, I think that this government will not drastically change our country even with the majority seats. This will be more or less similar to other 2nd term governments. 

India will not really transform as much as we think it should under Modi's reign. The development will continue in the same rate, the system will be cleansed but in a glacial pace, the saffronisation will also be done relatively slowly. 

India will become a strong country with global importance in the future but it will never become a superpower. Indian people will have more money to spend but we will not be a rich country. 

Modi was right in his speech in a way, there will be no poor people in the country because they will be extinguished. Only a large middle class and a substantial upper class will remain. Because this was a mandate by the money, for the money, of the money.

All in all, India will become a bit more right-leaning country than before but it will still remain India. I will still be spat upon, riding my cycle, from a passing by vehicle. Some of us will be a uncomfortable at first but we will learn to adjust over the years. After all, we are Indians. Personally, I don't think it was a good idea to give so much power to a person like Modi.

But I guess, a significant percent of my countrymen disagree with me..... and I respect their decision.

Lets hope power does not ""corrupt"" him. Wonder why Nota never won smh [deleted] Can someone find out the data on how many women and non-Hindu candidates were elected as MPs? Or is there a list, official or unofficial, of the winning candidates? Kerala and TN mi amigos! Quick question from an Indian American. How did IUML win the Ramanathapuram election in Tamil Nadu? The district is 70%+ Hindu, so I was surprised to see a pro-Muslim interests party win? Was there just really low turnout for Hindu's, or was there another reason? [deleted] As a South Indian I am concerned about both the polar ends of the political spectrum.

The separatist dravidian movement is reflexively projecting the BJP as a Northern invader. 

The BJP's ham-handed approach has really alienated large sections of these states that are extremely concerned about their linguistic and regional identity. 

Both sides need to moderate their stands. [deleted] [removed] The NDA got 352 in the last election I am waiting for the Pulwama conspiracy theories This sub is swarming with the pro-modi supporters since the election. So many posts are downvoted to oblivion if it is anti-bjp or talking about anything related to the muslims.  Probably my own post is gonna be heavily downvoted because it is related.

&#x200B;

The recent elections are going to make the minorities feel nervous about their future. They might not get killed by the gau rakshaks on the open but they can face more open or subtle discrimination on areas like housing,jobs,education and even government services since the racist supporters are getting a validation this time. It already happened in modi's gujrat, the same can happen in the entire north. https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/minorities-made-to-live-in-fear-we-must-end-this-pm-to-party/articleshow/69500818.cms Am a Tamil guy who spent first 18 years of his life in Delhi and now 8 years and counting in Chennai. Was never really a guy who would take a side when everyone around me would fight about north India vs South India. Always thought all are equal Indians and this is just a silly childish fight. 
And Delhi being the home where I spent my teenage and adolescence, one day I do wanted to come back and live there. But after seeing the overwhelming majority of such an organisation (don't wanna go into what is wrong with them, save it) yesterday, I am done with the people of North. 2014 was understandable, people wanted change. But after all that happened in 5 years, why would such a majority want them back. I wouldn't be able to live with that mentality. Perhaps TN is the right place.

<Just needed a place to rant. I don't have any political inclinations to any other party as well. All are useless. But the ruling one is worse in more than one humanitarian grounds> can anyone tell when will elections happen on Vellore seat You can't fight a cult of personality with ideas and rhetoric. 

Godi media TV channels successfully brainwashed the electorate that Modi is Mhysa, a savior who ""sacrificed"" everything for ""Bharat Mata"", a ""strong"" leader, a person who works ""18 hours a day"" serving the nation. The ""300 killed in balakot"" bullshit was flashed non stop and was swallowed by the people. Ask anyone and they won't say they voted for BJP, they would say they voted for Modi. They might not even know who their local candidate was.

All the justifications we give like - maybe Jan dhan worked, maybe Ayushman worked - are hollow. Nobody cared about these schemes. BJP had the weakest, emptiest manifesto and no messaging on real issues. People voted for the superhero named Modi. A fictional character carefully crafted with a backstory, unrealistic achievements in his childhood and youth and reinforced with ""a day in the life of"" narratives with questions like mango eating and wallet keeping.

Modi occupies the same space in the psyche of the electorate which a godman or a ""chamatkari baba"" does. 

The southern states patting their backs for not voting for this charlatan shouldn't forget how they too have similarly worshipped leaders like MGR & Jayalalithaa in the past. Modi image building was from the same playbook in fact, creating a larger than life persona. Education has nothing to do with this. This is solely a lack of critical thinking and failure to question the narrative set by the mainstream media which comes from the ""accept what you're told"" mindset Indians are brought up with. The World Leader.......@ModiJi Yogendra Yadav fears that Bengal would become a battlefield for 2021 elections given the results in Lok Sabha.

It looks quite funny when Modi talked of inclusivity yesterday when his entire campaign lacked all those things. His twists and turns are lapped up quite easily and everything he said is forgotten conveniently.

The perpetual campaign machine while has reaped benefits for the party will probably leave our nation in a bad shape. BJP reminds me of the left in bengal. I can see it ruling on hate and this right wing vibe till economic numbers catch up and they fail altogether. If they really had some solution, they would have done something useful and not shitty demonetisation. But all that is fluff. We will see raw wisdom again. We will bitch again. They will use ram mandir and pakistan again in 2023. We will forget kathua and vote back again in 2024. This will continue, till the day, it actually won't. And that day, will be very bad. The sangh, just like CPIM will become a non existent entity, an entity whose ideas would be trashed. Unemployment has reached record numbers at a time when demographic dividend has peaked. It's a sorry state. The right wingers are fapping hire and fire as a solution. But that isn't even close to a solution. Electoral bonds, fudging gdp numbers, the list goes on and on

Every idea has its time. We had record low petrol prices. The BJP govt was a failure. And it will be a failure again. But it will win again. Mark my words. 

Amit shah is the mourinho of that bjp team. He can bring those results by tactics. But even moruinho couldn't save chelsea and manu what the fuck happened to AAP? I mean seriously voting gambhir over atishi, what kind of sickness is prevailing in Delhi? All this time I had heard that AAP had done great work in Delhi, reduced pricing for water, electricity, single window clearances, great school and everything but at the end of the day people still voted for BJP in Delhi instead of AAP.    
 I just can't get my around this fact, I mean motherf***ing delhi, what the hell were you thinking. For a second, I say that Modi is great and has insane schemes launched, but what happened to decentralisation of politics and the very basic idea of democracy. Man, honestly whoever shit people may have voted in other parts of India thinking at least Modi is better, I seriously would like to say to anyone from Delhi, boyyo you had an option to vote for a good candidate and yet you didn't. Man i really can't describe the shitload I want to drop on anyone from Delhi who voted for BJP. Worse is the fact that AAP was 3rd in most of the seats not even a runner up candidate.

1) stuff every open or partially available position with supporters. Heads of movie boards, education, military.

2) eradicate and arrest congress leaders where possible.

It‚Äôs the best time to switch to the turkey model.

Edit: saying this without elaborating is unfair.

The BJP is regularly going to face the fact that it‚Äôs chief economic and governance people are not world class. This means aside from increasing G - government spending, reading R - interest rates, and making laws leaner, they have little options.

This forces them to pull from opinionated and vocal members of society, who are not bureaucrats or economists. They will instead pull from the crop of vocal MBA types with the nest saleable credentials to make lateral entries into the system.

This also means that their government has a natural challenge when it involves unusual economic events. 

This is a political risk when it comes to keeping the voters who voted for Modi‚Äôs clean and reformer image, and a risk when it comes to incumbency on the ground which can‚Äôt be overcome by identity based incentives.


The BJP knows this, and has to make plans accordingly.

This means a plan beyond modi- which they don‚Äôt have yet. 

This also means a plan of best make use of their advantage.

Since they think long term, and learn from the world - this means putting people in positions of patronage and influence who will still remain should there be a turn around in their fortunes. 

Earlier, they didn‚Äôt have to worry about this - however this election showed that it is not a congress mukt bharat, and that the anti BJP views are likely to grow stronger.

Either they remove the anti BJP views, which I doubt they care about, or they deal with it. 

This is how they will deal with it, and keep their long term prospects healthy. So, not a single muslim MP from BJP? How many were given tickets? Why was Socrates apprehensive of democracy (5 min):

Politics,Something about Rahul Gandhi hit me hard.,1381,bokvwa,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bokvwa/something_about_rahul_gandhi_hit_me_hard/,446,"At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. 
At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Deaths are never good. People always get hurt for life and some take a lifetime to recover from the loss of a loved one. But grotesque deaths of not one but TWO close loved ones? I am surprised Rahul didnt go insane from the shock or become a drug/alcohol addict. 

He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots.",BaidDSB," Most of us would have hung our heads in same after being called Papu 24*7 but that guy has the balls to come out and face the crowd. I also lost my dad when I was 21 üò¢ Yes. This.

I hate congress and BJP both.

But I never got the unwarranted hate towards RG. (and more so, towards Kejriwal.)

I get that Indian politics isn't a clean haven, but ridiculing someone's identity and making a joke out of everything related to that person, is taking to another level.

I applaud RG for not giving up and still facing the crowd and the camera, with such calmness.

And frankly, his recent interview with Ravish, made me realize he's wayyy better than Modi. At least, he's open to criticism and questions. honestly, whoever wins this election, Rahul Gandhi has become a commendable person in my eyes. dude got balls the size of domes to be shamed publicly to such an extent daily in an out, and still act as a statesman of high order. He can use deaths of his family and honestly get a lot of sympathy votes, but he knows that would be biggest disrespect to their lives, he may not be a great politician, but he is a great person imo. His steep learning curve and resilience are actually inspiring. The interview with Ravish Kumar he says "" Rahul Gandhi has to be eliminated, and I must channel the public's mandate "". That is a very deep and Zen/Upanishadic thought. All the humiliation against himself and his mother (calling her waitress euphemism for prostitute)  he took it in stride and really grew. His message is about inclusion and love. He readily admits his mistakes and is willing to learn. And his assertive nature is very evident in his interviews. If youth in this country are looking for a life lesson this is the guy. 

On the other hand we have the hate spewing Modi whose life message is when you mess up dont own up and instead keep distracting by criticising others. I want to ask bhakts if their children would keep blaming their failures on others would they not teach them to take responsibility? This character deficiency becomes a virtue on Modi. Strange times we live in. Not a Congress or BJP supporter (NACOBS - everyone use this acronym to save time üòã), but Modi would've gained so much sympathy by crying in his speeches if something similar had happened to him. I dont admire Rahul but I absolutely hate Narendra Modi.

He is a grade 1 dumbfuck They call him that because 90% of Indians love making fun of others in a very mean way. Primitive Homo Erectus culture is well and alive in India. They even make fun of IIT grad Kejri because he wears mufflers, coughs and doesn't wear suits or what not. I too lost my grandma when I was 15. She used to talk to me everyday. Still, after 3 years I still feel like she's been talking to me every evening over the phone. There might be about 99 things wrong with Rahul Gandhi but his Never Give Up attitude is worth noting. Tbh I found Priyanka Gandhi's speeches much more compelling. Same for Kejriwal. Character assasination is an old but effective trick. To people saying Modi would've used the shit out of this if it happened to him, It is also worth noting that Modi has never appealed to people due to his OBC status. I think he uses the chaiwala status because it creates a better story, that's it. > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. 

You lost me with this line. 

&#x200B;

Sad for him and Priyanka Vadra to go through the ~~deaths~~ assassinations of their grand mother and father at such young ages and yet come out as decent individuals, Politics aside, we're all humans in the end. In this election, RaGa is clearly the lesser of two evils. But let's not get carried away. He is a greatly privileged individual who got far more chances in life than any less privileged person would get after so many fallures. 

The Pappu moniker is a creation of the BJP media cell, and I'll be the first to admit that it is somewhat exaggerated. But let's not forget that RaGa helped them a lot because a lot of his quotes are ridiculous. Now if you're thinking that Modi is just as much of a gaffe machine, I agree. The Congress simply has been unable to sell this idea as effectively as the BJP has sold ""pappu"" though.

Sure, the man currently sitting in the PM chair is a national disgrace. But not jump on the RaGa sympathy train just because of that. I agree with you but if politics is giving a shoulder for somebody who have suffered a lot then it should be given. No one denies that he suffered a lot and is not a ""pappu"" etc. But instead vote him for his vision, etc.
Voting him this way we will do the same thing as when India did by giving Modi votes because he was a chaiwala once. Rahul Gandhi is nice humble dude but wants to maintain status quo. Never though of it in that way, thank you for bringing this up Lets cut the bullshit. He was and continues to be part of the corrupt status quo political class, that includes the ruling party. Like every other politician, he will say anything to get your vote. Fuck Congress . And Fuck BJP. 

The Gandhis are all about power. They use the surname to invoke positive feelings that people have of Mahatma Gandhi and talk down to us during every election . Not to mention, RG and Congress play identity politics to stay relevant all the time . He has no other choice.

He is Rajiv Gandhi's son so naturally he had to be forced by Sonia Gandhi and other Gandhi family loyalists to step up to the plate and take command as the leader of the party otherwise it will someone overambitious who will hijack the party and marginalize the remaining Gandhis from the party. I sympathize with RaGa. It is difficult to cope with a loved ones loss, let alone to a brutal murder. 

But this isn't something unique to him. There have been riots and terrorist attacks across various cities in India and the people there had to literally go back to the same places where other people or may be a relative lost life (spirit of Mumbai, lol). At least RG had alternative to go to UK and get away from this. But most of the country did not.

While it's pretty shameful what BJP is doing with ex-PMs long dead, I don't see a problem with people calling him pappu. That's criticism of his thoughts and actions and he is responsible for it. In 2014, RG made Modi look much better and this time it's the opposite. >At 14 years old he saw his beloved grandma get shredded with bullets by the man he used to play with. At 21 his father was blown up by terrorists. He didnt even get to see his father's body one last time. 

Neither of them were saints or innocent victims. Rahul's dad got blown up by the same terrorist group(LTTE) he and his mother(Indira) started funding and arming in Sri Lanka, starting a bloody civil war that went on for decades with over 1.5 lakh casualties.

Rahul's grandma was killed by her bodyguards as a result of the Sikh insurgency she herself fomented by propping up Bhindranwale and his separatists in Punjab as an alternative to the Akali Dal. It took another decade before the situation in Punjab was normalized. Not before tens of thousands of lives were ruined.

Not to say it wasn't harsh on Rahul... But the phrase 'hoist by your own petard' comes to mind.

>He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves.

Rahul didn't try to become a leader anyone deserved. Until his coronation last year he had spent over 15 years in politics refusing to take up any position of responsibility. He refused to be a CM or a member of MMS's cabinet. He refused to be PM candidate in 2009 and even in 2014 wasn't officially named as such. 

He's only taking up these roles now because Sonia is too old and has retired leaving his party with no other choices.

> And never used pity politics to gain votes. 

Did you even follow his 2014 campaign? He started it by giving speeches where he'd remember being angry when his grandma was killed(Which made everyone cringe because that immediately led to the 1984 riots which he refused to address). He'd complain about trivial things like how his mother scolded him or how Indira made him eat all the vegetables on his plate. He was the epitome of privilege.

And this time he hasn't hesitated to exploit even issues of national security for his gain. He and his party have repeatedly tried to attack the Supreme Court and CJI, going against the advice of senior lawyers in their own party. They've tried to cast doubt on the armed forces over the surgical strikes, airstrike and even Pulwama attack. He personally hounded and harassed Manohar Parrikar while the latter was dying of cancer. I am quite sure OP is aware of all this.


>So when people call him Pappu or make fun of his dad's death, it fills me up with rage because when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life. Something most of us will never or never did suffer in life. 

This is such a vacuous argument. This is the general election, not Big Boss. Nobody is voting for candidates for their sob stories, what people care about is what they are as politicians. Lots of netas no matter how vile their politics is are look like pleasant, charming, even charismatic figures when you meet them in person. I've also read interviews of some journalists who've closely followed Modi(I think Aakar Patel) who say he has a charming and witty personality and they get along with him personally but hate his politics. But nobody highlights or cares about that. Also, most of his ""stupid"" image comes from him not being able to speak Hindi that well I think and also because he used to be a nervous public speaker. He belongs to the most corrupt family in Indian History. Since Independence, we have seen generation after generation this family has orchestrated a mockery of Indian democracy. Somebody has become India's first prime minister despite not being the most popular one. Then came his daughter. Then came her son. Then came his wife. Then came her son. This son turned out to be not so effective, so came his sister. Where does it end? People now seem to be waiting for Priyanka's son to grow up so that he can ascent to the throne. We should be ashamed of ourselves for this servile mentality. This family has transformed the grand old party into a family affair. In which part of the world a party president's job remain secure after an election debacle like 2014? Everybody else in this world has to prove himself or herself in order to enjoy power -- it seems rules are different for Gandhi family.

When would we learn to teach our child that ""no matter what his/her family background is, he can be prime minister of India if he really deserves it"". The truth is we never deserved independence from British. Sycophancy is in our blood. Servitude is in our DNA. We always longed for a king -- a mighty king who is not a common man - so that our king can rule us and we can concentrate on our daily affairs. Democracy is not for us. Let us declare India to be a monarchy and put Rahul Gandhi in her throne -- this would satisfy a lot of people I guess. I feel ashamed to claim our country to be a Democratic one. If Rahul Gandhi wasn't Gandhi and just Rahul, Would we still troll him the way we do now? Just a genuine question! > He went up and tried to become a leader that the country deserves. And never used pity politics to gain votes.

BS. He is there because his title is *Gandhi*. He's even *using* his sister to win election. Fearing defeat his sister eventually run away. What a disgrace!! You have very little or no knowledge of Nehru-Gandhi family. Kindly don't promote this family members.

Congress has completely failed against Modi-AS duo gang. RG can't even talk cohesively for 30 mins about demonetization, or botched GST or current economic situation, unemployment, farmer issues, healthcare, education, international relation, etc. There are so many issues, but he can't talk with a alternative plan. Like Modi, most of his answers are scripted and they are boring. He himself out on bail.

Congress has no vision, other than its dynastic demands. If Congress has to survive they need to find out another PVNR or MMS. They need to reject Gandhi family and reinvent itself. I'm no fan of modi and I align with a lot of Congress' recent policies but come on..

>And never used pity politics to gain votes.

Really? I've seen him mention that story multiple times at many rallies when he's spinning off his *I'm all about love* message.

>when you take out the political figure out of him, he is a person who suffered too much too early in his life

This is called an *appeal to extreme fallacy*. Some one or two among a million, hit below the belt and make fun of his dad's assasination (making fun of his dad's dumb policies doesn't count). It happens in public life. You can't use those extreme examples to justify the opposite extreme, which is that he is now magically good and deserving of sympathy.

He's a rich tosh who had a tragedy. There's plenty of others with much worse tragedies who don't use those to gain sympathy like he does, so cry me a river. Just a couple of decades ago, people had to go to jail and face torture for having a different political belief.

People laugh at him because he wants the highest job in the country with no qualifications or management experience, without even visiting his constituency for years, and he doesn't even seem to want it himself. You can't just spin the story around and say that everyone laughing at him is now an asshole because his dad was assasinated. Those are two different things. >I dont support Congress, but lets not insult or let neech aadmi's insult and hurt those soft spots.

lol the irony of it. Sanjiv and Rajiv were responsible for the deaths of thousands of minorities. Rajiv sent the IPKF to meddle in Sri Lanka and got nothing to show for it. IPKF was accused of war crimes. It is best not to talk of Indira who though India was her jagir. I have no sympathy for Congress or Rahul for that matter but that doesn't mean I will support BJP. I have had two deaths in my family too... one can recover. Teenagers are more resilient than people think. My take away from that trauma was that if you give up at that stage, it will be your own fault, and no one will be able to help. See I have thought of this, but the issue with that notion is that he doesn't know how to talk or connect. You have such a huge connect via this story to the Indian population but you don't.

He is plain simple not smart enough to be a leader and lives off his name. I joke this with my friends in whatever way RaGa is perceived with his being bullied around, being sent to a foreign boarding school at a young age and his episode with his Dad and Grandma he can change the perception any day. And with that image, he can easily become the PM You do bring some good points.agreed . He deserves respect.

However, I am done with dynasty politics. We cannot afford to have the prime ministership passed on as a royal jewel. Look. So many political leaders faced such issues throughout their lives. So many have overcome their problems and we have to respect them. But consider the privilege Rahul Gandhi has. He has a very powerful family who will swoop down to make sure he leads a luxurious life. How many of our common people have that? His only qualification is that he is son, grandson of two PMs and he hopes to become the PM just because of his tragedies. There are other leaders who worked their ass off for their political careers. They deserve better. This is not the medieval age. Exactly, i truly despise modi and his party of goons and fear mongering buffoons, but at the same time, i see no future with RG becoming PM, dude has no credibility in regards to that, only if congress looked past their dynasty politics and made someone like shashi tharoor the PM candidate, I would vote for congress in a heartbeat. I think you are mixing a lot of things here. And I agree with you that today's politics has reached new low levels and all our politicians are indulging in is mudslinging ... and no constructive discussion is happening.

Now to my disagreement with you ... on his family being dragged into the political debate

1. His father is a former politician and that too a former Prime Minister - who has contributed positively and negatively to the country.
1. His grandmother is also a former politician and a former politician who oversaw one of the darkest periods of Indian Democratic history.
1. Congress and Rahul continue to ask people to vote for them using the Rajeev, Indra & Nehuru's names


Secondly - on people calling him Pappu

1. This is a guy who's parent, grandparent & great grandparent were Prime Ministers of India
1. By virtue of above points - this guy has had access to best education, and life that can be offered to an individual
1. This is a guy aspiring to become the Prime Minister of this country
1. He struggles to talk and convey an idea or thought while talking
1. He is unable to come up with Policy Points and defend himself

I have had a good education and work in a relatively good area. Considering that he was supposed to have a better life than me, I do have an expectation that he will be better than me in order to become the prime minister. So yes - I will make fun of him when he fails so miserably. Is it double standards? yes - cause I do not have such high expectation of Modi - considering that he is relatively uneducated chai wala and is a cattle goon. Fuck off True as a person I believe he went through a lot, but imo I just can't see him as a leader Congress should break away from silver spoon leadership and give others a chance pretty sure there are competent leaders inside Congress party way deserving than Rahul G ( now don't come at me with whataboutism regarding with Modi).
Everyone is like ""what about Modi then"" let's be clear even if you hate him he play politics well Rahul G don't it's simple as that.

Now coming back I think in coming year Priyanka can be a good leader but still I don't know if I can support silver spoon fed candidates over people like Arvind Or even Modi. I can only imagine the pain he went through. He is in politics and nothing is spared here.

I think he was thrown into politics too soon and his lack of experience in his initial days reflected in his speeches and handling of party work. Congress needs a strong leader at this time and I don't see Rahul becoming one anytime soon. If I am being honest I don't think he is really made for politics. I don't think much of his political activity (so far), but not one politician in India has been scrutinized (derogated, ridiculed and underestimated) as much as he has been. After all that, he is still around & making so-called 'master politicians' tetchy & annoyed is just great to watch. RG has the balls to come out in public and answer tough questions. Unlike somebody we know. There is a difference between personal life and ruling a country i also lost my dad when i was in class 6 that doesn't make me eligible to be so sort of leader that is my personal life. As a person Rahul Gandhi is strong and i respect him but when it comes to ruling a country the case is different. [deleted] It‚Äôs really cool for the OP to empathize with Rahul Gandhi IMHO. I never even though of his past and how strong one might have to be to move forward from that. 

That being said, I don‚Äôt like the ‚ÄúPappu‚Äù comments not because I support him or think he has the mettle to take on any kind of a leadership role but rather because it does an absolute disservice to the democratic process in India. By calling him ‚ÄúPappu‚Äù, we glaze over his incompetence and inexperience. Someone mentioned earlier that he never had to work for the position and I think that it‚Äôs really important for people drill that into their heads.

Basically the outcome of the political scenario is:
1. The only major, non-communal political party is being headed by someone who doesn‚Äôt seem to have any achievements of his own other than being born to the most powerful family in India‚Äôs history.
2. People still think that because his last name is Gandhi, he has some kind of a privilege to represent the nation. These days I honestly think that Modi is a more accurate representation of what our country is than anyone else. (I am absolutely disgusted by this thought, btw).
3. We either sympathize and excuse Rahul Gandhi or utterly humiliate him. We don‚Äôt set attainable goals for the opposition, nor do we converse about what needs to change with all the parties playing the field. It‚Äôs always bad vs incompetence.
4. Locking of leadership roles based on nepotistic/mythological values is what has deprived the country of countless leaders  who could have actually made a difference in their communities. This system has blocked individuals access to both resources and potential.


EDIT: accidentally hit submit That doesn't make him a good leader
#Daenerys Politics shouldn't be a family business. Full sympathy with Mr. Gandhi. But he has to learn about the country and countrymen a lot. He might have to learn to become a visionary from other great leaders either domestic or international. Their is learning curve involved he has to go through with it...15 years down the line...he will be a good one to qualify gor PM‚Äôs post. At the moment he should lead himself to be a great visionary. I am NOT congress supporter in any way though. Totally non-specific to Rahul Gandhi, but I heard he is running for MP from two different constituencies. If so...how/why is that legally possible? Pappu to Prabhakar. 

He‚Äôs actually made an effort this time. Kudos to him. No matter what ppl say Gandhi name is keeping congress party together. This is their only ‚Äúglue‚Äù. Can you see the difference here. Prince Charles and Prince Harry lost their mother too. But their country poured lots of love to them. > close loved ones?

Who are already in short supply for people in his position.

Us nobodies can turn to a lot more people in our circle, relatively. Seriously thats what i was thinking, Rahul ji made lots of sacrifices in his life time and lost his family members in the process, but still look at him! His love for our country is astonishing. After all the tragedies he still want to serve his country. what a legend,he is truly our inspiration. Dhanya ho vo Maata jisne iss saput ko janam diya. [removed] I never hated him but thank you for making me realise this hard part of his life that most of us have forgotten. [removed] And this is something i dont know how the fucking hell nobody understands. But india is ready to insert logic in modi's radar statement.
EDIT: I can see some very great scientists and engineers of our country are getting really offended here.  As inspector Gordon would say :
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because Rahul is the Prime minister India needs, but not the one it deserves. So we‚Äôll hunt him. Because he can take it. Because he is a silent guardian, a watchful protector. A dark knight!‚Äù

If you actually think of it Rahul and Bruce Wayne share a similar character Arc. Both of them lost loved ones, are rich, compassionate and fight goons who want to destroy their respective worlds after all. Also if there roles were changed between modi and Rahul, i‚Äôm pretty sure there wont be a day without modi saying my dad and grandmother sacrificed their life for the country, vote for me. Irrespective of how bad your dad is, this is a horrible thing to happen to any kid while growing up, i respect Rahul for that, Modi would have made a hashtag out of it by now and gained sentimental votes > I dont support Congress 

No harm in supporting congress this time. Enough with BJP's ***~~change~~*** [removed] I really appreciate your post. I thought same things but when I shared it with my friends they showed me a video where RG says about potato machine. But one should never forget he never used his father's death as a tool in politics, no matter how inexperienced he is. People who has lost parent would understand this. It's pretty clear for me - if somebody would have asked me who would you hang out with? Rahul, hands down.

Modi is the uncle who just comes into a party and looks around while everybody gets creeped out and stay silent till he leaves. [removed] [removed] Never thought about this. Thank you for pointing it out! Well said. Here, take your gold. [removed] Bro watch akame ga kill He went up and tried to become the leader that the country deserves.
I don't support Congress. 
Dude, really ? maybe he has gone insane but we dont know about it formally Might be off topic but I think Rahul Gandhi is similar to Daenerys Targaryen. Both have powerful fathers who had been at the helm of power. Now both of them are trying to find their place in politics that their family have left them. Both of them not exactly suitable to lead but trying hard to make people believe that they can.",2019-05-15 05:38:35

It is really significant for Rahul Gandhi, even more so actually.

Easily the worst opposition leader this country has seen. If this doesn't get him to step out of politics then I don't know what will. Before you start bitching without reading the actual article, the last sentence in the article should boil down the main point for you.

>Modi has been able to neutralise the decades-old social engineering formula of caste-based parties. And this change may be here to stay.

Whatever his government might do for the country in the next 5 years, he has indeed destroyed the caste based voting that has plagued India for must of its post independence existence.

Hopefully no more ""I voted for him because we're of the same cast"" bullshit. The most liked person won.. democracy 101 I am so sad :( but congratulations to modi and his supporters. India's people have spoken clearly, loudly and across regions, castes and classes. They want Modi, and no one will do. As a person who believes in democracy, I respect this mandate of the people, even though I personally do not agree with it.

Personally, I think Modi's appeal and Amit Shah's strategy work like magic on India's people. I also feel that Modi and Shah will rule India for another 10-20 years.

There is probably some ground reality truth that is not being reported amidst all the right and left wing media reports. I don't know. But however different my own social, economic and political opinions are, I cannot disagree with facts. That's just basic science. India is now Modi's country.

May the Almighty grant Modiji health, peace of mind and a genuine sense of security and the wisdom to see that this time, again, he has got a chance to actually do good long-term beneficial things for India and for Indians.

Gujarat already has a massive solar park. The Modi Govt has already done one tree-plantation drive. Climate change and water shortage do not discriminate based on how you voted or who you support. Hence, it is important for all of us to realise that we will be forced to work together to prevent a dystopia, to prevent riots and to prevent Army rule and revolution. 

It is here that Modiji can actually make a change. Once again, he finds that he has the luxury of a simple majority. Destiny does not give such chances to many people, especially in a democracy. If he really wants to be the Nehru of this century, he can do that in the next 5 years by focussing on climate change and the environment.

He could ban plastic, he could mandate glass and metal containers for liquid foods, he could give a massive boom to the refrigeration and food storage industry by making a dozen cold storage warehouses in each constituency and in one fell swoop, he can remove the decades-old distress of the farmers by removing control of the middlemen. 

He could make a new ministry for Nitin Gadkari - Electric Transport Minister - and order him to layout plans for electrification of Indian railways - something that is already in starting stages.

He could rebrand MNREGA and start a ""Harit Bharat"" campaign like the Swachch Bharat campaign and get people to plant trees and forests. In the Sangh, he has a massive civilian army of completely dedicated, able-bodied men who will dutifully follow all of his orders in letter and spirit. Trees and forests are not political. But rain, water and crop failure can become political. Even strategically speaking, any leader who ensures water supply to rural India will be rewarded amply with votes and devotion.

The important thing is for him to realise that he has been given the rare second chance by destiny to become a great man and go down in history as a nation-builder.

I hope he will see this opportunity. I wish him the very best in nation-building.

It was a very enlightening election and in the coming days everyone will have a lot to learn and possibly to adapt. I think it's time for me to go back to science and technology and leave the politics to the truly passionate. I don't have the stomach for it.

Wishing Modiji all the best.

BMKJ, VM.

PS: This is my last post. I won't be replying. No hard feelings. India gets what india deserves. This is clearly rejection of creation of fake propaganda, caste politics and fear psychosis. I have never voted. I was in hostel for Vajpayee's election and have lived out of the country since the late 90s. 

When the country was prospering under Vajpayee, it was a shock to me to see him lose, but it was understandable to some extent. A lot of people felt left out of India shining. Then you had a lost decade under the Congress. 

This time I was apprehensive that Indians would make the same mistake. I am glad they did not. Isn't it too early to write off caste politics when we get dalits getting attacked for no reason regularly? Modi may have unified but caste still runs in this country. It's like celebrating a winning a race with only 2 people when one is handicapped n is this Jio effect? Any social scientist here? Why? He won't do jack shit. Just jumlas and more jumlas We'll see how ""significant"" it is when unemployment rises, riots resume and more institutions are ruined. But hey, Ram Mandir, right?!

Politics,'Those Living in Bengal Will Have to Learn to Speak Bengali': Mamata Banerjee Makes Bangla Pitch. The Trinamool Congress supremo reiterated that outsiders instigated the doctors' agitation in the state and accused the BJP of targeting the Bengalis and the minorities.,117,c0j2x4,https://www.news18.com/news/india/those-living-in-bengal-will-have-to-learn-to-speak-bengali-mamata-banerjee-makes-bangla-pitch-2186805.html,130,,GreatAd8," Tryna divert the doctor issue. Nice. End of Mamta didi is near... Amit Shah must be enjoying this. I think she tried to imposed this before in Darjeeling district and cities like Kalimpong and Kurseong which was dominated by the Gorkhas.
And oh boy that was a really bad time for specially that because the violence of Gorkhaland was brewing around that time. Mamata went full retard
....never go full retard.

I still fail to understand how Bengalis still support this dumbfuck Bengalis living in Mumbai should speak marathi now? I lived in bengal for 4 years, never seen a bengali this stupid. > Alleging that Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in the recently held Lok Sabha elections were ""programmed"", Banerjee also said that ballot papers should be brought back for conducting polls.

Why stop at WB...? jai shree ram didi Eee Noo Cholbe. mamta killing mamta It's just Hindi with all vowels replaced with an 'O'. How hard could that be? >Those Living in Bengal Will Have to Learn to Speak Bengali

Believe me Didi I am trying, it's just not that easy. :(

EDIT: For those who didn't get the joke - I've been trying to learn Bengali for a while now and it's been pretty fucking hard reading just wiki pages, since good grammar books are not available outside of India. 

So chill the fuck out folks, it was a fucking joke. God... She will make it an outsider Vs Bengali in the next election. Kya chutiyagiri hai. Chalo paani khaake aata meinü§£ I just know,

*aamhi tomharo bhalo wasi*

and

*rosogolla* Imagine every other state did the same.
We would all learn so much I am not in favour of this vague but if Mamata is truly for asserting Bengali pride then she has to make it mandatory for all CBSE schools in the state to teach Bengali as a mandatory subject. In particular KV have a mandatory subject of Sanskrit ? Mamta has to mandate Bengal in all schools including CBSE/KV and ICSE.

One may say it‚Äôs already mandatory but IMO not an optional but as a complete subject and contribute to overall grading. Gladly choose bengali over hindi for me. Hindi is not our national language. southerners will become second class citizens if hindi is imposed. I am sure the whole thing looks like a well planned strategy for WB Assembly Elections.... BJP has already started their Game plan for WB. Next Social media campaigns will start soon to demonize Mamta...

They're making him into a hero for the public there and hoping that the street cred he gets will translate into votes for him in the upcoming UT elections (whenever they are). It's eerily reminiscent of the British Indian Govt's attitude of building up the Congress (and specifically Gandhi) by engaging with them. jailing their leaders but not kala pani types, making deals with them etc. The most famous eg is that of Lord Irwin dealing with Gandhi one on one to settle the CDM which instantly made Gandhi extremely powerful much to the chagrin of pro British elements in India. It was still smart on the part of the Brits in hindsight. Maybe? They definitely have to.

Politics,"Rahul Gandhi to Quit as Congress President, Asks Party to Find Replacement: Reports",273,btlflr,https://thewire.in/politics/rahul-gandhi-congress-president-resignation-replacement,139,,Ajaatshatru34," Good for him(and his party). Why Gandhis don't run for CM candidate ?

Become CM of UP, Delhi ... show some good work and then congress should project them as PM candidate ?

The biggest mistake RaGa did was, not taking any significant responsibility in MMS government, by doing some good work in a ministry it would've been much easier for congress to project them as PM candidates. I believe the Congress is stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

One one hand, Rahul Gandhi should resign and hand over the leadership (given the abject performance 2 elections in a row). 

On the other hand, there are no viable leaders in the party with a national presence (or even a regional presence). Thus, Rahul‚Äôs resignation may lead to power struggles or very weak leadership which can cause the party to split and disintegrate. And if this happens, there will be no national level party left to challenge the BJP (for multiple election cycles to come, given that it takes a long time to get a party established at a national level; and with the BJP controlling the media, it will be nearly impossible for a new, or even existing, party to make itself known and heard). This helps the BJP much more than if Rahul stays on.


Damned if you do, damned if you don‚Äôt. I only hope they elect someone competent and not rush to the sibling. What the INC should do is learn from other democracies. In the UK for instance they have elections with candidates which the party members vote on. 

Let the INC come up with a few candidates who share their vision for the party, let members vote on them. And not FPTP, use a better system like IRV so you get a leader that most of the party actually wants. 

At this point, the CWC saying they're open to radical changes but not to letting RaGa go is ludicrous. You can't demand accountability and responsibility from your state level leaders if you don't demand it from your national leadership. Sachin Pilot should replace him. I think, in the long run, this will help Rahul Gandhi's political career. He should just quit his party posts and tour the entire country for the next five years or so, and then make a comeback. He should take notes from Jagan Reddy. I do not have any hope left, INC is at a stage which Apple was after their failure with the Newton, the INC is going to require a fucking miracle to get them out of this fucking ridiculous situation they dug themselves in. Shashi Tharoor? Good for him and congress Good. Who are the viable alternatives? Honestly, I sometimes feel sorry for him. I remember in the late 90's he was called as the most eligible bachelor of India. Here was this super rich kid, smart looking. Could have lived a flamboyant life, doing whatever the heck he wanted. But suddenly he is stuck in something he is not good at. Has to attend boring speeches, wear boring clothes. Don't know if he really likes being the leader. And finally the most eligible bachelor didn't even get to marry!
Good for him if he resigns and enjoys life. It‚Äôs good if he steps aside. I mean he tried his best and still couldn‚Äôt do much of an improvement in the polls. I hope they really think out of the box and get someone credible. This is really bad news for BJP Pretty sure replacement will be Mallikarjun Kharge. Its going to be Priyanka or soniya again. Respect. Does anyone think that he wanted out all along but there was too much pressure and this is the perfect reason to now finally do it?

He's always been extremely reluctant to be a politician Capt. Amrinder Singh? If he stepped down, really it'll be a very good for Congress and India Bhakts needs to find new ways to assassinate the character of new leader. They're trying to stall this as much as they can. They're using emotional blackmail, hoping he'll calm down after a while, suggesting he appoint a 'Working President' so that he can remain leader in name at least, and trying to get Priyanka as a backup. They've also delayed choosing someone to head the Congress MPs in the Lok Sabha, maybe so they can give him that post as an alternative.

This is quite unprecedented in Congress history. I've finally developed some respect for him.

My advice to Rahul: Leave all the chamchas behind and go on a padyatra from Kashmir to Kanyakumari to interact with ordinary voters and see what they really want. Then decide if you want to take back the reins or not. He should relegate himself to some smaller role, stay there for a while and then work his way up. For example he can spearhead legislative elections of any state and project himself as the CM candidate, lead his party to victory, become an excellent CM and take that state to new heights, then he can project himself as a worthy PM candidate.

He can learn a thing or two from the rise of his opponent Narendra Modi, Gujaratis adore him and he came to national scene due to his success in Gujarat. Manmohan Singh? Sachin Pilot and Mallikarjun Kharge? Just him stepping down will not solve the problem. Congress really needs to put forward some of their on ground workers. This is the only way people will get behind them and challenge Modi Shouldn't quit and shouldn't blame himself. The only way, Congress can redeem itself and be a viable party, is by letting this family go fuck itself into oblivion. He should get married and settle down.",2019-05-28 01:55:12
Politics,Non IT people who've joined IT stream.How much will an MBA help? In hindsight would you've opted for an MBA right after engineering ?,31,cf8ev9,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cf8ev9/non_it_people_whove_joined_it_streamhow_much_will/,25,Not sure if this is the right place to ask but still going for it. Advice is appreciated thanks.,seekingansforqueries," I'm answering a very small part of your question but nevertheless

Idiot who joined MBA right after engineering here. Have a very clear idea about why you are going for your MBA( or any masters for that matter). If you were forced into your bachelor's or you didn't like the stream you took in your bachelor's and so want to change, your masters will be the best way for you to change streams.


Two friends of mine who did engineering and didn't like it are currently going for their masters in US next month. One for video game design and one for data analytics. They both took the time out after engineering to understand what would work for them, worked hard towards getting the right credentials and then applied to some big universities and got it.

I did my MBA from a top 20 school in the country and still hated it. Purely because I went for MBA only for the bahuth scope hair bullshit. Scope is there only if you slog your ass off,which I didn't.

So if you are going for an MBA, talk to a whole lot of people before you male your decision same question here Don't go for any course if you don't know why you are doing it. Many young relatives come to my for mba advise disillusioned after grad but can't answer simple questions like what do you think you will be doing after mba? Do you have any idea about the kind of work you will be doing after the mba? Heck mostly they don't even know what specialization they like, marketing? Sales? 

It's stupid just do a course going in blind becuase ""scope acha hai"" Best to work for a couple of years and get some soft skills before higher studies. Remember if you want to do a job then managing people and politics matters a lot in your success. In my advice, getting some work experience just buys you time and helps you take better decisions. If you work for about a year or two, it would give you more clarity with respect to what you want to do in your career, perhaps you might like the job and stay back. More importantly, it would give you time to think with respect to what you want to do in life.

I am an IT engineer myself and had plans of doing MS from the USA. But my sister suggested me to wait and probably work for a year or two to get some clarity. In the two years I worked, I realized that perhaps tech is not my cup of tea. An average job and a below-average pay made me realize that maybe an MBA is a way out.

But honestly, working for two years is not something I will ever regret because it gave so much more than time, it also gave me some money every month and made me financially independent.

So spent a good amount of time in my life to crack all the top exams, and finally cracked them and got into one of India's top 5 MBA colleges. With regard to placements, as someone pointed out, freshers don't really have problems getting placed as nowadays companies want more freshers. However, they do miss out on certain roles and processes which are reserved only for those who have a decent 2 years of work experience.

Let me know if you need any help with the MBA scene.",2019-07-20 04:14:39

One thing that these election results tell us is that people absolutely don't want to see another Nehru Gandhi family member as PM anytime in near future. 

Even as someone who has a soft corner for RaGA, I think he's an incompetent piece of shit.

Kejriwal can lead the combined parties and give Rahul Gandhi external affairs portfolio, where he can enjoy his lifestyle. Bas kar pagle rulayega kya !!! Jagan Mohan Reddy tried hard for 11 years in opposition to TDP and Congress and he has finally succeeded. Rahul Gandhi should continue but instead of making his image he should now remove all bootlickers in Delhi and concentrate on giving leadership and independence to state leaders like Capt Amrinder Singh in Punjab or how YSR was in Andhra Pradesh. He should start a padhyatra for the next 5 years talk and have dialogues with all walks of life instead of just doing roadshows during elections.

Also this political climate in India is not an aberration but in synch with what is happening across the world.

**Manifesto**

&#x200B;

There are problems in the way we govern our country today and the political parties of today are too entrenched in their histories (dynasties, Hindutva, regionalism, casteism, communism, crony capitalism, et cetera) to be able to find the solutions India needs to move forward.

Indian humanist Party (IhP) is a facebook page for finding those solutions. We are not yet a political party and it may be years or even decades before we reach a critical mass. We see IhP as the forerunner of a political party that will one day govern India through humanist principles to build a happy, prosperous, clean, green, united, and safe country.

The principles of humanism include the primacy of fundamental human rights and using evidence-based rationality to make policy decisions.

**This is not an atheist organization.** The word 'humanist' as used above does not refer to 'secular humanism' but to the commitment that any interpretations of religious texts or any other ideologies that lead to the conclusion that violating fundamental human rights is justified will be considered unacceptable.

We believe that people should have freedom of belief and freedom from belief, but that the government and political parties should not be involved in propagating or inhibiting religion. That is a role we believe is best left for individuals and communities. The two principles of humanism that will be applied to all actions of the party are:

1. The primacy of fundamental human rights
2. Using evidence-based rationality and empathy as a foundation for decision making.

**It's time for India to move from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one.**

This is a 50-year project.

The RSS started nearly a century ago, in 1925, as a community of volunteers to create a Hindu rashtra as an alternative to the Congress vision of a secular India. In 1984 the BJP, a Hindutva inspired party, only won two seats, but over the last 35 years, it has replaced the Congress as the dominant force in the country‚Äôs politics.

Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition from a Hindutva inspired vision to a humanist inspired one, one we believe we feel will more effective in achieving our goals. The goal is to actualize the original vision of the Congress of 1947 to build an inclusive secular progressive modern nation, but to learn from their mistakes, one of them possibly being to focus on group identities rather than treating voters as individuals. We believe that this has led to communal voting blocks, polarization, and the inevitable emergence of a majority-minority narrative that is the unhelpful frame for almost all political conversations today.

**Metrics driven**

We will set, communicate, and measure our progress against tangible measurable goals. They will include our rankings on internationally recognized reports:

1. World Happiness Report (current ranking 122/145)
2. Human development index (current ranking 130/189)
3. GDP per capita (current ranking 120/181 as per the World Bank)
4. Education index (current ranking 112/188)
5. Life expectancy (current ranking 125/183)
6. Corruption perceptions index (current ranking 78/180)
7. Global peace index (current ranking 136/163)
8. Press freedom index (current ranking 140/180)
9. Gini coefficient of inequality (current ranking 99/158 as per the World Bank)
10. Gender equality report (87/144)

We will find ways to ensure that state and local equivalents of these metrics are defined and monitored to measure objective performance of PMs, CMs, down to local officials, and we will find a way to ensure a third-party audit of these numbers gives assurance to the public that we are being transparent and honest about the progress or lack of progress we have made on these fronts. We will never knowingly present factually incorrect data to the public.

**We are agnostic with respect to economic ideology**

Capitalism has created wealth and prosperity for many nations and as a general rule, we would like to move to a more liberalized economy which we believe will improve the quality of the citizens of the country, compared to a more government controlled environment. However unchecked capitalism can create perpetual inequalities in society and have an extremely damaging effect on the environment, pollution levels, and ultimately our health and life expectancy. And therefore we believe that there must be state support for the most vulnerable members of our society and state protection of the environment. We will make case by case decisions therefore based on discussion and debates on the pros of specific economic policies. In all cases, we will use data and expert advice to make decisions that best balance the competing demands of economic growth, reducing poverty and inequality, and protecting the environment.

**We are committed to internal democracy**

As a party, we will have regular elections to determine who will lead the party every 5 years. There will be term limits of 10 years with respect to the leadership. However to change the manifesto itself we would use a 2/3rds majority with 75% quorum of party members.

**National security**

We will work towards peacefully agreeing internationally recognized borders with our neighbors - China, Pakistan, Bangladesh. This could be bilaterally or with the help of external bodies such as the United Nations. The final decision is unlikely to be one that will make everyone happy on both sides of the border, but too many lives have been lost in all countries, and we want to find more productive ways of engaging with our neighbors. We will not cross the border to invade land or to attack people. We will improve our intelligence and defense capabilities in order to make up for the lack of strategic options that this decision would entail. We will not use torture or indefinite imprisonment as an instrument of state policy. We will continue to treat Kashmir as an integral part of India, we don‚Äôt believe that plebiscite is politically feasible stance for a party to hold in India, if it wants to get elected. Our goal will be to normalize the situation with respect to safety and economic growth so that the people of Kashmir trust the Indian government enough to voluntarily vote out Section 370 so they can benefit from a greater integration with the rest of India.

**Caste and reservations**

We absolutely stand against caste discrimination and at the same time we do not believe that reservations are a solution to caste discrimination. The vast majority of jobs are in the informal and private sectors where reservations don‚Äôt apply. The government only accounts for 3-4% of jobs. But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.

Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world. We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system. We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.

Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.

**Freedom of speech and the standard of discourse**

We believe that freedom of speech is the foundation of healthy democracies. We will work to improve our Press Freedom Index from 140/180. We will never use jail, legal means, and certainly not violence, to curb any individual or body for their criticisms of our work if we get elected. Even if they are making factually incorrect statements or deliberately lying. We will have unscripted unmoderated press conferences with all major newspapers and channels at least once in a month so they can subject our policies and decisions to a full and frank inquiry. We will have no restrictions on freedom of speech with the exception of credible incitement to violence and deliberate lies to defame private individuals and businesses.

Individuals and businesses with net assets of more than Rs 1,000 crores will not be liable to protect themselves from defamation except from other individuals who are also above that threshold. This is to prevent rich individuals and businesses to use expensive lawyers to stifle any criticism of their practices by common people. We believe that they are insulated from the effects of malicious rumors but the benefit of talking about corporate or industrial corruption more openly will be of disproportionate benefit to the society. We will work for the removal of blasphemy laws and laws to do with seditious and anti-national speech. We believe that both gods, if they exist, and the country if it is being run fairly, are strong enough to withstand criticism. We will never brand anybody who disagrees with us an anti-national, we will assume they have a different idea of what is best for the people of the country and we will share our views on the matter.

**Science and business**

We will make a concerted attempt to place ourselves at the forefront of technological advancements in the world and to profit from this through world-class businesses. We want India to be at a place where it can contribute technologically superior products like Apple, Samsung, Nokia, Sony. We want India to be a place where Nobel Prize winners in the Sciences come from. We‚Äôre fed up of being a developing nation. We want to be a contributing nation.

Satyamev Jayate.",toughbrain," 1. Are you anywhere else other than facebook?
2. Don't you think Humanism is a highly misunderstood word and it might only drive people away if getting people to you is your idea?
3. I see you have a highly ambitious vision (though vague here) is really appreciable. I will take a peek into it. Aaaah, the walls of text just got 10 feet higher. Damn, that took a while to settle in! I really like the fact that someone in India is actually trying to setup grass roots for humanity development and management.

A few tips from my side:

1) It'd be really awesome if you had a subreddit, cuz Facebook can become really Obnoxious, what with all the meme pages, and all the hundreds of friends that people can have. Atleast with a subreddit, Moderation is much more strict, there's pinned posting allowed, and well, there's a lot more control in general.

2) Are there plans to set up a fort location, i:e One location/constituency, that you'd prefer to start with, and focus on first? Cuz I think if you'd start with one, you might slowly reach state-level, which is more than enough to get the nation's attention. I like your long term approach. Anything is possible with tenacity and will power. Good luck to you. The trouble with your plan is that it will strike the vast majority of Indians as being culturally inauthentic. The idea as presented simply is not Indian. It is just an artificial and weird mish-mash of a lot of things that seem to look good at this stage in history (2019), but it doesn't have deep roots in the soul and soil of the land.

BJP is successful because they have a vision for India that (as per their narrative) is as ancient as our earliest recollections of India itself. This vision is made of songs and stories and Gods and saints that are deeply embedded in a lot of Indians' consciousness and their understanding of who we are. They can cite ancient scriptures as sources of the values they advocate. Their imagery and rhetoric have deep roots in the nation's history. Take the icon of mother India or Bharat Mata. Some say that this idea is just a copy of the corresponding European ideas, but every Hindu sees Bharat Mata as just another instance of Shakti, the mother goddess, which is an idea that has deep roots in the Hindu psyche nourished by a vast fund of religious literature and practices.

>	Our goal is to learn from, and replicate the successes that the RSS and the BJP have enjoyed to help India transition

What RSS achieved over 50 years is only possible if you believe strongly in one ideology. Religion and their rules are a tool to make people cooperate on a large scale, without which they will not. 

I feel it's impossible to create organized movements in that kind of way anymore, unless you use a strong ideology to unite people. But if you do that, it will create blind faith and extremism and that will be counter your original purpose. Moreover, it will counter act against one of the most important qualities that people need in India - Individualism. 

Look at the best countries across the world, they don't have any popular organized groups throughout the country. The Vegan community is the closest comparision I can think of in those countries and even vegans are famous for being intolerant, adhering to their strictly enforced guidelines within the community. As soon as you place the identitiy of a community or a group above an individual, it will lead to the same result. The devloped countries and their institutions are succesful because the majority doesnt beleive in any single ideology strongly, all of them value individual thoughts so it becomes impossible to compromise everything, all at once. 

Therefore, I don't think you should try to replicate their success. But I also don't know a solution to how it can be possible to impart these important values without making under a banner. I really like this idea, and to be honest I was thinking of something like this myself. I'd really like to join, or at the very least contribute to discussions and present ideas and solutions.
 In addition, somebody mentioned here that the ideology might not appeal to Indians the same way that hindutva does and I believe their statement holds a lot of truth. AAP is an example, so it should be a priority to figure out how to strongly appeal to the masses. 

Overall, I want to thank you for being the change you want to see and for actually doing something lol. Please make a sub, not everyone of us are in FB. Police Reforms are the key to unlock the India's potential, How else do you think we can bring fear in the minds of criminals in India? If this takes off, it'd be great!  
I look forward to casting my vote for the IhP one day!

&#x200B;

My only concern is, I don't think your message and philosophy will resonate with the same electorate that voted 'Hindutva Eva Jayate' into power. What's your views on North south cultural divide, LGBT rights? And I'd like to repeat a question someone else had raised is there any place you'd begin, a movement starts only if you begin and progress continually. Indians: Neva! > But as a result of the controversy on what percentage of jobs/educational places should be reserved an entire brand of politics has emerged that focuses on reservations and this has cemented caste identities into place indefinitely, and perhaps for eternity. 



This statement is similar to that of Holocaust deniers. Caste system and discrimination are sins of ancestors, you can't say Muslim are responsible, or reservation cemented caste identities.


I would like to see study or source which says caste identities were less fixed before implementation of reservation in 1947. I repeat, your statement is similar to telling Jewish people that Nazis were not responsible for Holocaust. You can't whitewash thousand year history.






> This has led to zero-sum caste-based electoral politics that distract from the issues of clean drinking water, jobs, law, and order, etc. And the people who suffer most from this in our opinion are the most vulnerable individuals associated with lower castes.


Mandal politics came as reply to kamandal politics. Dalits voted Lalu yadav because ranveer Sena did yadav/dalit massacres. Check the links between murli manohar Joshi and ranveer Sena.



Poverty in backward castes was reduced from 1991. Incidentally that was the time when caste based identity politics started. Your claims that identity politics has hurt dalits won't be accepted by even forward castes.










> Over 70 years after independence the Dalits are perhaps among the poorest 200 million people in the world.

250 million dalits are richer than ST and Muslims. Check facts.

> We believe the solution to the caste problem is world class primary education. 

Lol. I can't even. 

> When penniless immigrants enter Scandinavian countries, their children get free education of such high quality that within a generation they are able to live lives of dignity and possibility. 


It's not about education, it's about ""equal opportunity"". You stop discrimination and it's enough for dalit progress.

> This along with a stringent focus on ensuring that violence against any individual is promptly acted on will, we believe, be a more sustainable and effective solution to the legacy of the caste system.

How can you give justice to 70% SC,ST,OBC when there is zero judge in supreme Court from these castes? What about 90% supreme Court judges being brahmins?



> We also recognize that this is not yet a politically viable solution and that many Dalits will understandably feel that something is being taken away from people of their community 

Are you quoting Sumitra mahajan and her chocolate and kids comment about dalits?

> on the assumption that caste prejudices will fade away by themselves, of which there is no persuasive evidence.


But there is persuasive evidence for that. 

> Our approach would, therefore, be to leave any reservations as they currently exist untouched. We would instead focus our energy on investing in education and law and order, till the trust levels are built up among Dalits, etc. in the viability of this pathway and buying into the proposal that disbanding the reservations system is the way to ending the caste system once and for all.







Your assumption that SC,ST wont vote for you if you said anything against reservation is absurd. You have freedom of expression which dalits respect. BJP is against reservation. In Bengal and Karnataka there are 24% dalits per state. Whole BJP victory in WB, Karnataka, Orissa was possible because of dalits. More dalits voted for NDA than UPA.



You should have taken advice from some social science professor before writing this. It'd be really helpful if you added in links in your post. 

Also, kudos to taking the effort to trying to make a change. Atleast, you haven't given up like me ‚úåÔ∏è How naive to assume that the social, economic, and political inequality is not due to caste and just by providing jobs every issue will be solved. This is the problem of this sort of liberal, we all are equal, agenda, it presumes that opportunities are equally available for all. Whereas it overlook the fact that how Dalits and Adivasis are still discriminated and killed for even attaining some kind of social mobility. props to people who read the entire thingüëè

It would be nice to add a tl;dr in the end thoü§† You will certainly have support from Enlightened youth who are of small proportion.But Its gonna take decades for good amount of common people to support and follow your party, Like you mentioned it's gonna take a long time. But I hope you progress swiftly. Humanist? Yeh kaun jaat hai? What is your take on illegal immigration from Bangladesh ? Maybe a TL;DR at the beginning to give readers a vague idea about what's followed. What's your take on Christian missionaries and Islamic extremism? Our philosophy is to leave the existing reservation system untouched - you lost me on that one. 

If the reservation systen has not changed anything in 70 years, why should it stay on?

Why should we have a system where merit is not the primary criteria and group after ethnic group agitates to name themselves as backward - Jats and Marathas? Not calling yourself an atheist organisation is fine and dandy because we know how scary that word is to the uneducated, but trying to exclude ""secular"" doesnt make sense. Most of the policies your organisation supposedly stands for I can get behind, so I still want to see where this goes. Good luck. If you mean Hindutva as a religion, then definitely yes. But Hindutva as our culture/race can't be removed from us. Because that is what we are. Everyone can practice any religion or adopt a newer one, but the race is not a matter of choice. BJP is totally losing it by mixing Hindutva as a religion and Hindutva/Bharatiya as a race. If you are against affirmative action and reservation then that is terrible. Shows that you have put zero thought into your policies and are just rambling. This is not going anywhere. Atrocities against dalits are increasing and your solution is to take away the one helpful ladder they have? Won't lie, I am from right wing but I'll defect if you abolish reservation. You have my vote. Are you have an AMA . Fat Chance. You will not come to power even in 1000 years as your ideas needs people with good reasoning skills - asking questions was never encouraged in India. Yawn ! üò™ I consider myself humanist. I see few fundamental issues which I figured through lot of introspection. These seem straightforward but no one follows these:

i) Do not give freedom of speech to a group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of speech

ii) Do not give freedom of religion to group/person who campaigns to demolish freedom of religion

iii) Do not give property rights to group/person who campaigns to abolish property rights 

iv) Do not give human rights to persons who work against human rights.

and so on.

Criticism welcome. This naturally eliminates commies, jihadis, anti fos activists, criminals etc. and yet is 'humanist' in nature.

Logic is systems should have survival instincts else they die, however noble they may be. It this gonna be a face for new BJP .",2019-05-28 01:06:02

In my opinion, this is shameful for someone who holds the prestigious position of the Prime Minister of India. Can anyone clarify why he is calling Rajiv Gandhi ""corrupt no 1""?

No doubt Parrikar was the best politician PAnjim has seebln, the current replacement for BJP was a arrogant man who made false promises of doing any good. Babush, a rape accused, there have been alot rumours that the rape was planted in fear of him standing for panjim elections in wake of parrikar getting sick. Babush had done major development for his village where he was the MLA (Taleigao). 
 Panjim has it's sets of problems which have not been touched since 25 years hence the people have decided to give  a chance to someone who has delievered before. He gets only 2 years to prove him self since the state goes back into elections after 2 years.

Inidan politics is broken, a rape accused wins here and accused terrorist wins somewhere else. 

 Peace to all.

Do we not have anything like America where a member of parliament can call CEO of big corp and question them directly in front of camera? There are so many such videos featuring AOC and other elected representatives in USA which makes for interesting viewing. USA is just as messed up as India but at least individual elected politicians there seems to have some kind of power which seems to be missing around here. We need politicians like her, but politicians like her will not survive the Indian political system. American politics is dirty, but nothing compared to Indian politics. She is #BlueTrump, and coincidentally might be the next president after trump too. If you are conservative and you underestimate her, you're going to be conservative version of 2016's left. Myawati or riot. This is how a politician like her will he treated in India. 1) She is a female, so she has to be sati savitri and indian kulch pliable. Because she won‚Äôt be she will be called a whore or something of that euphemism. 2) She is going to be mercilessly called names for being a female 3) She has morals. Big no no in Indian politics India has multiple politicians like her. There's multiple social democratic parties in India. We saw politicians like her emerge in this election like Atishi. The conservative right wing majority ensured that such politicians will not come up in India. 

That being said, politicians like her are needed, who come up with implementable policies and not like bullshit like NYAY. She is a badass. USA politics or Indian politics, she will survive and thrive. We already have our own AOC, she's called Smriti Irani.

Like youtube channels, blogs, apps. etc. I do read about the major news stories whenever they popup, but I feel that if there was a detailed discussion about these topics, I wouldn't be able to contribute much to the conversation and I'd like to change that.",dalai_llama_," You are not supposed to know everything. Just start reading Newspapers, you'll automatically start picking up topics of interest and gain knowledge about them. If you'll force yourself to know about something just to make conversation trust me it won't work. Media right now in this country is either paid for by one side or the other. We are in a dire need of a neutral channel/source. 

I would suggest you try to balance yourself with opinions from all side. I would suggest you to look for sources from both sides of the coin. Do not place yourself in the source which suits your view of the world most. It would result in a echo-chamber.

Also, don't close yourself to the only English sources. 88% of the country is not English speaking. I would suggest to check sources of local languages as well.

I disagree with the subreddit of /r/India at many points but I still engage in this subreddit in a polite manner. /r/India is a good source for news. Like /u/igivequalityhugs, I would suggest for you to research issues which are interesting to you.

> I feel that if there was a detailed discussion about these topics, I wouldn't be able to contribute much to the conversation and I'd like to change that.

If you don't know anything about the issue, try to listen to what others are saying. It may not be true but it will definitely give you a starting point. These are meant to only be suggestions, and heavily biased ones, but:

**Do:**

* Pick a (good) newspaper, subscribe, and read it every day. Your definition of ""Good"" will be different from mine, but best to steer clear of anything Times of India-ish, i.e. whose definition of news skews towards only Bollywood, sports and politics. Physical papers in my mind are much better, but e-papers (actual subscriptions, *not* just the website) are good too. 

* Read (good) books, on topics surrounding the issues discussed in the news. Nothing happens in a vacuum, and everything has historicity. That historicity may not be evident at first glance, and so reading books that give you context will help you deep dive.

* Google things when you read them and you don't have context. Or, if you don't have time, write them down on a note or something and revisit them later. 

* Understand the rough difference between news, opinions, and events. The event is the important thing that is happening. ""News"" is updates on the facts that surround those events. Opinions are interpretations by experts on the facts that surround the event. Not all events are important, not all news is real/relevant, and not all opinions are true. 

* Develop your understanding from multiple sources. Context is important, facts are important, history is important. Any one source will miss out on some of all of those three. 

* Use your head. If something seems to good to be true, it often is. so that's when you deep dive and do a little digging to understand what isn't being told to you. This is the part where you change from being a passive consumer of news to an active participant in current events. 

* Attend public talks, public panel discussions, book launches, etc. that are in your area (if you live in a major city). a lot of them are masturbatory exercises in self-aggrandisement, but they usually have experts who have had time to hone convincing arguments that are worth listening to even if you don't believe them ultimately.

* Learn how to form your own opinion. Everything should be questioned. Even if you're Jordan Peterson or Ben Shapiro fan, be one after doing the proper leg work and thinking about what they're saying. 


**Don'ts**

* Do not rely on apps, blogs, and youtube channels. Apps will always shorten the information, so you don't get the detailed discussion: at best you'll get a few extra sentences to a headline that give you the wrong context entirely: InShorts is a horrible app and it becomes *very* obvious when someone's entire argument is derived from an InShorts piece (or for that matter, a reddit post). Blogs can be great sources of information perspectives that could otherwise be suppressed, but you need to be sure that you have the ability to separate the bullshit from usefulness. There are blogs out there that unequivocally support demonetisation, for instance. The same goes for youtube channels: there's only so much they can dive into a topic, and there's a lot that goes unsaid. They're great for getting some background and as a starting point in some instances, but they *cannot* form the entirety of your understanding of a topic. Or rather, they should not. 

* Do not read a billion different sources. Not all events have equally weighted sides (e.g.: Climate change). And honestly, trying to find a billion sources can become exhausting. Pick a main source you tend to trust, and a few others to cross-check.

* Do not watch TV panels on a regular basis. 99% of the time, the amount of time and energy you waste on watching a panel on TV would be better served reading something.

* Do not use Reddit as more than a jumping-off point. Reddit is great as an aggregator of links that are useful, and it's fun to talk to others and see what opinions people have about news that's happening, but it's not a substitute for doing your own legwork. It's an echo-chamber.


**My own imperfect means of staying current**

1. I use The Hindu as my main source of information.

2. I've set up an RSS feed using Feedly to access the Press Information Bureau website for government updates

3. I read a lot. And Google/wikipedia what I don't know, and then use the sources contained therein to go deeper when I have the time. (this helps me when something's happening on, say, Twitter, where I can find out what's happening without getting sucked into it).

4. I will very occasionally watch Lok Sabha TV/ Rajya Sabha TV

5. I'll always read links that friends send my way, because I'm lucky enough to have informed  friends so even if 
what they send is complete trash, it's still trash worth having a glance at. The old school way, newspapers and magazines. Especially the editorial sections. Whatever you do, don't use reddit and r/india as a source to better understand Indian politics or news. Freaking biased as fuck Read the hindu and watch RSTV shows the Big picture, india's world, policy watch and security scan As others mentioned, read newspapers. Understand differences between editorials, opinions and facts. Read books. History, politics etc. There's no one textbook that you can read and understand entire politics. Start with India's political history, read India After Gandhi. 

If you travel, I recommend listening to podcasts. It takes the weight off your shoulders of finding relevant topics. The Seen and the Unseen is a good podcast, Newslaundry has some good ones - Hafta and Charcha. You'll only get a better understanding by exposing yourself to multiple ideas - newspapers, books, podcasts etc. And keep away from any apps that try to save your time. Understanding news and making sense of it takes time, there's no way around that. Apps that try to save your time will eventually turn click baity. Vision ias monthly current affairs . They are concise and free of cost . I am cereal readin papers don't work cause it functions with presupposed familiarity. because they don't have infinite space. so first you gotta contextualize it. talk to people. because there is no beginner-oriented source I know of, except your smart friends. 

slightly longer path: correct way to read papers: pick the biggest stories of the paper, doesn't matter which paper. cover story of the Sunday et, etc. strongly suggest the epapers...just select and Google what you don't get..

another pointer: read up on past scandals..it's a finished story, not one you have to watch unfold over weeks/months, it's got the most info on the underbelly if there is one, and it gives you greater idea about the economy and it's structure, which does not change over decades.. 

slowly you'll start being able to contextualise the lakh crores, the budget, get a broad overview of the industries, etc. it's a long path but an important one, I'm also just beginning it. fucking genx left us fuckall in terms of infrastructure, pollution, population, we have to wade into their muck now.. Not sure if someone has already suggested this but podcasts are a GREAT way to catch up on Indian politics and current affairs. I listen to News and Views and the Big Story. Both of them are by the Quint and regularly add short episodes. There's also The Seen and the Unseen which has much longer discussions. The Pragati Podcast and Ganatantra are pretty good too. 

Talking Books is one of my favourites. They invite authors and discuss their books. Topics are wide ranging. It's by Indian Express. Stop browsing r/India for news. You if want just news then subscribe to newslaundry. It does a podcast named ""Daily Dose"" which gives short and quick about what's happening around. I get a lot of news here, r/india The Hindu Knappily I wouldn‚Äôt recommend YouTube. Most of them are click bait crap this sub Trust me, every news channel is either biased or paid. Like NDTV will show all bad for BJP and Zee News will show all good. The only thing that is left is our good old DD News. You may not enjoy their style, because they will only show you news not drama, but trust me they are the only neutral News source. And you can follow All India Radio for further updates. https://www.insightsonindia.com/2019/05/23/insights-daily-current-affairs-pib-23-may-2019/

While no one can claim to be unbiased. I do strive hard to cover all sides. Twitter. I'd say begin with the foundation - Civics. You should know the basics of how the government functions - when and why we have elections, how the budget is voted on, which committees have power over what. Just pick one like the CAG, and get the general sense of how it works. Then maybe look at the judiciary, learn the difference between the high court, supreme court, etc. Get the big picture first and understand how the country works. Armed with this knowledge you will more easily be able to spot bullshit like for e.g. Economic reports, which are based on data collected from such and such committee/census/survey. If you know that numbers are only generated once per year, its easy to spot a lie when a politician manipulates them to mean something else. Or how and when development funds are allocated. So if a politician claims credit, you'll know that those funds were allocated 10 years ago. So many little things. Then you can try to get into geo-poltics and foreign affairs. What are the treaties that we are a co-signer on.. how have we developed our trade relations with other countries, etc. Then maybe a bit about economics.. what is inflation, how does the RBI set interest rates, etc. You don't need to go super deep into every topic.  Maybe you can then go into regional politics. What is the history of the Shiv Sena - BJP alliance in Maharashtra and how the NCP plays into this, or the differences between the DMK and the AIADMK and the historical nature of their rivalry. 

The only advice I'd give is don't get too caught up with current news. It takes months and years to generate detailed analysis of things. Try to stay away from these ""breaking news"" type articles, which are always light on real information. They only have superficial information of who said what and that stuff only matters if you care about drama. 

A country doesn't work like a rickshaw where it can change its course at any given minute, its a giant slow-moving super-tanker. Many events which might seem super important because people talk about them a lot, will eventually seem irrelevant because in the grand scheme of things, the direction of the super-tanker didn't change even a bit. * TheLiar.in for far LW

> On Sunday, Atishi said: ‚ÄúThey cannot question the work of AAP government and they cannot talk about their own work. This is why they are spreading lies about my caste and religion. It indicates that Lovely is going to lose his deposit and has accepted defeat,‚Äù she said.

Why should it matter even if she were a Jew? And so what if she's Jewish? Shame on Congress for not only lying about it, but for making the fact of someone being Jewish a political issue. Shame. Congress will save us from the communal politics Heh, the last 48 hours have been zany. We had our own ""The Jew fears the Samurai"" moment. Jew ho ya mountain dew as long as she is good candidate I would vote for her. Her work and ethics are her choice, the religion she was born in sadly isn't. People need to get their priorities right I don't know.  Hardcore sanghis love Israel.  So I guess they would vote for Atishi - wouldn't they? Indian politics is just based on caste and religion.

She dropped her traditional surname and adopted for a surname ""marlena"", which is derived from Marx and Lenin. She wanted that people should judge her based on her work rather than her lineage. 

But if a political party is spreading false rumors about her, she has to defend it. There is nothing wrong if she would have been a Jew. But have a common voter would have voted for a Jew Atishi. No, because no one cares about the real work done by the candidate, it all boild down to what your caste and what is your religion. First time ever I've heard of someone being called a Jew in India as a negative thing. Usually we love Israelis, esp in Goa.

So anti-semitism has reared its ugly head here as well? Damn. Practicing Muslim and a hardcore anti-zionist here.


I don't give a single shit if she's a jew. She did more in 5 years for her constituency than what Muslim Leaders in mine for the last 20 years. So fuck them, fuck BJP, fuck Congress and fuck everyone piggyback on making the chutiya out of Muslims and fuck these retarded Muslims who fall into the nonsensical ""all Jews are bad"" trap. Why should it matter if the candidate is Jewish or something else? she's got a beautiful smile. So what she was a  jew? who cares what her race, religion, colour, caste, or financial status is? What matters is if she is honest and what work she has done. Delhi school are phenomenal thanks to Atishi and AAP party. Let's stop vooting for celebrities who have received money to enter politics. Let's vote on what work they've done. She is a brilliant person, I would choose her over any other fucktard. Pardon My ignorance but can anyone convert into jews just like that?  what was congress thinking... I'm surprised at how so many of these comments are shitting on BJP while the title clearly says CONGRESS. I'm not trying to defend BJP or anything but by the looks of this sub over the past few weeks it's clear we people have very poor memory. Congress looted us all not long ago, yet I see so many idiots holding banners for them. True..BJP is no better either and that's exactly why we really need to get out of the mire that are these two parties, if we ever want to become a better nation.

We really don't need the government control on prescribing any religion. Religion and politics cant go together This is good as long as it is accompanied by proper medical attention and the patients consent to listening to the chants. Many people find chants relaxing. What if they're not Hindu?.It shouldn't be compulsory for all but if someone wants it then no issues but actual treatment should not be compromised. To be honest, I find gospel chants more relaxing Nothing wrong in trying it, but it should be subjected to the same level of scrutiny as every other medical treatment.

\> Joins Shive Sena

[My reaction](https://www.meme-arsenal.com/memes/34a8769b087cc34940b919533bbc2dfc.jpg) The funniest part was that she took everyone for a ride. There was so much support for her on Twitter. And now all of them would be repenting it. 

LPT: Never support a politician. And she's joined the Shiv Sena.. lmao Few points independent of each other

- Goons and lumpen elements in the party are shameful. For morality and decency, they should have been dealt with.  The blame on the incident is only on the those people and no one else. 

- She was a great spokesperson. Made good contrubutions to the party. A loss for the party no matter how you put it. 

- If the reports of her joining the Shiv Sena are true then, well that party has no shortage of goons either. It would have been better if she had joined another party, AAP, JDS, TRS etc. Any party except this. 

Anyway best of luck to her. I am sorry for the way she was treated. Everyone knows shiv senas selling point is women empowerment. She spoke of secularism  
Now she joined shiv sena  
Once a lodu said  
Hypocrisy ki bhi hoti hai seema In chutiyon ke liye ideology wideology kuch nahi hai. Sirf ticket dedo toh kutte ki tarah wafadaari karenge Good for her to take a stand. Congress probably needs her more than she needs Congress, and how much of leaders would Scindia and RG be if they cant fight for the right thing within their own party. I wonder what song will Priyanka Chaturvedi sing after joining Shiv Sena later on. It was ""Rishto ke bhi roop badalte hai, naye naye saanche mein dhalte hai"" few days back. ""Ek political party se jaenge, ek pe aagaye hain"" will suit her today. Damn. She took a hard plunge. From being National Spoke person of INC to joining a regional party which don't even have a proper post of spoke's person. She is not getting any ticket from SS in this election. Even if she gets MLA ticket in the next election, SS cadre will not support her. There are no prominent Women leader in SS and that is because of their feudal mindset. Besides she is from UP. Sometimes I think I do not understand politics at all. Good for her. She wasn't given the due importance in the party anyway because of inter politics within her own party. Her [tweet](https://twitter.com/priyankac19/status/1119130478626271232) including the resignation letter. I used to like her. The way she put her argument and how she was always trying to fight for the right and seemed like someone trustable. I admired her for leaving Congress for supporting her harassers but now after joining Shiv Sena, I don't know how true that harassment story is and the garb of caring for others and minorities and stuff is definitely up. Just watched Tashkent Files...

This woman says Congi reinstated goons while Joining SS. Next is what? Leaving SS by saying SS is full of Xenophobia and joining MNS??? Joining Shiv Sena? LFMAO

This is why I don't take Hindustanis seriously when they talk about secularism. Both Congress and BJP cannot survive without the marginalisation of minorities. One threatens while the other patronises. Not surprising that most BJP MPs were once with the Congress. Well done.

Joining Shivsena is just to remain active in media and politics., For sure she is going to join BJP in coming years.

Seriously. We churn out probably a thousand films every year; when was the last time you saw an Indian film about our soldiers in WWI or WWII? India isn't Japan or France.

""*USA drops nukes in JAPAN""*               **World:** Fuck 'Merica! always attacking other countries. \*sympathy with japan\*.

""Recent terrorist attack in France"" **World:** Let's stand with France, we must stand against Islamic invasion in europe...

""People straved to death in Haiti""  **World:** Look! they're eating mud, it's meme material, fuckin commies.

""Pol pot kills million in cambodia""  **World:** So this dude was cambodian hitler.

Western people care less about the past or present of third world countries. I'm sorry if I'm stating something wrong, but isn't the India Gate a memorial to the Indian WW1 soldiers?

I mean if arguably one of the most iconic  monuments in Delhi, the capital, is a World War 1 memorial, then what gives?

At least the situation of WW1 veterans of India doesn't seem so bad, as the vets of the Korean, Vietnam or Iraq/Afghanistan/all these Arab countries wars in USA. I mean the Vietnam vets were downright hated for their services by most of the citizens , left wing peace activists and hippies. And while there are so many iconic Vietnam films that tell about the stories of the war, the Korean war is long forgotten.

I mean Indian sepoys have fought in South Africa as a part of the Boer wars as well, there are so many things the mainstream overlooks in history . The west legit don't care about us It's not even thought to us in our own education. I find this interesting as a Canadian.",2019-07-21 16:42:05

This! I can't understand why BJP supporters ignore this. You got it wrong OP, not saying you got it wrong about Varun but you are wrong about dynasties.

Dynastic politics is absolutely bad. That doesn't mean that Tendulkar's son Arjun should quit cricket. If Arjun is a deserving cricketer he gets a chance, not because of his dad but because of his effort. 

Dynastic politics is bad only because people get their place from influence, if thats not the case then it's fine. 

In Varun's case, he is not getting votes because he is a Gandhi, he is getting votes because of BJP/Modi. Also his dad wasn't a PM, his mom wasn't a fake PM. That's a huge difference between him and RaGa. But there is nothing inherently bad about dynasties. It is ones that continue to thrive despite dysfunction and failure that truly affect people negatively. The Patnayak dynasty in Odisha was immensely successful. YSR‚Äôs dynasty is also doing a decent job election-wise in AP.

I don‚Äôt get what‚Äôs the point of vilifying dynasties per se. No political/social/commercial system is completely free of dynasties. These systems are rooted in experience gained through mentor-mentee relationships. Parents are mentors all the time. Varun Gandhi is a regular MP whereas RaGa is the party president. NaMo, Shah, Rajnath, Jaitly, Sushma, none of them are Dynasts. When you become the next BJP chief minister just because your father was the chief minister then call me. It is not so easy in BJP Its funny how people equate kids joining their parents profession ( prevalent everywhere ) to a party run by the whim of an authoritarian family.

 The reality is  indians don't take Rahul seriously.

 Congress should have chosen other  face for their party. Sadly there are no points for second place. Congress needs to reinvent itself to be relevant,. We need more senior educated workers to come to the forefront and take the lead from the Gandhis. Religion based politics will fail one day. On that day we need a stronger Congress ready to rebuilt and take India forward. The sad reality is Congress is Gandhi family and Gandhi family is Congress. The moment Gandhis say we will step down from active politics then Congress will cease to exist. 

Irony is Gandhis nahi toh Congress will fragment into so many pieces that collecting them will be useless. 

I kinda felt during the 2019 election campaigning that Congress is not looking for the win but trying to revive the party from its 44 MP seats so that it can be on a strong foothold in 2024 elections. 

They started bit late squandering the first couple of years but demonetisation onwards they started to pick pace but they stuck too much time to Chowkidar chor hai and rafale rather than ground issues such as employment, farmer distress, etc. 

Congress didn't want to raise Pulwama and not do any politics but ultimately it was something BJP milked the cow dry on it.

well to all the anti-Modi people..

Ah Shit! Here we go again! RaGa did an alright job in the last few months. However, he was too late to the party. 

Now to defeat Thanos congress might need Priyanka Gandhi as the front and center of the 2024 campaign. That woman can speak! And a misogynistic party like BJP need to be defeated by a woman to show them their place. I will call 2024 as Thanos's endgame from the hands of congress. 2019 was not the year. They all were too late. When Priyanka joined in Jan, she took the headlines for a month before BJP had to do pulwama to take all the attention away. After that, there has been no looking back for BJP.

Congress needs to be a great opposition for the next 5 years to be relevant or this is the end of the road for them.

Economists generally aren't fond of free college https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/26/468298576/economists-on-candidates-proposals-mostly-bad

You can even go to r/Askeconomics (they provide sources and if comments don't have sources , they get removed) to ask about what economists think of free college

It's not that free college is a bad idea . Economists favor making college free only for the poor and not the rich . 

However there are alternative policies that are just as good for example Australia . 

Most of their universities are public which is why they are so cheap and prices don't inflate much  . Plus they have HECS loan system , Where you can get a zero interest loan and you only have to start paying it if you're earning above a certain threshold and if you don't then you don't need to make any payment and you have the peace of mind that your loan obligations will expire eventually . Though many loans might not be paid back and might be forgiven by the taxpayer . That's fine because it's cheaper than universal programs

Even if your income reaches that threshold where you have to make payments of that loan . It'll only be 4 or 8 % of your income . This should be seen as graduate tax imo 

So not free college but really close to it . Economists favor those policies over free college . It doesn't make sense to make college free given that the personal  return on investment is high on a college degree . However public subsidies can still exist like the Aformentioned system

Forgiving everyone's student loans isn't exactly rooted in good economics 

However that's not to say the good welfare policies can't exist.  The aformentioned one is  close to free college. Economists tend to prefer economically progressive policies over universal this and Universal that and also don't like  stupid proposals like   privatising everything 

Universal healthcare is widely supported though Ooh! AoC & Bernie.,, you need to delve a little deeper into US politics. Start with Ted Cruz, Rand Paul, Paul Ryan... Kanhaiya maybe..?

Why is beef only related to muslims? There are hindus who eat beef, there are chritians and there r other people from backward castes as well. This is just a political game for divide and rule India is not a theocracy, yet. A lot of these people actually think that eating cow meat is disrespecting their religion. How hard is it to understand that not everyone  considers the cow to be sacred? Absolutely ridiculous. What kind of idiotic article is this?

First of all. Calling for beef ban is regressive and implementation of upper caste food habits on others.

And for communal harmony. That reason is idiotic because beef is not the only way muslims are being attacked. Muslims are being made to chant jai shri ram. It's an issue of Hindutva supremacy.

And why are they calling for central ban? In South beef is openly available. Even though beef is banned in karnataka, nobody implements it. Cows were slaughtered for bakrid and I didn't see any objection. Common people don't really care unless groups like bajrang dal try to stir shit. Why are they trying to implement cow belt nonsense everywhere in India?

Some clerics in North india may have asked for people to not eat beef because of violence. Don't take that and generalize to all of Indian muslims.

And lol at them giving examples from pre independent India to support their central beef ban nonsense. I was wondering who could treat muslims as a monolithic entity while claiming that they want a ban on cow slaughter, till I reached the end. Observer research foundation. That's who. I see an attempt at claiming that the ban demand is really about the environment, and not just religion, being made by some lawyer in the article. I wonder if he wants a complete milk ban. Short of that, slaughter ban increases green house gases production, as many more cattle than the milk producers have to be kept alive and producing methane.

In the long run, of course, the cow slaughter ban only guarantees indian cows will go extinct as they become uneconomical, and are replaced with buffaloes which can be slaughtered for meat when not producing milk. No net change for the environment.",2019-08-18 05:12:46

Is minority appeasement politics to blame here?,11,cp8xyy,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cp8xyy/increasingly_polarized_political_opinions_in/,34,"[Please remember this is my personal opinion. I am open for counter arguments and honestly hoping that I am wrong as I would like for things to be better]

Hi,
I've been wondering about this for some time. The Indian voter had become increasingly politically polarized in recent times. Many would attribute this to the rising right wing in the country. But I believe the rise of right wing in recent time is linked to rising resentment in the majority Hindu population with the invearse in minority appeasement politics in the other mainstream parties.

Democracy works best when parties campaign on generic issues on the forefront. This leads to voters voting for the party with the best manifesto. Voters are not loyal to one party and will vote for they opposition if the current ruling party messes up.

But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group? Humans are instinctively selfish creatures and tbh if a party promises something specific to me or my community, I would vote for them. Keep doing this and you generate a messaiah subject relation with the voters, and the respective community becomes faithful to your party. This might be enough to sway the total votes to your favour, given the majority is still divided.

With time, the public is increasingly divided and hostile to other parties as it is now either their party (with the specific benefits promised) or the others, which do nothing for you. 

This has carved up the voter base in India into distinct sections voting only for freebies or specific policies which only affect them, even at the expense of others.

Do you guys think this is an issue in current times? 

If yes how does politics go back to the way it was before? Why would a party running on appeasing a specific community give it up when this doesn't give them any benefits?

I believe the rise of the BJP can be related to this too. With regards to my relatives living in UP, they will now not vote for SP or BSP in any situation as this will only lead to development of ""other"" people and believe BJP is the only way to get their voice heard. Given that my relatives are conservative hindus, and with them being the majority, how will other parties ever win, given that they have lost the majority votes to a party doing minority appeasement, only this time, it is for the majority.",unvital_archduke," What minority appeasement you talking about? There was no minority appeasement (as Sachar committee report clearly showed) , and development is not a zero-sum game between groups. That minority appeasement leads to or has lead to majority impoverishment/extinction is a propaganda invention of hindutva not proved by any economic or census data. Since it was empty propaganda to start with, there is nothing to go back to. This is an opinion post. Kind of like a change my mind. I am not proposing new agendas, just looking for suggestions to fixing some of the issues related to increasing polarized political opinions Yes I think one of the major reason for the rise of BJP is hate for Congress and its Dynasty type ruling. Modi was elected as there was no one else to lead. 
The day we have anyone as good as modi, people will forget Modi and move on to the next one. Real-life in Karnataka:   When I was doing my BE. Normal peoples tuition fees with merit were 50k INR per year.

Sc/STs were around 25k INR.

(Christians its more than Sc/St I think not sure about this.)

Muslims its 0 INR.

This is not based on the economy of the family. Just religion.


We all wrote Entrance exam in Karnataka above fees is only who got seats in the merit-based system. But merit rank is not the same for everyone. even there Muslims/Sc/ST had reservations.

I don't what else you can call it other than minority appeasement.



Most of the temple comes under devasom board in Kerala. Temples cant use its own money from devotees as they want. it all goes to Govt. then govt. decides salaries of priest etc...

SO net flow of money from Hindu institutions is always negative(Temples I Know its more than 25% loss)

No such things for mosques or churches.


These things really hurt the sentiments of everyday local people. 

If you want secular country Govt, Should treat all religious institutions same, no extra provisions. Just like the US.

I personally think it is not bad if Govt is leaning towards Hindu(Since it is native to India, not an invasive ideology) institutions in India, cause most of ""Secular"" Europe leans towards Christianity. Not to mentions middle east. This is a global phenomenon now. It‚Äôs a backlash against way too much overt political correctness. > But what if one party starts providing benefits specifically to one Minority/ group?

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is‚Äìought_problem No, it's mainly the incredibly efficient RSS/BJP propaganda machine that is responsible for the situation we see today. But that certainly was not possible by-itself, the opposition failed miserably and offered no resistance. The thing is, Right-wing populism is the easiest thing to sell.

Exit polls can be reliable but they too sometimes fail to capture the mood of the people. I have no faith left in majority of India's voters.

/r/blunderyears Never got a reply though If you are still interested you should look into Youth In Politics by IPAC.

They conduct programmes in colleges and educate the youth about how to get into politics.  He would get an automated reply and then a template about it later. Should've ended with 'pls reply or else I'll approach rival party' Damn you are lucky having 10lakhs for further studies.
 You could do what you like career wise, make a name for yourself through your work and then try to enter politics. Since you have some sort of base, Political parties (PP) would be more willing to take you in as you would be able to bring in votes. 

If you are an absolute nobody then why will a PP take you in as an MLA/MP ? They will ask you join as a volunteer. If you really want to be a MP/MLA then they would ask you for money. After all, you are bringing in no benefit (votes) to the party. Think of it as admission to a college, if you do not qualify through exam, i.e earn a seat through merit, then you'll have to give ""donation"" for your seat. 

If you're really serious about a political career I would suggest beginning through some sort of social work. Most of the great leaders of the Independence movement began their careers through some form of social work. This was either directly through organizing peasant/worker demands for better working conditions or fighting social evils or indirectly such as legal help in courts or spreading education.

Or you could pursue a professional career and make a name. You could join the civil services, become an IAS, do good work build a base in a district and then join politics. You could become an engineer or researcher, build/invent/discover something, make a name for yourself and then join politics. 

If you directly wish to enter politics now, you would join a PP as a worker of the party and the chances of climbing the ranks to become a MP/MLA are low since there are so many like you. Instead join politics by fighting for the political rights of the weaker sections, build a base and then join a PP.

P.S- YES I SAID PP

P.P.S- If you want a reply it would be better idea to send the msg on twitter than email. You are over qualified Kid  Do people not proofread their emails? anyone who asks how to be a politician cant be a politician! Lol IS THIS REAL !?

Regarding fake news, you could join a fact checking site like [Factly](https://factly.in/careers/). Or you could become an RTI activist. 

To discuss policies, if you're into IT/Business you could explore creating an Indian version of [Change a view](https://changeaview.com/cav/posts) built by the folks at /r/changemyview and recently [shared by Obama] (https://np.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/bj2t51/barack_obama_shares_five_articles_in_a_facebook/). Something which allows discussion and debate instead of user driven answers (Quora) or popular comments (Reddit) Independent journalism. There's a lot of people who took this approach. Paurush Sharma started from scratch and now has over 100K subs on YouTube. I have been watching his videos since he had less than 5K subs. All this happened within a span of a couple of months or so.

Once you gain some traction and politicians start recognizing you, you can jump into it Probably get on twitter and start replying to people of high stature to get recognised. Have a youtube channel and a facebook page. It is easier now due to social media. Select a small regional party and post in support of them. It would be better if the party doesn't have a clear ideology. So, if you help them to form some ideologies you would get promoted soon. Politics is a popularity contest within a geographically defined target audience. 

&#x200B;

How do you score well in such a contest?

&#x200B;

\- By targeting the people in the *geographically defined* audience (not by becoming a youtube star across a geographically broad audience in a narrow socioeconomic stratum)

\- 100% people in that constituency should know you by name

\- At least 35% people in that constituency should consider you a *useful* person to their self-interest (not knowledgeable)

\- At least 50% of people in that constituency *like* you positively

\- Make strategic alliances with people in power.

\- Make strategic alignments with the large groups in the constituency, may be on business, caste, religious or other lines. Various groups of people in that constituency should consider your interests aligned to theirs.

\- Work on your public persona, including voice, looks etc

\- arrange for some war chest of funds, everything costs money

&#x200B;

Use these to first build a base, then you can do the ""right"" things later on. The best politicians have an unassailable home constituency. That allows them to take anti-majority liberties without always being too conscious. You can't do this until you can get in power, but if you don't have any connections and don't have money and can't scare people, then you can't directly get into politics. At your age, you focus on studying then getting a good job. Once you have job, responsibilities, family you will be a mature person who understands how society works. Then you can get into politics.

Politics,"We are the nation of Sardar Patel, of Pandit Nehru, of Mahatma Gandhi, of Lal Bahadur Shastri, of Indira(with all her shortcomings), of PV Narsimha Rao, of the great Vajpayee. How did we come to Sonia, Rahul, and to Amit Shah, and Modi?",62,b4t1vr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4t1vr/we_are_the_nation_of_sardar_patel_of_pandit_nehru/,53,"I was watching many many videos from yesteryears and listening to these stalwarts itself gives the goosebumps. All these leaders had shortcomings, something that is natural of human beings.But, these were individuals so scholarly.  These folks had the intellectual capacity take on any questions and speak coherently. After listening to them and to their biography and I am saddened at the current crop of national leaders. Really saddened.

&#x200B;

Saw a news article of how Vajpayee credited Rao for the Nuclear tests. Can we imagine Modi crediting anything to previous governments ? or anyone in the current opposition doing anything similar if they come to power!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;",forcraigslist1," They are dead now. We talk about the alives.  We are the same nation. We have realised that India doesn't grow because of politicians but inspite of them. They aren't so important anymore and because they lost their importance, their shortcomings are highlighted more than their predecessors. We are always led to believe that nothing ever works. I don‚Äôt like the current state of journalism and media, the discourse has gotten to a low point. Didn‚Äôt expect it to be this bad tbh.  The times they are a changin. bcz in that era there was struggle for independence, current regime had nothing to fight for everything was gifted to them and hence taken for granted. When situation is tough , you get molded by it . Now its all politics and hidden agenda where nations priorities takes last place thats why this situataion  We are the people responsible for it. Past always seems better than it is.  Manmohan saved the country at least twice from immediate impending disaster - once in 1991 (LPG) and again in 2008 (Kasab, by not going to war). Don't forget we successfully dodged two major global financial crises - 1997 and 2008 Everyone looks at the past and thinks there are great leaders there. We spent 40+ years in an economic disastrous policy. We should have changed course in 10 years but many people still think state socialism is the the greatest thing since sliced bread.  After few decades, depending on the govt in power these current netas will be portrayed in great honor in the school textbook. Pretty interesting how you can disregard the shortcomings of Indira Gandhi (who came closest to becoming a dictator) but can call out Sonia, Rahul, Amit Shah and Modi. 

In any case, intellectual capacity is not the unit if measurement nor a requirement for the post of PM. It's their ability to connect to the masses. Most of these people have that, whether you like it or not. Modi in particular gives pretty powerful speeches (in Hindi) that are actually well crafted. 

It's also funny how nearly everyone brings up Vajpayee to claim some sort of neutrality in their assessment but he was voted out despite his relatively successful term.  What's wrong with Sonia ,Rahul ,Amit ,Modi ? We have a tendency to glorify people and events of the past.

Just because the leaders you listed are of the past doesn't make them all stalwarts. For example, Shastri was not a stalwart, although he was a good person and a good PM for a brief period.  Indira Gandhi was the original dictator. She was the prototype of Modi. As for Narsimha Rao, if there is anything good is to be said of him, it's his decision of liberalisation of the Indian economy. His choice of Manmohan Singh as FM must be commended, too. But he is, above all, one of the wiliest politicians India has ever seen. He was not a mass leader. He was a Congress party apparatchik.

Now for Vajpayee. On what basis is he being lauded now? Yes, he is less despicable than Modi, agreed. But here was a man who allowed the Gujarat pogrom to happen, and, even more egregiously, made the most callous remark about the cause of the pogrom. This man, like Modi, was only good for ornate speeches. Nothing else, nada. For some reason, he and Kalaam are the most overestimated, hyped leaders of the past.

Now for the most glaring remark in your post - Sonia Gandhi. Mrs. Gandhi decided to stay away from politics after her husband's death. Understandably traumatised not just by her husband's death but the way he was assassinated, although the party leadership was hers for the asking, and later, presumably, the PM post. In her place, Rao ruled for 5 years. At the end of it, he didn't leave the Congress party smelling of roses.

Meanwhile, the Congress party was ruled by all kinds of people. Sitaram Kesri was the nadir. Pundits had written off Congress as a has-been force in Indian politics.

It was at this time that so-called regional satraps like Arjun Singh, Chithambaram, Anthony etc. queued outside 10, Janpath, beseeching her to enter politics. It was due to their compulsion that she agreed.

The rest is truly historic. She was the opposition leader in the next Vajpayee government. She formed the government in 2004. A Indian woman of Italian origin was voted by the Indian people. Truly remarkable. The people didn't vote for Manmohan Singh (who was not even in the reckoning) or Scindia or anyone else. They voted for Sonia Gandhi. Let's fucking admit it. She turned around the Congress party from the lows of 1997 to form the government in 2014. Let's give credit where it is due. And was she a one act wonder? No, she won again in 2009. Some critics may say it was due to the incumbency factor, just the same way they say that Vajpayee lost the 2004 elections due to anti-incumbency. Whatever fuck, it was a good government. She won again, and, alas, floundered.

Meanwhile, Modi's propaganda had started. Everyone from Motilal Nehru to Indira Gandhi's parentage was fabricated. I even read some shit about how Indira Gandhi's bloodline was of, wait for it, Timurlane! Anyway, the propoganda worked. That's why people of certain ilk and of certain generation seems to think Sonia Gandhi's two successful terms - let's admit it was she people voted for - as some sort of a fluke. That's why people fail to mention the remarkable feat of only the third leader in Indian history, after Nehru and Indira Gandhi, to win back to back general elections to form the govt.

I admit I have left out many moles and warts from this ""glowing"" account. Feel free to add it, but take away not the remarkable aspect, too. Was there corruption? Yes, in oodles. Was there backroom buying and selling of votes of opportunistic parties, such as Mulayam Singh's? Yes, in buckets.

Yet we must admit that it is indeed remarkable that a late, reluctant entrant to Indian politics; of Italian-origin, and a woman, made a complete turnaround in the fortunes of India's oldest political party within 5 years. And it is remarkable not only of her but of the Indian people, who, unlike some richer, more democratic, more educated nations, didn't think her gender or place of birth important when voting for her.

&#x200B; the leaders which you have mentioned as inspiring , were formed during the indian struggle for independence , they could have their difference is their approach , but they did want India as a nation to improve. since politics at that time was largely a reserve of educated and rich , as a corollary to that they did not appeal to lowest of human emotions namely religoin, caste and class issues, and issues of education , infrastructure and health were used to fight politics .

Once that generation died down , the coming generation didn't have the moral values which come with living in the time of fighting for your nation, to win elections they resort to most common issues which everybody can relate to,i.e religion and caste.

&#x200B;

this situation has gotten worse , with every middle class parents advice to their children that do whatever you want but don't join politics or don't do social work  , just get a good job, house and get married 

&#x200B;

Seriously what do people think will change , with this kind of attitude?

&#x200B;

&#x200B; Vajpayee was a traitor that provided information to the British. He also was the biggest contributor to the attack on Babri Masjid after Advani.


Edit: For people that dont beleive me - Research who Liladhar Bajpai was and how the written testimony given by Vajpayee and his brother put this freedom fighter in jail. People always get the leaders they deserve. Indira Gandhi was by far the worst PM of them all, and that includes both Rajiv Gandhi and Modi. Nehru ssly?

F. Did he finish the novel? Life is just a series of events, you are not really in control of these events. People may say you can control these through hard work, perseverance, work ethic etc etc, but the outcomes are also a result of the times.

Don't take success and failure too seriously. The guy wrote a graphic novel:

> In the graphic novel, The Superhero Journals, set in Charles‚Äôs hometown of Varanasi, four teenagers-turned-superheroes take on a corrupt, vengeful state administration controlled by a masked, mystic religious figure‚Äîa yogi of sorts‚Äîwho brands them ‚Äòterrorists‚Äô and ‚Äòanti-nationals‚Äô and orchestrates a manhunt. Read the article. Has nothing much to do with politics. An design student (MDes)  took his own life after failing to get a job, while complaining of grades slump in latter half of 2nd  year.

That he drew a graphic novel etc is just an aside. I asked to myself

What talent means

What do you want to prove so much for?

I work hard

Isn't talent is hardwork or am I wrong.


Then what went so wrong

Why not it showed result

For what else am i living for

For whom I am fighting, why am I comparing

Why am I alive ???






Isn't my result good enough, isn't my life worth living.

Isn't my struggle wasted if I die.

Isn't my friends are there for me, 

It's fine if I am medium, why... Because I have not lost, I had not given up, I am still alive. I never understood why people want to kil themselves.

If you wanna die, you obviously don't give a shit about anyone. Even your loved ones, cause you're hurting them. No one loves you ? Then you don't have anyone to give a shit about.

I say, get out of the normal life, go on an adventure. Leave the country, do something thrilling. Like track down a terrorist, kill a corrupt politician, save a spotted deer from hunters, fight a bear, fuck a prostitute; get STDs. What are you afraid of ? You had a 100% death rate before, these aren't worse than that.

Why waste your one shot at consciousness on something so unimaginably boring trivial things.

I don't know how to water this down, but FUCK anyone who commits suicide. 

World doesn't owe you anything, world will not be just with you. People around you won't alive in 100 years and neither do you. For god's sake, LIVE your life to the fullest.",2019-07-16 21:06:44

**India top-ranked country in mobile data consumption: Amitabh Kant** 

 ______ 
NEW DELHI: Lending a testimony to Indians' romance with mobile internet
consumption,

Niti Aayog

CEO (chief executive officer)

Amitabh Kant

, on Wednesday, tweeted that India has become ""world's no 1

mobile data

consuming country."" The tweet further said that,""It's(India) mobile data
consumption is higher than USA &amp; China's mobile data consumption put
together.""

> Amazing! With 150 cr gigabytes per month of mobile data consumption India is
now world's no 1 mobile data consuming... https://t.co/PnE4ihLdxo

>

> ‚Äî Amitabh Kant (@amitabhk87) 1513908042000

Kant however, did not quote any source for the information.

In the recent past, India has witnessed a surge in mobile data consumption,
mainly with the introduction of

Reliance Jio

, which further led to competition in data plans among telecom companies.
Earlier this year, Reliance Industries chairman

Mukesh Ambani

had also claimed India's numero uno position in mobile data usage adding,"" Jio
users consumed more than 100 crore GB of data per month on the Jio network and
that's more than 3.3 crore GB a day.""

Earlier this week, a report released by investment firm Omidyar network
provided an insight to Indians' nature of mobile data use. The report claimed
that an average mobile internet user in India spends almost 70 per cent of the
time on apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, and music and entertainment apps.
This is much more than by people in the US, who visit these apps for only 50
per cent of the time they spend on the mobile phone. It further said that on
an average, a user in India spends 200 minutes a day on mobile apps, lower
than the US average of 300 minutes a day.

 LOL news of the day. I considered python to be most useful language for scientific research. in b4 'we invant' True. Just like Urdu is important for space travel. 
/s Phir shuru ho gaye bhencho. Yeh saaley thaktey nahin hein is sab chutiyappe se? Bas karo maaiyavon... Rajnath Singh, and other such idiots in the BJP, should just shut the fuck up. Winning elections doesn't give them a right to spew their ignorance on all and sundry matters. Lol. Chutya saala I doubt if he can even speak 1 word of Sanskrit  I wish I could conduct sanskrit exam all these fellas ! The single most important trait for science and technology is free flow of information. ""I see further because I stand on the shoulder of giants"".

Sanskrit will hugely disrupt this (there are hundreds of thousands of journals and preprint servers); the world is not beating down our doors to learn sanskrit to publish their theses.

Moving S&T to Sanskrit would therefore be a massively retrograde step for India.   Someone should ask this idiot: since Sanskrit is so useful to Science, Mr Singh, can you develop the necessary science to provide some scientific validation of this claim? [deleted] OMG, what a chutiya ?  I charge my mobile using ""Sanskrit'. Wish he had usefully made his speech in Sanskrit; with all reporting in Sanskrit. Then we could ignore him more. [deleted] Scientific Method most useful for science, technology, actual scientists say. 

Yes, I know he was a physics lecturer. That makes this statement all the more unfortunate. 

Sanskrit / Panani's grammar were pioneering and inspired the likes of Chomsky to advance linguistics (later used for designing programming languages) - but it's not the most important component of science.   Sanskrit is a great language, but instead of making pointless statements like this, or attending meetings advocating cow protection, Rajnath could actually try and focus on his job. As someone who initially had great hopes on this government, I am confused as to where the priorities of this government currently lie. Says the guy who has credibility on this subject ..which is an Urban Legend/hoax. This guy is the Minister for Home Affairs.. Mutherfucker write a compiler in Sanskrit. I dare you. I double dare you. How the fuck did he get a Masters in Physics without understanding what science is? wut. As long as you can get your ideas across unambiguously, what does it matter what language you use? ITT, redditors who probably cannot even speak their mother tongue properly, decide to shit on ancient language - because they cannot use that language to lay bitches. 

 Advocating the promotion of Sanskrit, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said even foreign scholars have considered it to be one of the most scientific of languages.

Sanskrit is an exceptional language as it is an artificially created language (Sam + Krita which means Completely Done or Completely Made)....While Sanskrit is undoubtedly better than most of the existing languages in many linguistic aspects it might not be that suitable for S & T, a single word in Sanskrit can have multiple meanings depending on the context of the sentence, thus making it ambiguous & unsuitable for S & T... This ambiguous nature is also one of the reasons why many S&T things remained hidden in disguise of shlokas & mantras. No it isnt'!!!

Science/Technology,What are the options for part-time undergraduate courses in science/technology for a bright student going through hard times,9,918ek7,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/918ek7/what_are_the_options_for_parttime_undergraduate/,3,"I'm not sure how much detail is too much detail, but here's the story:

A few years ago, I was volunteering at a Government school teaching Mathematics and I had a student who is very good at maths and a step above the rest of his peers. He was keen on studying and quick at math. He is hands down one of the best students I had the opportunity to teach. 2 years ago, I was glad to learn that he got into IIIT for it's 6 year integrated program on a scholarship. He comes from a very poor family whose daily wage is few hundred rupees a day on the days they go to work, and he is the only one in his family pursuing studies beyond class X. His hostel campus is about 200 kms away from his home and he finished his +2. 4 more years to go.

However, as fate had it, just last week, his elder brother passed away. Obviously, his entire family is shook and is still recovering. During the rites, not sure if it was his mother or the ""elders"", the paranoia kicked in and it is his mother's and the majority of the ""edlers"" wish now, that he drop his education and support his elderly mother by starting to work as unskilled labor. He is however ""allowed"" to pursue any open degree or a degree at a local college while continuing to work, which I still count as a silver lining. The family is also in debt, so, according to their thinking, they cannot afford their only remaining son pursuing a degree for 4 years at this time.

Absolutely preposterous move, but this isn't unprecendented from families with very low income and very little or no education. Since they are in hard times, I will refrain from the bashing.

As I see it, there are two options. First, is to persuade the mother to let him continue his studies in IIIT so his future is better. A few of their educated kin have advised this to the mother, but I was told the advice fell on deaf ears, understandably so. His classes are starting this week and given his brother passed away only a few days ago, the timing is really bad. Plus, leaving the mother alone at this time also sounds horrible. 

The second option, is to give in to his mother's wishes, stay at home, go to work and pursue study part time. I talked to my student on phone. He is confused and torn, because like I said, he is keen on studying, but also wants to be there for his mother during the hard times. His mother and most of the ""family"" insisting that he go to work isn't really helping. Given that this is almost the end of July, most of the colleges have finished their admissions and he is worried about wasting an year. 

In IIIT, he chose Electronics as his major and he is very keen on pursuing a career in technology. I can vouch for him that he is ambitious and puts in the required work. It would be a shame if his talent/potential goes to waste due to the harrowing situation he found himself in.   I will try my best that he pursues the first option, however, reality is reality and he needs to be prepared for the worst. Given that he will work 48 hours a week and will have the rest of the time to pursue a degree, what are his options in terms of universities/colleges that are still open for admission and will let him pursue a degree part time(the closer to science/tech, the better)? Are there such programs for under-graduation? What are his other options?

Additonal details: His mother stays in Hyderabad, so, universities and colleges nearby are preferred. His mother works as a cobbler and moving to another place is not an option(IIIT Basara is at a remote place and he has to stay in the hostel if he has to pursue the degree). His current college will give a +2 certificate for admissions in a different college. He is turning 18 in a few weeks, but abandoning his mother at this time is not looking likely, unless she comes around after we persuade and is prepared for the hardship. Neither options are easy :(

Please keep the comments constructive. I wrote this in a hurry, so, my apologies if I sound crass.

**TL;DR: Which Universities/Colleges in/near Hyderabad provide option for part time study for a degree related to tech/science?** ",kasam_se," why not start a gofundme campaign for the debt ?. Then may be his mother can manage for few months and meanwhile the student can pick up a part time job? I feel the best option here is:

- The student should move out of hostel and rent a house near his college.
- The mother should move in with her son here.
- Funds should be raised to support the expenses of both.
- As they are from an impoverished family, I am sure they know how to make do with whatever amount they have. 
- If the mother wants to work, I am sure the college too could be convinced to hire her as a temporary worker.

The mother just wants to feel secure and be with her son. This is the best way to go about it without disrupting his study. 

If you are not able to convince them, involve the educated community elders of the students family to speak with his family to let the boy pursue his education. As finance is the major concern, show them proof of how much their son can earn once he graduates. Find out their political preference, and involve the local leader (preferably elected official) of whatever party they like to talk with the family to further pressurise them. You need to find who has the most influence on the family and try to understand their concern and offer uitable solutions to convince them. 

And thank you for having such concerns for your student - our country is the better for it due to people like you. ",2018-07-24 05:44:13

Modi government has invited anyone with experience in  in law, science and technology, social service, management, journalism, mass-media or administration and governance. 

This is the first time appointment of CIC is not based on seniority and based on merits.


DOPT  Circular - http://ccis.nic.in/WriteReadData/CircularPortal/D2/D02rti/4_7_2014_CIC-IR.pdf This is a good start. The current government has moved away from a seniority based appointment (earlier the senior most Information Commissioner was appointed the Chief) to an based appointment on application merit. Both processes have their own pros and cons.

However, there also seems be a road block. The [appointment process for a CIC](http://cic.gov.in/information_commissions.htm#19.) is done by a committee that includes the Prime Minister, one Union Cabinet Minister nominated by PM and the Leader of Opposition. We do not have a LoP as yet and any attempt to appoint one without the LoP may be viewed as a subversion of the process and therefore, unconstitutional. OR may be politically, we will soon see a LoP appointed. [**@OnlineRTI**](https://twitter.com/OnlineRTI):

[Survey],12,27alsc,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/27alsc/how_satisfied_are_you_with_your_childs_exposure/,35,"I am interested in what /r/india parents (and even others) think about the quality of their child's exposure to STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics).  Please help me by answering a short survey here: [http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U](http://www.instant.ly/s/QsV3U).

I'll post the results of this survey here on /r/India in a few days.

Disclosure: I am with an NGO committed to improving the quality of STEM exposure in India.  We will use your responses to guide our future activities.  You can learn more about us through our first activity --- a science fair in Bangalore --- here [http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/](http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/)",happy_elephant," From what I hear in India, there is literally zero exposure to scientific thinking; the more options are made to rote learning and puking back content in exams, than understanding. 

Problem? funding. Most of the schools / colleges have to keep cost low and apparatus as old as 1947 are there. 

Alternative: Make math and science fun. No, computers/ laptops/phones do not count in learning - they serve as more of games or entertainment than the real thing.  Not a parent, but we need more exposure to critical and rational thinking. The amount of people that immediately believe bogus chain mails and forwards is staggering. Just think people. Frankly, I don't see too many Indian parents particularly interested in their kid's education until they reach college.  Particularly parents who are in business and wealthy.

school jata hain.  fail nahin hota hai.  haan theek hain.  baad main kyaa hogaa dekhaa jayegaa.  abhi aur kaam hain.  business hi to karega.  padhne main zyada kuch nahin hain. I wish Indian media paid more attention to quality of education in India.  To begin with, shouldn't we have rankings of high schools and colleges in India.  India Today does some work on this, but given our population and the number of schools and colleges don't we need better quality, and comprehensive rankings. >here http://www.escapevelocityfair.com/

I support you..very nice initiative.

but..isko escape velocity nahi bolna tha..you know there's special joke of this on r/India. Don't Indian kids already have an overdose of science and academics?  You should be working to expose them to more sports and arts and literature. Your website is really ordinary.  

How much does it cost to get a really high quality website made?  50k? 

Surely you can afford that much money.",2014-06-05 04:13:28

> THE FACTS
> 
> * Originally from India and Pakistan, Basmati became a controversial ‚Äòissue‚Äô after RiceTec, a Texas-based company, in 1997, patented some types of rice they developed as ‚ÄúAmerican basmati‚Äù.
> * RiceTec Inc, had been trying to enter the international Basmati market with brands like ‚ÄúKasmati‚Äù and ‚ÄúTexmati‚Äù. Ultimately, the company claimed to have developed a new strain of aromatic rice by interbreeding basmati with another variety. They sought to call the allegedly- new variety as Texmati or American Basmati.
> * RiceTec Inc, was issued the Patent number 5663484 on Basmati rice lines and grains on September 2, 1997.
> * This was objected to by two Indian nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) ‚Äî Centre for Food Safety, an international NGO that campaigns against biopiracy, and the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, an Indian environmental NGO who filed legal petitions in the United States. The Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research also
> objected to it.
> * They sought trade protection for basmati rice of the Indian subcontinent and jasmine rice of
> Thailand. They demanded amendment of U.S. rice standards to specify that the term ‚Äúbasmati‚Äù can be used only for rice grown in India and Pakistan, and jasmine for the Thai rice.
> * The Indian government, after putting together the evidence, officially challenged the patent in June 2000.

Science/Technology,What is the Future of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in INDIA?,5,cj7xx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cj7xx0/what_is_the_future_of_artificial_intelligence_and/,1," 

A news report published in October in The Economic Times said, ‚ÄúStart-ups witness 108% growth in funding in India in 2018.‚Äù The news report further mentioned that Artificial Intelligence was among those domains which witnessed the fastest adoption among industry sectors. **Currently, there are about 400 start-ups working on AI and machine learning domains. About $150 million dollars is invested in India‚Äôs AI sector by private players alone and the number has been growing since 2016**. Though there has been growth, India lags far behind countries like the US and China in terms of investment. With a copious pool of STEM talent and with a growing population of youngsters, India will be banking on AI for its economic growth and improvement in the quality of life of its citizens.

There are several start-ups that are based in cities such as Bengaluru, New Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad which work on artificial intelligence principles to serve consumers better. Their product range varies from multi-lingual chatbots to online shopping assistance and automated consumer data analysis

* **THE ROAD AHEAD**

The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence which was put together by the government of India through NITI Aayog sets the roadmap on how to develop AI in the country. The report points out how AI will help the country grow, what are the strengths and what are the challenges on the way. The government has identified a few areas where it thinks AI will play a crucial role as far as India is concerned

 

Capital and qualified manpower are the two main pillars that are required for the establishment and growth of any sector. India is home to a large talent pool of Science, Technology, Engineering and Math graduates. Companies such as Google, Intel and Microsoft have been offering short term training programs to computer program developers which help them upskill in the area of AI programming. On the other hand AICTE, the government body which governs and regulates professional education in India, recently added AI, IoT, Machine Learning and few other subjects as mandatory subjects in its curriculum of B.Tech programs. Changes in curriculum and content are further expected in the days to come.

Investment towards AI from private players has been increasing in India ($44 million in 2016 to $77 million in 2017). The start-ups have been working towards developing various AI-based products and services. With conglomerates having a lion‚Äôs share in India‚Äôs market, there is huge scope for AI-based enterprise solutions in the country. The increasing demand for products and services can attract more investment towards R&D in AI sector

Let me give you an example. I worked at motorcycle manufacturer in an Assistant Manager role in R&D. My job was to measure the dimensions of electrical components for new motorcycle models. And for that, I was paid more than 6 lakhs per year. 

One simple computer vision app can replace this entire job function (when I was working there, there were around 10 others who were doing the same thing, with different components)",2019-07-29 20:58:48
Science/Technology,A criticism of the New Education Policy 2019 and existent education policies,10,bwmz0o,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwmz0o/a_criticism_of_the_new_education_policy_2019_and/,6,"**Problems with respect to HECI and fee fixation :**  One of the biggest problems that the policy has done, is that it has legitimized the policy of state exit and buttressed the belief of Private Education providing Quality education. **HEFA, as has been founded by GoI in association with Canara Bank and has  a corpus of 1 lakh crore of which centre is paying only 8500 crores, puts this whole thing into perspective. The rest of the corpus is to be attained via loans, which has to be repaid by institutes over period of time. Now, indirectly asking, on whom will the institutes push over this liability of 90,000 crores? Its the students, and the pricing of courses**. While Fee fixation and allowing autonomy is welcome to an extent, but let us not fool ourselves, any HEI with half decent infra would need a fuckton of expenditure and the money has to be absorbed from the peoples pockets

&#x200B;

**A blueprint towards privatisation of Higher education.** Not a word has been spoken about Quality Assurance or the fact of Accountability fixation towards Private institutes. ASSOCHAM reports that 93% of the MBAs in our country is unemployable. ( [https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11](https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/featurephilia/story/mba-education-problems-328626-2016-07-11) ) Now lets get into this quandary. We want to privatise education without a semblance of accountability towards them really providing people quality skill upgradation. Let us look into the average unemployability, the Private college Engineer stands much worse in employability situation than the average NIT/JU/BESU (and am not even taking the better NITs and IITs and IIScs into picture). **THE WHOLE DOCUMENT PROMISES US LAVISH WORDS, MUCH PROMOTION, BUT IT SPEAKS ZILCH ABOUT WHERE THE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE RAISED FROM. In the previous year we had seen how the INSTITUTE OF EMINENCE tag was given to JIO institute. This meant that they could raise a massive 1000 crores for over 10 years , but we all know the project never even begun, how can we judge its credibility and potential. The government did away 1000 crore clause for private institutes temporarily, but there has not been any subsequent clarification on it, thus proving  the** ***crony- corporate- neta - babudom clout*** **is taking over the education system too.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**The Report clearly shows that round about 49% of the children who take up education in Class 1 do not continue it beyond Class 10.**  The policy sort of considers that  this ratio will be maintained, and we should actually place infrastructure in such a fashion that it caters and provides quality care for the 51%. Implicitly it has recognized that the rest of the 49% will not come up, and that there would be more stress towards the 51% who continue than bringing up the 49% who are exiting the net.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Fails to address the biggest issue : EMPLOYABILITY .** Take this in two parts\*\*.\*\*

&#x200B;

**Employability of the lesser skilled :** THE Present Government **SINCE 2015** has been pushing the skilling agenda. Furthermore as has been the priorities of the policy, skilling has been mandated as an important part of the DEP,2019.   It had promoted the PPP model for skilling. But the model as Sharda Prasad report has shown has failed to muster much influence. So much so that 99.5% of the skilling units are government owned. The skilling institutes are marred with **CONFLICT OF INTEREST,** Malgovernance and the credibility of their skilling quality is pretty poor, once we look into the rates of employability after completing the courses. The NSQF framework has adopted a technique of **recognition to prior learning** \- but although the skill of a layman is getting recognized, what is its effective use, if it doesnt lead to any jobs? In the above tone lets also take up the **ISSUE OF SYLLABI in VT and diploma courses. The course structure in VT is haphazard enough with its whole bouquet of courses, preventing streamlining. This means aligning the courses to international requirements, ensuring a basic foundation in the 3Rs, and life-long learning**. It implies national standards for an in-demand skill set with national/global mobility that translates into better jobs. Short duration courses (with no real skills) that provide low pay for suboptimal jobs cannot be called national standards. Hence the current national standards have to drastically improve.   Germany has only 340 courses ‚Äî in accordance with the National Classification of Occupations 2015 (which itself was based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations). Such trainees will be a national asset. **What we have instead are nearly 10,000 standards, produced mostly by consultants.** There cannot be thousands of standards (compressed into 2,000 qualification packs/job roles), and ‚Äúdelivered‚Äù to trainees in a matter of a few months. **This is not what the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) had recommended. The focus should be in strengthening reading, writing and arithmetic skills.** No skill development can succeed if most of the workforce lacks the foundation to pick up skills in a fast-changing world. Vocational training must by definition be for a minimum of a year, which includes internship (without which certification is not possible). **Short-term training should be confined to recognising prior learning of informally trained workers who are already working.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Employability of the higher skilled :** The problem of the higher skilled is sufficiently different from that of the lower skilled. Such a situation has happened due to few reasons :

1. promoting a flawed pattern of **EDUCATION FOR JOBS and MARKS**
2. Lack of requisite jobs in the sectors of choice. **Yojana in 2017 had carried out an Important little study where it matched the aspirations of students of HEI to the jobs that were prevalant across the state.** The results were near abysmal, given only few states had above 40% correlation between the jobs they were producing and the jobs that the students were demanding.
3. **Putting in a process of ""Hands On"" education and not  ""Hands free"" education.** While the government has been pushing its cause of making innovation an important part for Ranking HEIs and ranking technical institutes,and brought in a plethora of schemes to Encourage partnerships with such colleges that have a ranking of less than 200 as per QS,  the problems involving the lack of **""Hands On""** education are far more complicated than just that. It involves the problem of RoI on such innovation (credits system), the push towards Quantitative numbers (yes, more the number of papers, and not more the number of papers in journals having high impact factor), the lack of imaginativeness in our educational regime across society, all contributes to the same.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Romanticizing of Sanskrit and the past. Case in point, Bharatiya Shiksha Board.** No, we arent going to become a vishwaguru by promoting cow pee as a cancer cure. No, Bharatiya and vedic shiksha boards can never be equal to CISCE and CBSE. The skill imparted for doing astrology can only get a person to some VHP shakha, sorry it is never going to a man a job to earn a living. Promoting pseudo science in the name of TRADITION is blasphemy.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Mission Nalanda and Mission Taxila has said that there will be Higher Univ in every district,**  but there is no plan in place. The government trying to establish the fact that pushing private people to open and run univs can be good, but that will never be inclusive. **To remember all those who believe this is some new innovative plan of mudiji, the RUSA scheme and its intentions of opening HEIs across all EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD districts was present since UPA days. The present re-wrapping and calling for the Private sector gives me only a feeling of Skill India 2.0**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**ASER AND NAS reports clearly show the abysmal state of education in our primary levels. There has not been one attempt made to fix the situation,** rather than a vague policy prescription of INTERACTIVE EDUCATION. **Mid day meal and good nutrition might attract and increase the GER at entry level,** but it isnt going to solve the **LEARNING POVERTY GAP ISSUES .** Let us not fool ourselves, a country where the average class 5 to class 8 going child struggles to solve class 2 mathematics, skilling is an useless exercise. OECDs PISA report had ranked us abysmally, so much so that we withdrew participation from PISA and joined it back only this year. Economic Survey 2017 part 1 shows that the learning gap is far greater in girls wrt mathematics. In such a case solutions can be manifold. **Should we create a separate situation for girls, where they feel confident enough to take part in maths and science related activities? Studies have shown that given the Backward Upbringing that a female child often gets, combined with the fact that there is a huge Number of UNWANTED FEMALES ( Computed by metric Sex ratio of Last child) it is only expected that they would feel Underconfident than their fellow male compatriot who has better ACCESS to CARE, NUTRITION at home. The worst part of the report has been, although it has agreed time and over again about the learning poverty gap, it has ONLY PROMOTED SOME COSMETIC MEASURES LIKE FLIPPED LEARNING AND DIGITAL BOARDS.**

&#x200B;

**BRINGING UNIVS UNDER CIVIL SERVICE CONDUCT RULES.** One of the most important places of societal evolution and innovation and invention is the University. The varsity must be kept a free place, where infusion of ideas, permeability and penetration of ideas must be maximum. On the other hand, our government has left no stone unturned to bring the Univs under the ambit of CCS rules. Vide CCS rules ; A professor would not be able to openly criticize and elaborately express his dissent against a government policy in an editorial without having its approval. The problem is not just in bringing Univs under CCS, but a concealed attempt at making SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY and PROGRESS subservient to some whimsical stuff written in Ancient Textbooks. The Indian Science Congress was just a blatant attempt to push its agenda. Such vile attempts are being concealed under norms of **""PROMOTING RESEARCH IN CHOICE SECTORS"" , "" GRANTS FORWARDED TO SUCH RESEARCH THAT IS SOCIALLY VIABLE**""  and such other ambiguous terminology. (Vide schemes like IMPRESS, IMPRINT etc)

&#x200B;

**BRAIN DRAIN AND BRAIN USE .**  A wonderful opportunity lay right infront of our hands to reverse back atleast a section of brain that has been drained. Given the rise of RIGHT in USA and across many European nations, we could actually reverse and bring some of our talented brains back to our country. But for that we need a liberated education system, and a system that is ready to suitably employ such people with due remuneration. Also lets move into the issue of **BRAIN USE.** A very important issue here can be one of **social learning based methods, via ""Interested people"". Can we tap such brains, that are probably voluntarily unemployed, or maybe want a more respectable employment, and try to push them in sectors where they can impart learning to say a TRIBAL school, or maybe the average SSA school, with a honorary compensation**? We have always been crying ""HEY NO TEACHERS AND NO RESOURCE"" while we actually have resources that we arent ready to look into.

**ARE WE TRYING TO BE A GLOBAL LABOUR ECONOMY OR A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY? The whole policy has been mired with ambiguities, where it speaks of IMPROVED ACCESS, but no QUALITY IMPROVEMENT, where it speaks of ACCESS IMPROVEMENT, but doesnt really proceed to describe how it would finance, and in places where it speaks of FINANCING of HEIs it seems to forgot the margins of difference that exist between a PSU and a Govt funded HEI. Private, for profit  education has never been linked to improved access in areas of low access. What seems further is the deceit by the govt to concede an explicit percentage of society as going to be ""leftovers, since they wont continue education anyways"" , and the deceit by the govt to EXIT in a sustained manner from a section that needed greater govt involvement in the veener of ""PRIVATE EMPOWERMENT"". The push for higher fees with minimal ""restraint"" will only lead to severe EXCLUSION of the lower rungs of the MIDDLE CLASS from the advantages of HEI while buttressing the hold of the upper echelons of the 1% both ""Sociologically and systematically"".**

A total hypocrisy where we speak of inclusive education yet, we believe FOR PROFIT education will push education to the EDUCATIONALLY BACKWARD PLACES. The Vacancies in the biggest and best Institutes wrt FACULTY are being kept vacant intentionally, to show them in poor light, to the public, enabling generous privatization. Rather than being lost in dreams of how digital blackboards and play based education and a 5+3+3+4 education , which are cosmetic reforms to the real problems of POVERTY (in learning) , UNEMPLOYMENT and DEPLORABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

Science/Technology,To Redditors of Kolkata,1,bpgagr,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bpgagr/to_redditors_of_kolkata/,0,"It's not the buildings, the roads, the bridges & other concrete that make a city what it is, but the people inhabiting it. Hence, my dearest peers, knowing this city to be their home, lend me your ears.

These are dark times that we're going through. Violence. Oppression. Racism. You name it and it's what we experience, ad nauseam. Change is needed. We need it ‚Äî we demand it; and this being the season of ballot boxes & EVMs, we yearn to vote to that end. 'Tis here, I beg to differ and ask: is it really a considerable choice when we're given to choose our predators, between lions, tigers and wolves? Yes, one of them is way worse than the others & needs to be gone for everyone's good; but is empowering the other murderers any better?

For as long as I remember, our lives have been spent as slaves & serfs to these powers: the fools, bigots & goons, called politicians we elect into leaders, the banks, capitalists & industrialists we sell ourselves to and to each other, caught in their barbaric game of tag, in which we're all 'it' in the end. I want to change all of that; don't you?

They say, everything big, starts small. Hence, in a world of 7.6 billion, would it be too wrong to start with our city of 14 million, prided so much for its openness, liberalism & intellegentia? Kolkata is OUR CITY: OUR COMMONS, OUR HOME, enclosed by bigots & greedy gluttons to have created a graveyard for our dreams and for life, especially for the thousands who pour into it everyday, hoping to obtain the collectively acknowledged fictional oxygen, called money, required of us all to exist. This is no longer a city, but a corporate heath, bearing concrete in place of vegetation.

I yearn of you, hence, let's not set aside our differences on who we wish to elect, which fiction we wish to pray to and so on, but evolve our minds to move beyond such gibberish and actually work to make this city sustainable, homely, liveable, post partisanism, post market, post capitalist and really smart, not just a dumb city with proprietary wifi, that the oligarchs deem smart. Let us build, on this pyre of yesterdays' failures, a new city that truly would shower joy on all.

Considering today's problems, my wish is to take back the city into our collective hands, as our commons, manage it so, and make it thrive, not grow exponentially. Of course, when I say take back, I don't ask for a violent revolution of the ploretariat, but establishment of mutual-aid-networks & P2P Commoning practices, with each of our houses, condos, etc. being its reliable nodes. It is impossible to build such a space using current structures, such as the market (a network where people paywall goods & services to exploit each other & accumulate capital) or the state, with its systemic biases of race, religion, etc., the NGO circus standing on Corporate Social Responsibility Grants, acting as band-aids distributed by those that machine gun us, and other top-down, vertical (hierarchical) institutions. Therefore let's start here, as the Kolkata Commons Collective, a mutual-aid-network, where we organize ourselves horizontally, as equals, and work hard to produce, maintain and common the commons for us all to enjoy.

In case you think my beliefs to be Utopian and my ideas too lofty, the same was & still is thought of the knowledge commons: Wikipedia, the numerous thriving Wikis, Free & Open Source Software, especially Linux, which powers apart from the desktops of a few of us, the entire internet, all supercomputers, most phones (Android, Sailfish, Tizen), Open Source Hardware such as Arduino, Raspberry Pi, RISC V, the Wikispeed car, FOSMC bike, 3D Printers, Open Designs, Creative Commons works, Theatre Commons grouups, Cities like Seoul, Barcelona, Brussels, etc., the hackerspaces & real makerspaces (anarchist, non-profit, commons oriented ones, unlike the corporate, for-profit open washes of science museums & technical schools) coming up around the world, etc., and many more. The big question is, whether we continue our banal, servile, practically cannibalistic ways, being skeptical of our capabilities, or pitch in to prove the market-worshiping, orthodox, skeptics wrong, to liberate ourselves and eveyone else?

[Here's a nice introduction to the Commons](https://youtu.be/nsRFdBBOyzU?t=155).

In case you wonder what are these commons I so talk about, feel free to check this [6-minutes' short](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_pRS9167vk) or [24-minutes' long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_cKrcQ30518) explanations.

After that of course, let us please network & work! Here are some of my proposals ‚Äî a list to which you're more than welcome to add, via comments maybe.

Proposals:‚Äî

* Localizing our physical, economic circuits to reduce the ecological footprint & make the city resilient to calamities, both natural & artificial. The media may be glorifying Orissa on its disaster management, since Fani hit, but let's remember that huge sectors of the state are still dead, without electricity, water, etc. since being dependent on a centralized power grid system, they've no recourse but wait for the long electrical and other circuits to be connected again become functional again.
* So noting the above, creating, improving & sharing our own version of [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/)'s [Global Village Construction Set](https://www.opensourceecology.org/gvcs/gvcs-machine-index/), and establishing a network of [Hackerspaces](https://hackerspaces.org/) to start manufacturing [Glocally](http://commonstransition.org/what-is-p2p-an-introduction/) (doing the light things globally and the heavy things locally), to aid us.
* Running a web of [SOLEs (Self Organized Learning Environments)](https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/) to aid our education.
* Creating a distributed internet based on meshnet technology, using the [ESP8266](http://esp8266.net/) and similar Open Source Wireless microchips, protocols like [LoRaWAN](https://lora-alliance.org/about-lorawan) like systems, etc., to free our dependence on centralized, paid, private connection providers  we use to access the WWW and communicate. So think distributed web with [IPFS](http://ipfs.io/) & [dat](https://datproject.org/) protocols, along with garlic routed, P2P VoIP, accessible & managed as a common, without any central authority or monetary barriers.
* Manufacturing & distribution of basic phones similar to the [WiPhone](http://a.wiphone.io/), to inhabitants who require it, and much, much later, a fully Open Source, [RISC V](https://riscv.org/) based smartphone running [Android ROM](https://source.android.com/)s or [GNU/Linux distros](https://itsfoss.com/open-source-alternatives-android/) with touch friendly UIs.
* Establishing a real, public transport system using car-sharing algorithms (Real Sharing and not Uber/Ola/Lyft/.../'s share washed micro-lending economy) to share the leftover seating & storage spaces on our existing Cars, converting our petrol & diesel drinkers to sustainable, local sources, such as electric, via renewables like solar, wind, hydro, etc., collecting, scavenging & hacking the abandonned vehicles, lying on randomly on roads, especially around Police Stations to aid these ventures, producing, distributing & evolving the [WikiSpeed](http://wikispeed.org/), [OSCAR](http://www.theoscarproject.org/), [OpenMotors](https://www.openmotors.co/)' [Tabby](https://www.openmotors.co/tabbyevo/), [FOSMC](https://www.fictiv.com/blog/fosmc), & other platforms, and connecting them as a Transport Commons for everyone to enjoy.
* Running networks of [submersiles](https://www.openrov.com/), [solar powered](https://solarimpulse.com/), [lightweight](http://ligeti-stratos.com/index.html) [aircraft](http://makerplane.org/) & [low altitude satellite systems](https://libre.space/), to physically reach greater distances without having to go through state regulations and corporate pay walling.
* Establishing distributed power-grids, using solar, wind and other available, sustainable technology, to escape our dependence on the Power Corps.
* Movement to Open Source platforms, as opposed to proprietary, private ones to remove our dependence on Corps. For instance, moving from MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, etc. to GNU/Linux distros, FreeBSD forks, etc.
* Nurturing Open Source Communities, to voluntarily labour to help develop the global Open Source pool and other Commons
* Creating a [network](https://farm.bot/) of Vertical Farms, Aeroponic Gardens, Aquaponic Greenhouses, and so on to [produce](http://farmhack.org/tools) Food Commons for us all, networking into a post-market, moneyless ecosystem using the [Open Food Network](https://openfoodnetwork.org/).

Science/Technology,"India is not a country, it is a union of countries",20,6w8oqs,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/6w8oqs/india_is_not_a_country_it_is_a_union_of_countries/,44,"Ever since I can remember, I have wanted to improve the state of affairs of this country fundamentally. As a millennial, when I was young I was inspired by our independence and the patriotism that followed it. But as I grew and explored what the nation of India intrinsically meant and what it‚Äôs true genealogy was, it started spiraling down to be an empty concept. 

Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they‚Äôre claiming as their nation. This formation of a country, in cases other than autocracy, could be incited through a common ancestry, language, religion or ideology. The Indian independence incited us to form this nation, the constitution sealed it. But what is it really that binds us? Religion? No, we‚Äôre supposedly a secular nation. Language? Of course not. Ancestry? Not so much. Ancestrally, Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans than they‚Äôre to Biharis. Ideology? Nope. 

So why are we still a single country? Because, TAX. The centre can tax the whole country which is a HUMUNGOUS sum of money considering our ever-growing population. The governments have generation after generation fooled us using ‚Äònationalism‚Äô while they eat our hard-earned tax. It is our money, it is our time and energy. I have agreed through the constitution to pay taxes along with my fellow people for a service, a service called the government. The only responsibility of this service is to improve the life of it‚Äôs people. But what it has become is a handful of pigs gobbling up the tax collected from a BILLION people. With this enormous sum of money comes enormous  power, the power to buy anything and everything. The power to buy the media. The power to cause so much toxic language pollution (fake news) that none of us realize what the real problems are. The power to stagnate education and hence reason. The pigs took away education from us, the worst thing that could be done as a government, it‚Äôs worse than physically crippling one. 

When we are given statistics like India's GDP is the sixth highest, it hides a lot of important information. Per capita is what matters. We're not supposed compare an economy of 1.3 Billion to 82 million of Germany or 127 million of Japan. There is absolutely nothing to be proud of. It's fallacious, it's a pseudo-statistic. The population of Bihar and UP combined is a 300 million. Yet we're constantly fooled by similar statistics that adds to our epidemic complacency that we're a growing nation. Science, technology, economy, healthcare, sports everywhere the statistics can fool us if we see us as just one country. 

Democracy is naive. A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy. When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day‚Äôs wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power. 

I‚Äôm no anti-national. National and anti-national don‚Äôt even mean anything if one digs deeper. They‚Äôre simply terms used by people for selfish reasons to stamp a person and reduce the details of what he/she says to merely ‚Äònational‚Äô or ‚Äòanti-national‚Äô. We should simply stop using these terms and use a more productive terminology to label and discuss ideas. Everything is in the details, this is not about clickbait and headlines, these are supremely complex and deep problems that cannot be discussed and solved if we use crass terminology. The pigs are chauvinists and language polluters, they don‚Äôt care, they don‚Äôt even know, they will say anything to get media‚Äôs attention and media‚Äôs attention is more votes. What we need is a radical ideological revolution to give meaning to this beautiful ‚Äònation‚Äô. We should evolve to form a confederacy of countries based on a modern yet moral ideology. ",redditvsfacebook," A country is not a country .....its a union of states.

A state is not a state....its a union of divisions.

A division is not a division.....its a union of districts.

A district is not a district.....its a union of mohallas.

A mohalla is not a mohalla.....its a union of families.

A family is not a family....its a union of individuals.

Whats the point ?? Pigs everywhere !!!! You sound pretty salty here. Let's clarify some things:

1. There are nations that form for different reasons. India formed because of the of a) The British (at least in terms of their empire) and b) The Indian Freedom Fighters (who tried to keep the country consolidated after independence. Kudos particularly to Vallabhai Patel and Jawaharlal Nehru. http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/S8YxVMKFfwaIeLHUWCYINI/Vallabhbhai-Patel-and-the-making-of-India.html)

1. Second, their rationale behind them was not to ""Collect Taxes"". Contrary to what you're saying, the fathers of our nation believed that we were better and stronger together. Patel, Nehru, Gandhi, Ambedkar, Naidu, et. al. believed keeping the Indian state intact was the natural thing to do. They had a relatively cosmopolitan education/upbringing and believed people of all states needed to band together. Their regional affiliations didn't necessarily bleed onto their mission.

1. While I agree there's a lot of graft and corruption in the Indian Bureaucracy and Political System, India has done well since independence, particularly in the last two decades. How can I say this? Well, GDP per capita has risen from $1100 in 1990 to $6570 in 2016. Here's the source: http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.PP.CD?locations=IN

1. You mention India has a Billion people (1.324 Billion) and then complain about education for everyone. You do realize that's a LOT of people right. It'll take decades for primary education to reach them all. Some states are doing it better than others (Kerala for example). It just requires political will.

1. You talk about our GDP numbers like they're a smokescreen. It's not. India is one of the largest economies in the world and while our GDP per capita isn't equal to that of western nations and other Asian countries, it also means we have tremendous potential for growth. Something other countries are struggling with. I hate people comparing us with the US and other European countries. We're literally one of the youngest countries in the world! How well do you think the US was doing in 1860?

1. Democracy is supposed to mean every person has a single vote. It has its flaws, but it is the fairest form of governance. At the end of the day, an imperfect system is better than an oppressive one. And give Indians the credit they deserve. Modi was voted in to bring economic reform. People voted for him because they wanted better lives for their kids. Vote bank politics is dying, slowly but surely. 


Finally, I'd like to say, I know your intentions are very noble here. But it's easy to sit back and complain and bitch about the country. It's harder to roll up your sleeves and work for the nation. I'm not saying you don't do that, but r/india is a great resource to discuss this. There are many educated and diverse opinions here. Eventually, the unkills will leave the country behind for us. Let's not become like them and die saying Sare Jahan se accha Hindustan hamara and then having their kids move abroad.  Add a TLDR please..and I don't know what you are trying to get at.. and how you arrived on answer of union of states, from tax. 

Eating tax of a billion people.?? Which tax are we talking about? The number income tax payers is < 3 %

 >Nations are formed when a group of people identify themselves as belonging to a common genealogy and demand that they are the righteous owners of the land that they‚Äôre claiming as their nation.

This nationalism is a very modern concept. We been cosmopolitan from early ages itself. And cherished the subcontinent or peninsula more like a single entity of similar culture. 

For example Sankaracharya from extreme south established four temples at the four corners of modern India at an ancient time where nationalism wasn't upfront. Ujjain has remained the astronomical center for many of Indian calenders, irrespective of kingdoms. 

There is a reason for our extreme population, the land has been sought out by people from all over for fertile pastures and wealth, and those who came here settled. And diversity was inherent of land that shaped its culture, unlike other countries where ethnic groups clustered together. While in America every differences get melted into single stream, here people welcomed the diversity, and it still says that way. 

Also if European population hasn't moved out to their colonies, they would have been faced with this population problem as ours, am sure. > Tamils are more related to Sri Lankans

Nope. Sinhala people are Indo Aryan. They are more closer to Bengalis and Biharis than Tamilians. Your argument is trying to make India out to be a special snowflake.

Just look up the history of the **US of A** or **Germany.**

India's circumstances are not unique or new. These guys will give you the same old bullshit man that's the problem. Fuckers will still tell you about mother india being rich and wealthy centuries ago. We gave the world zero blah blah fucking blah. India is tragic as fuck, the talent and the potential is out of this world but the majority of the people are absolute fucking filth when it comes to mentality. Materialistic, show off, jealous, blinded by religion. Anything for the rupee, will literally sell their own mothers for money. They consider the ability to have maids and slaves as a fucking wow factor of living in India in 2017........all the butthurts are going to down vote this to death. 2 or 3 percent of people won't be like this. Biggest tragedy was the goras leaving. But OP is right though.....no unity at all. Which is one reason I love watching the Indian cricket team at least I feel like there is some unity, that and probably the defense forces. General public bheinchod tamasha dekhne ke liye paida hui hai. Bollywood, Ekta Kapoor, Politics, Babas.....so much chutiyappa. What you basically want is a federal structure, and you'd be surprised to know that the concepts of federalism is already there in the constitution. There are topics which are the state govt's prerogative and the central govt. can't interfere, and there are topics where the opposite is true. It's the reason why we have state governments at all in addition to having central governments. Federalism is something our founding fathers believed in, all it needs is to be strengthened and properly observed. I don't think your idea of completely splitting the country apart into smaller nations is viable. If nothing else, surely you believe that having a single unified military and financial structure is more beneficial than having dozens of them?

>A susceptible and complacent peon has the same weightage of vote as a well-learned professor who really cares for the country and contributes 10000% more towards its economy.

The point of democracy is that every citizen has an equal vote share by the virtue of being a citizen, not by the virtue of how productive they are or how educated. If you spend a few minutes pondering on what you wrote, you'd realize how unfair your proposed system would be and how quickly it'll lead to tyranny, by a group if not by an individual.

>When the quality of the population is extremely low because of the enormous population and lack of education, votes can be bought easily because they do not have to ability to reason for themselves, a day‚Äôs wage and meal is itself an accomplishment for most. Millions of people are swayed for vote by throwing one-time food and liquor, fake promises and fake news all because the pigs never let them get educated and forcibly put them in such a situation for their own gains to power.

Which is still better than not caring about votes at all and just shoving a gun at people's faces and telling them to do this and that. Again, while nobody says democracy is perfect, you'd realize it's still better than all the alternatives. Enlightened dictatorships only happen in fictions. This feels like a bad idea. Our ""confideracy"" of states will get chewed out by China. Besides.. being part of the same country is beneficial. Look at the water disputed between Karnataka and TN. Things would be a lot worse.

Science/Technology,Need help with depression and anger.,7,7yz12m,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/7yz12m/need_help_with_depression_and_anger/,3,"Recently got my heart broken, realised it was unrequited love. Been feeling like shit since then. Now I think I'll have to live with this all my life. My life is nearly fucked up beyond all repairs. I thought this might be the last phase of my depression but it's just another phase, all I want to know is when will this shit end. My demons are killing me from inside. I'm hurt more than I show.

The anxiety and insecurity was killing me from a long way back but now when came to know about it being unrequited just turned them into deep/severe depression. I just can't concentrate on any thing. My memory is all gone I think, I'm numb and soulless from inside. 

I was handling it pretty well then day before yesterday one of my toxic friend started snooping her and then messaged me about it which fucked me up pretty badly. I just don't know why, what am I doing. 

Nowadays for me a ""good day"" is the one in which I'm less hurt and less dying from inside. I don't think there's anything called ""happiness"" it's just a myth in my opinion. 

I even read 'The subtle art of not giving a fuck' it helped me for sometime but now I'm again back to square one. 

Why is that all of a sudden all I'm thinking about are relationships, all my friends discuss onlu about girls and then they start crying about their past failed relationships man don't you guys have anything else to discuss. We're just 18 why can't we discuss something about science, technology,career, business, politics etc why the fuck all of a sudden after entering the college all I hear and discuss about relationships, ""ohh what if I die single"" ""ohh why I'm a nice guy"" ""ohhhh Fuck I never had been in a relationship till now and I don't wanna graduate single"" are the thoughts which wander in my mind. 

Pre-college I was never like this, I was a positive guy, minding my own fucking business, wanted to do something in life, had so many dreams of my career but now 7-8 months later all those realistic goals are blurred all I'm surrounded by is ""relationship goals"" why is my generation so much into this ""my soul mate"" shit can't they focus on their career and become something big so that their parents can be proud of them? No all they want is a ""shoulder to cry on"" ""another person to share all they had in their good for nothing day"" more interested in ""opposite gender"" if you don't have any ""opposite gender bestie"" then you're a piece is shit, if you don't have a ""significant other"" you're good for nothing, if you're a shy guy who just likes to listen more than to speak then you're not worth ""dating"". 

And what's wrong with this Indian system of dating. You first start ""liking"" the other person then you ""propose"" and then you start dating. Dafaq!!?  Why can you first start ""seeing"" each other then start dating and then if things turn out pretty good then you're automatically in a relationship no need to propose for being ""girlfriend/boyfriend"".

I'm just losing it all, I don't want to be in a relationship I don't even wanna hear anything related with it, all I want is to concentrate on my career cause that's what will start with me in the long run. But apparently I can't focus on it. Anybody of you got anything which might help me? 

I've decided to change few things surrounding me and with myself.

1) I'll not speak or discuss anything about relationships or my heart break with friends in college anymore cause all they give is very toxic advice like beating up the other guy and so on.

2) I'll try my best to focus back on my career.

3) I'll try ""pleasure-mastery"" therapy.

2. Get a hobby. Something interesting like writing, trading in market, photography, which ever takes your interest try it.   

3. Stop caring about society and don't give a shit about it. Society will be first one to trash you when you do something wrong. Stop caring about what people feel abot you. Their thinking is dynamic and will change according to circumstances.   

4. Discover a new outlook towards life.

In the immediate aftermath, I felt like being the worst human being. I mean, if being nice still gets you hurt, what's the point of being nice? But for some unknown reason, I didn't go down the dark path of self-sabotage.


The first month was hard. I felt numb. I tried the Body scan technique of mindfulness (Lecture 8, TTC Mindfulness...courtesy tpb :-)

It was nice.


But my recovery started with Brexit and a feeling of schadenfreude. In hindsight, I feel it was a negative straw to latch on to. But it rejuvenated my curiosity to learn about the world i am in.


After a while, I found my appreciation for simple joys of life like pani puri, walking, ice-cream. I am not saying your grief is not real. Heck, the condition I was in, any advice would have made my self-loathing worse.

Science/Technology,"[NP]Engineering Education In India: Hot Intake, Cold Results",46,4gbzmf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/4gbzmf/npengineering_education_in_india_hot_intake_cold/,18,"Under the new NDA government, there has been a rush to establish a glut of premier technical institutions. A proposal for six new IITs has been ratified, in addition to the nine new ones already established in 2008. The total number of candidates in the JEE (Mains) was 12.5 lakhs this year. The All India Council for Technical Education recognizes a whopping 6,378 institutions for undergraduate engineering study, with a humongous intake of 31.78 lakh. The All-India Survey on Higher Education (AISHE) report for the year 2013-14 pegs the proportion of undergraduate enrolment in engineering, technology and computer fields combined at 20.08%, second only to the combined field of Arts, Humanities and the Social Sciences.

However, does quantity mean quality? Does offering long-reaching career choices to students not old enough to vote or drink, and parents out of sync with the current market and research scenario fare well in the context of Indian higher education?

**Indicators of Concern**

*Employability*

The National Employability Report published by Aspiring Minds in 2015 presents worrying numbers that paint a sorry picture. It found a meagre 17.91% engineers employable in the software services sector, and an abysmal 3.67% in the software products sector. In non-IT roles, the statistics were as alarming, with only 6.5% and 5.55% engineers employable in design roles in electrical and mechanical engineering respectively. 

The report comments that most candidates lack basic programming and algorithmic knowledge, and in non-IT core roles, there is lack of a clear grasp of fundamentals, which is often the only thing required by recruiters. In fact, it says that 60% of engineers lag behind by not possessing specific domain knowledge. 

The go-to option for a burgeoning class of aspirers, engineering represents the ‚Äúeasy path‚Äù, and a focus on end results eclipses learning processes. Moreover, choices of specialization are made based on entrance examination ranks, before any taste of specialised curricula or actual field work in a particular subject. Such ill-informed decision-making is bound to generate an outpouring of reluctant engineers who are confused and ill-equipped in their respective areas. 

*Output*

The other important outcome of technical education is research and development. Contributing to advancing technology in terms of academic research and patents is an important development indicator, as R&D output has direct effects on economic prosperity and standard of living. 

The SCImago Journal & Country Rank rates publications and countries in terms of research output in different fields. Ranking countries by citations-per-document published, which indicates the average number of times a paper has been cited by other works, we find India ranked a middling 40th among 87 nations with at least 1000 engineering publications from 1996 to 2014. 

According to data collected by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) on selected indicators of innovation among labs and higher educational institutions in 2014, we find India comes 31st out of 48 ranked entities in terms of patents filed per GDP as a percentage (including a combined number for the EU, which comes above India). 

We see how India languishes in the middle in terms of both patents and it the citation counts of academic publications. What forces are afoot that drag India‚Äôs comparative performance into mediocrity despite the colossal undergraduate intake? Let‚Äôs crunch some numbers to get to the bottom of it.

**A Chain of Causes**

*Postgraduate Education*

Research output also measures the health of postgraduate and doctoral education in the countries, signalling the willingness of undergraduates to continue in the field of their choosing. A report published in 2013 by the South Asia Development Sector of the World Bank says that 94.56% of engineering students in India are undergraduates, with only 5.4% in Master‚Äôs programs, the lowest but for Brazil. 

At the same time, a 2014 report published by the Student Exchange and Visitor Program (SEVP) in the United States says that a huge majority (81%) of India-based graduate students are in STEM fields. 

This data points to a prevalent scenario in which limited information and social pressure compels undergraduates to pick engineering, but the higher education machinery fails to retain numbers at postgraduate levels, at least in India.  Students who can afford it fly abroad, especially to the US for search of better options in education and employment. 
The AISHE 2013-14 report also says that only 9% of its respondents who had enrolled in postgraduate courses went on to pursue a PhD in the field, which links us to the next issue. 

*Throttled Funds*

The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation. Junior research fellows take home Rs. 25,000 per month, while senior PhD candidates get Rs. 28,000. Moreover, insufficient funds are allocated to science and engineering research, making the production of high quality matter more challenging. 
International Science and Engineering Indicators published by the National Science Foundation of the USA include the proportion of GDP expended on R&D, based on which India ranks 40th among 60 nations studied, with a lowly 0.81%
. 

*Teacher Numbers*

Above, we saw how small a percentage of students transition to postgraduate and doctoral studies in their fields, and by extension, the number of qualified teachers at college level falls down, denting the prospects of a proper education for subsequent generations of students, creating a vicious loop of negative feedback. 

Two other statistics and their comparisons in the above mentioned World Bank report signal a severe shortage of teaching resources in the engineering education arena.

Using general higher education statistics from MHRD reports in 2011, the report estimates the average faculty per institution at 19, and the student-to-faculty ratio at 24. The latter ratio depicts the even spreading of teaching resources, and a high value means lesser attention to every individual student‚Äôs learning objectives. To put the number into perspective, the AICTE recommends a ratio of 12 at undergraduate level, and 15 at graduate level. 

With better-paying avenues in regular jobs, most fresh graduates stay away from the lengthy and arduous path of academia and teaching.

**Conclusions**

The lack of postgraduates, doctoral researchers, and the best teachers prevents the blossoming of a rewarding academic atmosphere and thus makes departments accumulate reluctant and untrained teachers, by making them unattractive to the best talents.  This stunts exposure to good teaching and research for undergraduates, which in turn contributes to disillusionment, insufficient interest and technical knowledge, low employability rates, and a departure from technical fields of work and study post their first degree, feeding the crippling dearth of skills and results at higher levels.

Anecdotal but i can attest to just a handful of my electrical engineering class of 61 actually understanding what we were being taught. The rest were just in in to clear the exams.

IMHO, another indicator of the quality of a country's education is the contents of the text books it's home-grown authors produce. The indians ones are by and large terrible. The focus on rote learning and mindless memorisation is soul-crushing. And those ""guides"" are so bad it's not even funny. 

This problem is compounded when the people teaching you use the same guides to teach and themselves don't understand what they're teaching. I got into several arguments about my scores being docked because i'd solved something by actually thinking instead of using what was in the ""book"".  Very well written!

IMO, the good faculties are on the look out for good PhD students and good PhD students are on the look out for good faculties. Currently, it is hard to find either in India. As OP mentions,

> The dearth of doctoral students in engineering fields owes itself in no small part to inadequate compensation.

From the Computer Science and Engineering perspective, there are two sides to this. In general, a student who has the capacity to do a good PhD is likely capable of working in a good corporate company. Say a good student gets a job which pays ~7lpa. If he/she stays in the industry for 5 years, this would definitely (atleast) double. One can lead a good decently luxurious life with this sort of income. Now come to the Indian PhD student. He/she earns 3.36lpa + travel + book grants, for 5 years (it is not common to have raises for a PhD student). What follows is obvious.

Now one could argue that a student who is actually interested in research should not bother about money. But hell, the student also has a life outside research and needs to have some savings for the future! It is not easy to find jobs in India which require PhDs and do justice to them.

Now without good students, it becomes difficult for good faculties to 'want' to stay in the country. This can, again, be fixed by increasing compensation and freedom for the faculties. 

We need to take lessons from Israel. A country as big as Mizoram, has 9 universities, around 6 of them being in the top 100 universities of the world. Even though I do not trust world rankings too much, it is sufficient enough to believe that their 6th will be as good as our best. How did they manage this? I am not sure, but I do not think nationalism has played too much of a role. It is probably due setting up the best infrastructure, inviting the best researchers, giving them sufficient compensation and a lot of academic freedom.

**tl; dr** Invite the best researchers, give them sufficient compensation, academic freedom. Students and quality of research will follow.

We could also get married and I could apply for an X-visa, and whilst marriage is on the cards, and eventually I will apply for an OCI card, the X-visa doesn't let you work, and so short-term isn't much use above letting me stay there whilst I look for work.

I understand when a new govt comes to power it appoints its own people to the govt offices. When UPA came to power in 2004, it replaced most of the state governers with its own sympathizers. Now that BJP has come to power, it did the same thing except Mr. Najib Jung. **Fair enough and pretty much consistent**

But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance? How does it serve any purpose? Isn't it against the very philosophy of Make In India? If you want India to develop, you need to have qualified guardians at the institutions of national importance.

I understand that India academia is highly influences by leftist ideology which I personally despise. I'm libertarian & pro-capitalism when it comes to economic ideology. 

BJP is Far Right Wing which has pro-capitalism as economic philosophy at its core. But how do recent appointments justify it? If right wing is about market capitalism, should not BJP give more autonomy to these institutions, instead of screwing up their reputation with high-handed appointments.

I understand top brass of BJP/RSS feel that curricula of Indian education system is against Indian culture/traditions. They also feel that history subject is biased. But if they want to change it, shouldn't they do it at the school level. 

Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?

India already doesn't have any Univ in the top 300 ranking of QS world ranking. With recent high-handed appointments, I'm sure their quality will take a nosedive.

This is pretty much my thoughts. Let us please discuss it. I would request people not to take sides. Please be objective in your analysis based on logic. It's not about BJP/Congress/AAP. It's about me and your future.

EDIT: WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated. C'mon yaar, it took me a lot efforts to dig all the relevant info, I would request you not to downvote it. Please leave this thread if you dont wanna participate.
",Responsbile_Indian," Off topic, but I should probably avoid trying for FTII next year? I dont know about FTII. As far as research institutes go, there is a bit of laxity and there is no direction in research. Most scientists just want to publish papers, and I am not  trying to undermine the importance of publishing papers or basic research, but there has to be a goal of developing technology/product which aligns with national policy and interests. 

ISRO is a good example when a research institute is in alignment with national interests and policy. This example is probably a little simplistic because in institutes like IIT/IISc/NCL etc it is harder to define goals. And even harder to achieve these goals.

To develop a technology which is applicable in the real world, it takes a lot of time and effort and in addition almost every new technology takes a multidisciplinary approach to develop. From my experience the Indian research institutes lack severely in the latter.

There are several other problems as well, but be assured appointment of a member of board of director or even director of an institute will not affect the quality (existing) of research in the institute. And the low world rankings are mostly because of lack of infrastructure and lop-sided faculty/student ratio.

 [deleted] > Anyway institutions like IIT/TIFR/IISSc/IIMs are mostly about science, technology & technology. So, why messing with them?  

Because they have failed at their primary goals? Negligible research output, unimpressive pedagogy and a vision that is missing in action. A bit of a shakeup at the top wont hurt. 

FTII on the other hand deserved better than Sri Gajendra. 
 >WHat the hell! Seems, downvoting brigade is already activated

Party before Country . Right-wingers definition of nationalism . kids have come to power after 60 years :) . Don't worry next elections they are gonna loose for sure and every state elections from now on  FTII, and Indian film making in general, is as shitty as it can get.

People say Gajendra Chouhan is not qualified to be FTII chief. I say FTII is so shitty, even a random 40 year old with some life experience can only improve it. The one condition is that he/she should not come from FTII, or Indian mainstream film-making, which is just pure horseshit. 
  how is FTII and institution of national importance?

Second question, why should government be in the business of running FTII. >But one thing I don't get is why is BJP appointing unqualified people in the institutions of national importance?

You have **one** data point for this.  OP, just one correction. BJP is not far right in the generally accepted spectrum. If anything they would be considered left of centre. Economically, not much separates the BJP and tbh most other parties. Between the Congress and BJP? It is just that the BJP has better execution of projects and lesser vote bank politics. Youth congress making a mountain out of a molehill. Just riling up students for no rhyme or reason. Did UPA not make appointments for these posts? Did EVERY government not make appointments? This is just a front.

Science/Technology,An Exposition and Solution to the NGO problem,1,28fy7b,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/28fy7b/an_exposition_and_solution_to_the_ngo_problem/,1,"**Disclaimer**: I am not the author. This excellent essay was written by Rudradev@BRF.  

NGOs are non-profit organizations whose ostensible role is to fill in the gaps of social service: education, community services (such as sanitation and health), conservation of natural resources etc. that a government is either too resource-poor and overburdened to fill (as in India) or is not mandated to fill for reasons of small-government conservative political philosophy (as in many developed Western countries).

There have been many such organizations that would fit today's definition of the NGO, that have in fact done a lot of good in India. Amul was a farmer's cooperative in Gujarat that transformed the dairy industry. Baba Amte's organization helped leprosy patients who suffered unjust marginalization and ostracism in rural Maharashtra. The Chipko movement was spearheaded by tribals to preserve their own forest resources. The IDRF and the RSS have been at the forefront of many disaster relief missions. As long as these movements are indigenous, draw their support from local volunteers, and function in coherence with deep-state interests, they have been able to contribute important and desirable services of all kinds.

The problem, of course, arises when foreign resources are used to support NGOs working in India. I have a couple of stories that illustrate why this is by no means a new problem in India, and to suggest a potential solution to the problem of ""filling the gaps in services"" that have given foreign-funded NGOs a way into our system.

The first case involves a close relative of mine. As a newly-minted engineer in the early 1950s, he came to Bombay to join a Government of India concern. The concern at the time was inducting a new technology with American help, as part of a USAID program. An American had been sent to train the Indian engineers in the use of this new technology as part of the foreign assistance package. This was a very common arrangement in the first decade after independence, when the GOI's mission statement emphasized advancements in science, technology and industry.

This American had spent some of his early years in Dehra Dun, and did a passable job of speaking Hindi. He was a genuine expert in his field, was employed full-time at a major US corporation, and trained the young Indian engineers very well. He would also sit in his office after hours, late into the night, typing messages into a telex machine. The Indian engineers, including my relative, would sometimes wonder what was up... ""jasoosi kar raha hai kya?"" On one occasion one of the Indians brought up the matter with the IAS officer in charge of the concern. His reply: ""Is he teaching you well? Then learn from him. Why are you worried what he is doing or not doing otherwise.""

And indeed, they were learning a lot from this American; as young men with Indian traditional values, they respected him as a guru, and in fact many of them went on to have successful and illustrious careers with the benefit of his knowledge. So they let it go.

It wasn't until 20 years later that my relative discovered, by chance, a newspaper clipping of his old American trainer receiving a medal from US President Gerald Ford. It turned out the American was an OSS man who had served with distinction in Burma during the Second World War, and had been on deputation with the CIA in many countries since then, including India.

The point of this story is that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, ever since India became independent. Foreign assistance came to India at the GOI's request to help fill the gaps in governance (such as advanced training) that the GOI itself was not equipped to plug. Often the assistance package came with strings attached; they were manned by foreign intelligence agents, for example. More surprisingly the GOI KNEW about this, and accepted it... they probably monitored the foreign agents' activities, and tried to ensure that they didn't get their eyes on anything too sensitive, but in the interest of the ""greater good"", GOI policy determined that it was better to have a CIA guy training Indians in a new technology than to not have the training at all. That's just how the priorities shook out.

One can almost understand the appetite for these sort of ""arrangements"" in a new and desperately poor nation willing to pay a high price to improve its future prospects. However, as we know, India's prospects did not improve substantially over the following decades. Corrupt, self-serving regimes led by successive Dynasty potentates showed little interest in building self-sufficiency, in plugging the gaps in governance or indeed, in providing any governance at all. Thus, what was deemed a necessary evil in the 1950s did not fade into obsolescence by the 1960s or 1980s or 2000s... instead, it transformed into an extremely powerful and well-established institution in its own right. The industry of foreign funded NGOs came to dominate every aspect of social, judicial, economic and environmental activism across the length and breadth of India. Over the decades, it usurped mandates extending far beyond its originally stated purpose of supplementing government services. All the while, of course, it never held any commitment to upholding the interests of the Indian deep state.

The NGO monster reached the pinnacle of its strength under Sonia Gandhi's regime over the last decade, finding its ultimate embodiment in the National Advisory Council: a parallel national-level policy-making apparatus, indebted to all manner of foreign interests, that did not supplement the elected Government of India but utterly sidelined it. In the meantime, every constitutionally-mandated institution of the Indian deep state: financial, internal security, armed forces, judicial, was systematically undermined and eroded. This, in fact, is what the IB is warning us of the urgent need to roll back.

So now to my second story that suggests a possible solution to this problem. There are persistent lacunae in social and environmental services that the GOI does not yet fill in India; this we all know. It's also true that the GOI has a vast roster of priority issues to fix at a macro-level, so that however indefatigable Mr. Modi might be, he might very well never get around to taking on these lacunae himself. How do we ensure that they are filled by agents with a sterling sense of commitment to the Indian deep state?

The second story involves a gentleman named Mike who was my neighbour in NYC. I met him when he was 84, and he died five years later.

Mike was a first-generation Italian American immigrant who grew up supporting eight siblings in a small town in upstate New York during the Great Depression. This was a double-whammy: Italians were racially discriminated against by the WASP majority, and the economic circumstances of the time engendered a sort of starvation-level poverty, a near absence of hope in terms of access to education or employment, that the US has not known since the second world war ended.

The solution came from Franklin Delano Roosevelt, a US President whom Mike revered as almost greater than human. Apart from a sweeping series of macro-level fiscal reforms, Roosevelt introduced a volunteer initiative called the Civilian Conservation Corps. As part of the New Deal, the CCC provided unskilled manual labour jobs related to the conservation of natural resources in government-owned lands, creating employment for the deprived while also implementing a general natural resource conservation program in every state and territory.

Over 3 million young Americans participated in the CCC, which provided food, shelter and clothing as well as a small stipend; however, it did something far more important. It provided a population on the brink of despair with a sense of commitment, a motivation to serve the community and the nation, and a will to public responsibility. It restored the dignity of a generation who would otherwise have been reduced to begging on the streets. In the case of Mike, and many lakhs of Italian-Americans, this brought about an invaluable infusion of a nationalist spirit that brought them from the margins of society into the mainstream. Learning skills as he went along, conducting minor maintenance on public utilities, helping keep the streets and parks clean and sanitary, Mike eventually joined the US Navy and fought in the Pacific as a Diesel Mechanic on an LST. The GI bill, also a Roosevelt initiative, gave Mike the opportunity to get an automobile engineering degree afterwards, transforming his life (and that of his family) beyond recognition.

What could have been a wasted life of social marginalization and economic victimhood was transformed into an asset to the nation in every way. As one consequence, more Italian immigrants signed up to fight for the US in the Second World War than the total strength of Mussolini's forces!

A very similar initiative to the CCC was taken up by the NSDAP in Germany around the same time: the creation of the Arbeitsdienst. It is derided as ""fascist"" in the dominant Western narrative of today, but it contributed a great deal to the spirit of millions of young men who grew up in the crushing deprivation of Weimar Germany but found themselves willing to sacrifice everything for the Reich.

Can we begin to imagine a time when the ""marginalized"" sections of our own society aren't deliberately kept ""marginalized"" for the benefit of NGOs who profit from their ongoing despair? Where the service left undone by the GOI isn't left to foreign agents with no regard for our national interest, but indeed transforms a generation of Indians... through the very act of rendering that work... into the foremost proponents of national interest in the future?",nerds_revenge," Remaining essay: 


This can ONLY happen when the volunteer agencies who fill in the gaps left by the GOI
(1) are initiated, mandated and funded by the deep-state itself;
(2) inculcate through their activities a sense of mission, dignity and responsibility that serves aspiration rather than victimhood;
(3) are TRULY not-for-profit, and are not designed to perpetuate their own existence indefinitely.

This last is a crucial distinction; NGOs which define themselves as ""non-profit"" have a strong interest in maintaining the deprivation of those they claim to ""help"", because their OWN survival, and the perpetual continuation of their gravy train, depends on it.",2014-06-18 21:07:31

\> The IISc team observed that at a critical temperature of 160 K (-113.15 degree C) and critical current of little less than 10 milliampere the voltage suddenly shoots up and the gold-silver nanostructures no longer exhibit superconductivity as resistance increases rapidly.

For example, good education is key, and our teachers, researchers, educationists and civil society are a crucial part of the resistance. But **even as they complain about rising levels of mediocrity and inefficiency, perpetrated by ceaseless administrative meddling, the government does not seek to solve the problem as much as use it as an excuse to perpetrate further mediocrity and discrimination.**

&#x200B;

It might be true but you have to prove it before you print and start teaching kids, a lot of research is needed at scholarly level Modi government want every child to sell tea like how lord Modi did. And then they complain about brain drain I want to bring the children of India towards science. This is the only way to kill pseudoscience and superstitions.  I wish I had enough money to start a project that takes scientific education to every part of India.  This would be a journal of BJP stupidity in printed forget, See, people who are dumb, lazy, without an iota of critical thinking, comepletely superstitious, are very easy to subdue and control. You can guess what their endgame is. What's the end game?

Is this just another jumla to win more elections?

Don't they want to actually run the country for about 20-30 years?

Are they all one day going to get up and scoot to Antigua, Nigeria and UK?

Ambani cannot run away like Choksi or Modi did.

Nor can the Sangh.

Can't they see that the first chance that China sees of a broken country, they will try to control the country?

What's the 20 year game plan of Shah?

Winning elections is cool and I respect their awesome skills at manipulating everybody and everything without hacking EVMs, but in the end, where is this headed?

A feudal India is just waiting to be colonised or defeated economically to the point of virtual colonisation like China is doing with African and some Central and West Asian nations. USA is on the decline. China isn't going to stop till it becomes _the_ biggest superpower.

Modi can't see how he is dismantling the country because he is a psycopath who has achieved his life goal and is rudderless. He already has become King Emperor. There's nothing left to do.

But what's with the Sangh and Shah?

The Sangh plans well, like an expert Sith Lord waiting for decades.

I don't see an endgame here that benefits them - unless they really truly believe in a 1800s or 1700s culture as being the best for India. Then we are truly in the grip of a mad cult.

But I doubt that. Ambani, of all people, has serious vision. Will he step in and become PM? If not openly, by proxy?

Doesn't he have a vision for a billion and half potential slaves?

He has to understand economics really well, right?

Disposable incomes and all that.

What's the Sangh's endgame?

With Congress / UPA you could see that the endgame is simple - stay in power, do 20% good, 30% bad and 50% negligence - and just always stay in power. That 20% good was RTI and stable economy and all that.

With this Govt, there is literally no real 20% good.

There's only madness of one kind or another - cow, Mandir, vedic supremacy, ""China is bad"" while everything patriotic is owned by or made in China, Swachch Bharat is a joke, DeMo was a scam, GST is a disaster, Aadhar is a conspiracy.

Kuch to long term socha bhi hai ki nahi?

I can forgive Modi being a fool. He is a megalomaniac. But I cannot digest that all of them are fools and nobody is asking them to look at the bigger picture or the longer term.

They're behaving like day traders when they own the stock exchange. 

Who does that level of stupidity?

They are the house and they are gambling as if they need to win desperately. What gives?

Are they sure that they will not win more than once?

Is this all a 10 year con with their full knowledge that they cannot get a 3rd term?

If this is a 10 year con, which country are they going to flee to?

I just don't get it.

We're fucked right to the core of the country arent we? Barring a few patches of sanity which involve less than 10% of the country, this is what the rest of India is like isnt it?  bhains = tan kaalaa aur man bhi kaalaa Looks like his videsi gai left him for another guy.
His desi gai stayed though What's the criteria for being declared honest? Shouldn't it be said as racist... Poor buffalo's being discrimated ...  As I veterinary student, it is my experience that the opposite is true in almost all the points. Exotic breeds have a friendlier temperament than indigenous ones, while also having higher production and better feed conversion efficiency. Local breeds are much more aggressive and a nightmare to treat.
And Buffalo milk is much better suited for making products like ice cream, butter, etc due to more fat percentage while buffaloes themselves are more disease resistant in general, and cleaner as they have almost no hair and love bathing in water.
Also, there is no 'surya ketu' nerve. Well none that I've ever read about in any anatomy textbook. M.Tech. Gau Rakshak Last 3 points for buffaloes are sketches of Bollywood villains. Lol at the milk point being mentioned after a statistic on the intestine. UNSECO has declared Indian cow (Gaumata) as the best in the world.

author is confused, maybe?

Abdul Kalam is known as a scientist coz he was one by his profession and designation, in both drdo and isro. One needn't be an academician and guide PhDs like Rao for being worthy of the title. It's the equivalent of saying that professional scientists of NASA or NCAR aren't real scientists as they are not Professors. Unlike the latter whose career depends upon impact factors and finding, career scientists have more security and a more focused domain. Creating a new satellite or any stuff doesn't mean that they are copy pasting or just scaling a design like lego builders; it involves applied science, hundreds or thousands developing new materials, better fuel options, better heat dissipation, structural design, aerodynamics, control systems and all sorta works. And unlike academicians of basic research they don't have the compulsion to publish for brownie points. Sometimes you are not exactly allowed to publish, even.

To the arguement of India lagging behind science, by research output we are at top 5; and research funding we at top 6.

But, this article feels more like Sheldon Cooper making Physicist master race arguement, that surprisingly ends in a compulsive suggestion on the very applied science it has been bashing . India ? Sure a country with more than 1 billion human beings don't know the difference between tech and science because some idiotic article said so.   **India still doesn‚Äôt know the difference between tech & science** and that's why A P J Abdul Kalam is considered by all and sundry to be a scientist.

NEW DELHI: A central panel, set up in April to study the role of cow urine and dung in curing diseases and scientific validation of uniqueness of indigenous cows, is likely to have its first meeting next month when it will assign various projects to ministries and institutions.The panel, headed by science and technology minister Harsh Vardhan , will evaluate the role of 'Panchagavya' ‚Äî a concoction of cow urine mixed with cow dung, milk, curd and ghee ‚Äî in four broad areas like medicine, products for agriculture applications, food and nutrition and utility products.Besides eminent scientists like former CSIR director general R A Mashelkar, the panel has members from RSS and VHP-linked organisations. The tenure of this panel will be for three years. ""Though the panel ‚Äî National Steering Committee NSC ) ‚Äî was constituted long ago, it could not meet so far due to one or the other important engagements of its members,"" said V K Vijay of the Centre for Rural Development and Technology (CRDT), IITDelhi. He is one of the members of the 19-member panel.Amid indication of its first meeting some time next month, Vijay told TOIon Sunday that the panel will function as an apex body for guiding a national programme on 'Scientific Validation and Research on Panchgavya'.TOI had in February reported the government's plan to form such a committee. The panel includes chancellor of Nalanda University in Bihar Vijay P Bhatkar, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao and secretaries of the departments of science & technology, biotechnology and renewable energy. Other members include Sunil Mansinghka of VHPlinked Go Vigyan Anusandhan Kendra which has long been involved in research on cow urine and cow dung.

So what if I wanted research, done by Govt scientists, to be made open to all Indians? Honestly a lot of CSIR labs are absolutely bullshit. They have a lot of fat to trim. 

We had a lab called ""Central Building Research Institute"" at IIT Roorkee, and I they didn't do jack shit. When 38 billion out of 40 billion rupees is spent on salaries and pensions and only 2 billion on research, you know this organization has become a bloated inefficient behemoth. 

 My dad worked there for plenty of years. Says the Institute is corrupt as fuck with very little original research actually comes out. Quite a lot of scientists indulge in petty corruption and a ,ajor requirement is to be a brown noser and not a good scientist if you want to advance your career. If the government demanded a result oriented approach these guys probably failed to deliver and will continue to fail to deliver (although admittedly doing research like that is also not quite possible.) >Recently, CSIR‚Äôs Director-General Girish Sahni claimed that most of CSIR‚Äôs patents were ‚Äúbio-data patents‚Äù, filed solely to enhance the value of a scientist‚Äôs resume and that the extensive expenditure of public funds spent in filing and maintaining patents was unviable. CSIR claims to have licensed a percentage of its patents, but has so far failed to show any revenue earned from the licences.

CSIR had it coming. I don't know why they cannot earn money from their researches if they are doing so much substantial research. ISRO does it and look where it is now; developed its own cryogenic technology . You don't see them begging for funds because they have successfully managed their organisation. And the government doesn't interfere. 

I will be glad if government stop pouring taxpayers money into those other money sucking black holes like Air India, BSNL etc. 

 Why would Modiji give a shit about scientific research and development when he has a full fledged ayush ministry?  Jackass and his govt spends thousands of crores on mindless statues and TV, print, youtube ads, but somehow ran out of money for CSIR? Fucking imbeciles.

i highly recommend that you start with reading up about the visa (Specifically H1B and green card) system for employed foreigners in the USA.

Please do this before you start looking at universities. Andha paisa hai? >1) Which is the earliest session he can target? (R3/R4 deadlines seem to have gone by)

Earliest season deadlines are in August/September. Some schools have ""Early Action"" which may be June/July.


>2) Where do get the list of universities which to target. (Media and Advertising is his preference)


https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-business-schools/marketing-rankings

Do not go below top 20.

>3) What should be the ballpark/vague idea of score without which not to proceed?

Hard to tell as this depends on entire profile. But, At least 700+ for Indian men.

>4) Can appearing multiple times for GMAT have repurcussions? (except the ones incurred by pocket)

No. Most schools take highest score.

>5) What is lumpsum figure for fee (can he can expect to be offered scholarship based on GMAT score)

Tuition around $120k total for two years. Living expenses depends on the city. But budget around $80k-$100k for living expenses for two years. Likelihood of scholarship in top 20 schools is very low based on your profile. If you go below top 20 schools, you may get a scholarship based on GMAT, but you may not get a job.

>6) He is a merchandiser and has been in this industry for 3 years. He has worked for one start up also(pretty crucial role), can leaving his current job for 2-3 months for preparation have negative impact? (in terms of Recommendation letter, Work experience etc.)

Depends on the rapport with the person who will give recommendation letter. Small gaps won't likely have huge impact on application. But three years of overall experience is very low for US b-schools where the median is 5 years and for Indian applicants, it's likely around 7-8 years.


>7) How to not suck at SOP and Essay Writing? (We have no idea except what google told us on how to proceed with this)

Use someone who has done this to review your essays and give you input.

Also, fuck your hindi-speaker employment schemes.

 How about NO.  
We need English and it needs to be promoted further.  ^This ^article ^is ^adblocker ^unfriendly, ^following ^is ^the ^text ^of ^the ^article. 

 ______ 
**India must shed intellectual colonialism to excel in science and technology** 

 ______ 
There is a major power imbalance in the world, which comes from the language
that dominates the world of discovery, innovation, and science and technology.
Today, that language is English. The intellectual domination of the West comes
from the building of communities whose power comes from their deep connection
with their native language. The language which they use to think, dream and
shape the world is their own. This results in ideas that can change the world.
If you do not use or have a mastery over your native language in science and
technology, then, mere facility makes you a great follower and never a leader.

While overthrowing political and economic colonialism, we have failed to
overthrow intellectual colonialism. In making English the sole language of
intellectual discourse in science and technology in India, we have lost on
many fronts. First, exceptions aide, as a community even our best institutions
can never lead globally if English is the only language of high-level
intellectual discourse. Our best minds will merely be eloquent paraphrasers of
the ideas of others. Second, we close opportunities in intellectual leadership
to huge sections of our population. In other words, as intellectuals we cannot
be the best in the world. In addition to this, we lock the doors to even the
second- level positions we occupy as elites. One of the many consequences of
this is a poor connection of professional leadership with our society. Thus,
we fail in being great intellectuals, we exclude and do not share a sense of
purpose for society. In turn, our society responds to this elitism by
undervaluing learning and the intellectual enterprise.

There have been many examples of countries which have successfully addressed
the twin-challenges of developing communities of intellectual leaders in
science and technology and are yet deeply rooted in using their native
language for churning ideas. In Germany, science students would have had their
principal language as German and yet be fluent in English. Many of the best
German labs are international and the language of discourse may well be in
English, yet, the advantage that comes from the ability that German scientists
have to think in their native language, in the most advanced scientific
subjects, is not small. Conversely, no country, including India, that has
chosen English as its primary language of scientific discourse, ignoring its
local languages, has become an intellectual powerhouse.

Whenever there is a discussion on this subject, two arguments are made against
university education in one‚Äôs native language. The first is that English is
necessary in today‚Äôs world, which is valid. The answer is not to diminish
English, but to enhance the use of one‚Äôs native language at every level. The
second argument is that the task is impossible to implement. This argument is
both a cop-out and false. It is a cop-out because not taking this up forever
makes us an intellectual vassal-state, while maintaining an elite that is both
dysfunctional and disinterested. The argument is false because the task is
entirely feasible with focus and investment.

What, then, is to be done? Currently, the bulk of our college education in
science and technology is notionally in English whereas the bulk of our high-
school education is in the local language. Science courses in college are thus
accessible largely to the urban population and even when this happens,
education is effectively, neither of quality in English nor communicated as
translations of quality in the classroom. Starting with the Kendriya
Vidyalayas and the Nayodya Vidyalayas as test-arenas, we can ensure the
training of teachers so that students in high-school are simultaneously taught
in both their native language and in English. This already happens informally,
but its needs formalisation. The student should be free to take exams in
either language or indeed use a free-flowing mix. This approach should be
steadily ramped up and used in all our best educational institutions in
college and then scaled to be used more widely. Public and private colleges,
in STEM subjects, for example, can lead and make bi-lingual professional
education, attractive and economically viable. Technology, can of course
assist implementation, but the primary driver is a will to change.

Our international partners envy the facility many Indians have with English.
Without losing this, we must also have the ability to think deeply about
complex and difficult subjects at the level of the best in the world. This can
come only when communities in Rajasthan, Kerala or Odisha can wield, in their
minds, their respective languages in the frontier areas of science the way in
which the French, the Dutch or the Germans do. We should not conflate the use
of English as the vehicle for communication and commerce with the use of
language as the basis for the power of ideas.

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries.
(Image: PIB)

India will soon start producing first indigenous Lithium Ion batteries. A
memorandum of understanding for transfer of technology for India‚Äôs first
Lithium Ion (Li-ion) Battery project was signed today between CSIR‚Äôs Central
Electro Chemical Research Institute (CECRI), Karaikudi, Tamil Nadu and RAASI
Solar Power Pvt Ltd.

According to the Ministry of Science and Technology, the indigenous technology
of Lithium-ion cells has been developed by a group of CSIR-CECRI headed by Dr
Gopu Kumar in partnership with CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (CSIR-NPL)
New Delhi, CSIR- Central Glass and Ceramic Research Institute (CSIR-CGCRI)
Kolkata and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology (CSIR-IICT) Hyderabad.

‚ÄúCSIR-CECRI has set up a demo facility in Chennai to manufacture prototype
Lithium-Ion cells. It has secured global IPRs with potential to enable cost
reduction, coupled with appropriate supply chain and manufacturing technology
for mass production,‚Äù a Science and Technology Ministry release said today.

**ALSO READ| TATA launches India-made portable MRI scanner**

At present India depends on countries like China, Japan and South Korea for
import of Lithium Ion batteries. India imported Li-Ion batteries worth $150
million in 2017 and is one of its largest importers in the world.

Speaking after the signing of MoUs, Union Science and technology minister
Harsh Vardhan said: ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs development is a validation of the capabilities
of CSIR and its laboratories to meet technology in critical areas to support
our industry, besides other sectors.‚Äù

**ALSO READ| Chinese smartphone maker to locally source this crucial component**

The indigenous production of Li-Ion batteries is expected to boost Prime
Minister Modi flagship programmes like generating 175 Giga Watts of clean
energy by 2022 and National Electric Mobility Mission.

‚ÄúIt will give tremendous boost to two flagship programmes of Prime Minister
Narendra Modi ‚Äì increasing the share of Clean Energy in the energy basket by
generating 175 Giga Watts by 2022, of which 100 Giga Watts will be Solar and
the second, National Electric Mobility Mission, to switch completely to
electric vehicles by 2030,‚Äù said Harsh Vardhan.

The project, the minister said, is also in tune with PM Modi‚Äôs vision of ‚ÄúMake
in India‚Äù to turn the country into ‚Äù a manufacturing hub and to cut down
outflow of foreign exchange.‚Äù

**ALSO READ| Dhanush, India‚Äôs first indigenous long-range artillery gun**

As per the MoU, Raasi Group will set up Li-Ion manufacturing facility in Tamil
Nadu‚Äôs Krishnagiri district, which is close to Bengaluru. The company aims to
bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs 15,000 per KW to replace
the Lead Acid batter. The company also plans to manufacture Li-Ion battery for
solar rooftop with life span of 25 years.

‚ÄúWe want to bring down the cost of cell manufacturing below Rs. 15,000/- per
KW to replace Lead Acid Battery‚Ä¶‚ÄúWe also have plans to make Lithium Ion
battery for solar roof top with life span of 25 years to make it affordable
enough to drive the Photo Voltaic segment,‚Äù Raasi Group Chairman-cum-Managing
Director C Narsimhan said.

Why Lithium-Ion batteries:

Li-Ion batteries have applications in Energy Storage System ‚Äì from hearing aid
to container sized batteries to power a cluster of villages, Electric Vehicles
(2-wheeler, 3-wheeler, 4-wheeler and Bus), portable electronic sector, Grid
Storage, Telecom and Telecommunication Towers, Medical Devices, Household and
Office Power Back (UPS), Powering Robots in Processing Industry.

Lithium-ion batteries can power any electrical application without the need of
physical wires-means wireless.

It's truly mind-blowing what OP has suggested.

Basically, this model has been there since 19th century and it was used to discipline kids and make them obedience.There has been no change ever since.Even though literacy rates of the west are higher,the quality of education has made many students drop out because it doesn't promote any creativity or critical thinking.The side effects of this are depression,ADHD and living unproductive life,of course.

",edu_not_found," It boils down to the high expectations parents force on their wards. Often times it is about projecting their shortcomings on their children - 'Hey I wasn't able to crack this engineering\medicine course, I hope my child does it' So even without understanding what their child wants they go about forcing them to become who they were unable to be!

Although I agree that math and science is not the sole criteria for measuring a kid, I do believe we need it in our lives to understand things around us - what we can do is make it interesting in the lower standards, like a game, so that students don't feel it as a chore. My parents used this method and I found myself engaged in math & science from a very young age.

Even though US follows the Prussian model, they give a whole variety of other things for the child to choose from to help him/her identify their core competency. This is lacking in India though - athough there's a marked change recently albeit only for those who can afford it.

I once an interview with Amartya Sen about how the eclectic environment of Shantiniketan shaped his mind, I've always been interested in the model of 'open', 'interest based' learning. Yes, some things are necessary and have to be compulsory - such as arithmetic and language, even if children are not interested in them.

But all other disciplines should be learned in a sort of mixed way. For example, why separate History and Literature? Why not study the great texts of the past to study about past society and learn the intricacies of great literature? I've always thought this would be an interesting approach. One could do the same for geography, learn stories from different places, then discuss the environment in which they take place.

Science should be more story based too, linked into history and literature, about how human discovered more and more about the world, leading to scientific revolution and the world of today.

All this can only happen when school occurs in a more relaxed atmosphere. I like the idea of not having rows, perhaps we should have more garden based learning, something like the Ashramas of old, with lessons and sport intermixing, with perhaps theatre and dance, singing, etc.

All this sounds too utopian, but maybe schools can start by designating one month for such kind of learning and see the results. Education needs reform though, even the most radical ideas should not be rejected out of hand. Wait the answer is not track all students using aadhar? /s Finlands made great strides in this area, look for talks by pasi sahlberg. I do not think reform is needed.
We just require better teachers.  > One way India could reform **it's** education

Who even comes up with this stuff! : that one day you'd be stopped and asked to recite a Sanskrit couplet, and that it would be a source of embarrassment.

> During a meeting with leaders of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) last week, the Union culture minister Mahesh Sharma and HRD Minister Smriti Irani pledged to remove all traces of western culture from India by launching a nationwide movement.

RSS made a deal with modi, if BJP comes to power they will dictate cultural agenda of the Government. Then they put their stooges in ministries that influence the following:

> school curricula, art and cinema, science and technology and libraries

That's why Smriti Irani is HRD minister instead of Yashwant Sinha or some qualified politician.

These stooges report direct to RSS and have regular meetings with people from RSS to give them progress cards and take directions from them.

Systematically all organisations have been taken over :

1. IITs (Baba Ramdev incident in IIT Delhi)
2. CBSE(Dinanath batra)
3. Censor board
4. History research grants commission
5. NSD
6. FTII
    and many others.

The most worrying part in all of this they have agendas for ""Science and Technology"" is part of their agenda.

Just read this article published in Nature:

http://www.dailyo.in/technology/narendra-modi-nature-journal-science-csir-madhukar-garg-icmr-greenpeace-biotech-space-research/story/1/3726.html

http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Four-top-scientific-institutes-have-been-headless-for-months/articleshow/46649366.cms

To further their ""patriotism and hinduism"" agenda it means they need money and this is coming from budget cuts for research endeavours.

If somebody doesn't respect the international peer reviewed version of science & technology by calling it ""westernized"" then India will definitely fall behind others when budget cuts are made and research output is thought of as bogus ""westernized"" research. This can be seen by the fact that for the history research grants commission a person without one peer reviewed paper was made head.

Even highly patriotic countries with language barriers like Japan, South Korea and China believe in the international science system. 

If we go down this road further one has to believe that we will produce less and less scientific output and become like Pakistan or the middle east in terms of science and technology. kuch ni hoga. That's it. I'm outta here. I am against Indian Culture because these are the proponents of Arjuna as a great warrior and Drona as a great student. Mahabali was a just ruler and all people were without caste or creed yet he was banished to pathala because he dared challenge the Aryans. Actually, Ekalavya was better than Arjuna and Drona and we should have named awards after him. Indian Culture encouraged giving girls to sexual slavery in temples and It was Amy Carmichael who rescued them. Yet not a single university is named after her. Ida Scudder was a great soul yet no one in India has recognized her efforts in bringing about CMC vellore. BOth Ida and Amy were foreign Christian Missionaries and because of that the Indian society has ostracized them. Shame on this Indian Society. I want Modi's BJP and Congress to recognize this and give Bharat Ratna to both Ida Scudder and Amy Carmichael. I am a low caste and I would like to thank Indian Society for calling me a melecha because I eat beef and pork. to cleanse western cullture we have to throw away the atomic knowledge gained from westerners like James Chadwick and  Thomson. Besides this RSS people want to live in 13 th century  So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wouldn't this be cause problems to his Make-in-India plan? Every time we vote, we get idiots. Elections are guaranteed to give us idiots. Why vote? ""So does western culture also include the intense consumerism driven by neo-liberal economics? The same consumerism which is destroying the environment, driving inequality and creating more slave labor everyday?""

""Oh no, that we love about the west, we just mean rap music""  What else would you expect from an illiterate idiot who did not even pass 10th standard? This country of idiots deserves this. My children will not be growing up in this shit-hole. What a generic piece of crap is this. OP paka mat yaar  Except for hedonism and embracing promiscuity as the norm ,I feel western culture is just inherently superior. So they are going to ban Idol worshiping and arraigned marriages, English language and computers ?  Wrong priorities.

The only thing they should do is to remove English and reinstate Sanskrit as the lingua franca of India. And remove the Congi pro-British propaganda still being taught in schools.

Also, haters please note - there is a big difference between Lingua Franca and Majority Language. Two completely different concepts. Lingua franca is what you use when you converse with someone who doesn't understand your mother tongue (like many Indians use English today to speak to each other, Europeans used French earlier, etc.), majority language is just the language that becomes widespread and is spoken by a lot of people.

What I want is Sanskrit to replace English as the means of conversation between people from Indian states and language zones.",2015-09-10 01:23:41

[deleted] ""Lund"" is ahead of IISc. :D Fuck yeah

PS - Always take these rankings with a pinch of salt. They are very much anglo-saxon oriented and each of them use different metrics. 
For e.g. - If you consider Munich or Berlin or Z√ºrich, they in the Germanic tradition separate universities of basic learning and universities of technology, which the UK and US mostly don't. All of their big unis do research in and teach all disciplines. But say for .e.g in IISc or at the University of Munich, you don't do technology. That's the domain of the technical universities (Technische Hochschulen or Technische Universit√§ten). If you club them together, then Munich and Berlin would rank in the top 25 based on pure research output and impact. But most of these rankings also consider things like the ratio of international students and gender equality and social impact etc. 

If you want to do a good intensive Master's programme and then a PhD, choose a smaller university. The instructors are more hands-on. I studied at the Uni of Munich and except 2 professors, all the other big guys sent in their post-docs to teach. A friend of mine did her MSc in Neuroscience at the Uni of Edinburgh, and it was just 1 year and just 3 months of thesis. They hardly learnt anything general; it was way too focussed on a few particular topics. And in the same way, choose a doctoral advisor (PI) who is an up and coming star instead of a well-established professor, because the younger guy will be more hands-on because he is in line for big grants and a future Chair at a big Uni.  There was another ranking a few weeks back where the IITs were ranked at 600 right? So is this another ranking? Thanks in advance for clarifying.  IISc: 19 : 81 Female:Male Ratio [deleted] And this institute had to bend over because of ego of the current government. It's a shame that such nice institutes cannot freely decide how they want to teach. The Indian Institute of Science Bangalore is the first Indian university to enter the list.

**View: A compelling case to have Bengaluru as second Indian capital** 

 ______ 
** By Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw **** **

The recent suggestion by

RV Deshpande

, Karnataka's minister for large &amp; medium industries and infrastructure
development, that

Bengaluru

be given the status of a second capital of

India

has sparked off an interesting debate.

For a country as vast and ethnically diverse as India, I believe there is a
compelling case to create a southern capital for all the reasons that
Deshpande has outlined in his letter to the prime minister.

The concept of two capital cities is not uncommon: nearly 15 countries across
the world have multiple capitals. For instance, Bolivia, Georgia and the
Netherlands have two capitals! South Africa has three capitals ‚Äî Bloemfontein,
Cape Town, and Pretoria ‚Äî that house its judicial, legislative and executive
branches.

Bengaluru's strongest claim to being India's second capital lies in its status
as the country's science and technology (S&amp;T) hub. It's only our
scientific prowess that can help propel India into a higher growth orbit.

Bengaluru boasts a mature S&amp;T ecosystem, which has attracted several MNCs
to invest in the city to conduct their R&amp;D operations. The government,
industry and academia here have provided the impetus for the development of
the S&amp;T sector in terms of the availability of a scientific workforce,
world-class R&amp;D infrastructure and investor-friendly policies.

The information technology and biotechnology booms have engendered a strong
entrepreneurial culture in the city. Bengaluru is already the ""Science
Capital"", ""Startup Capital"", ""IT Capital"" and ""Biotechnology Capital"" of the
country.

By proposing it as a second capital, the intent is not to duplicate the
administrative infrastructure with overlapping jurisdictions, but rather to
have a more efficient and optimal distribution of ministries between New Delhi
and Bengaluru. It means leveraging the core competence of Bengaluru as India's
Knowledge Capital.

The city possesses the kind of intellectual capital that can drive the
evolution of forward-looking, next-generation policies that will enable India
to leapfrog to global leadership in S&amp;T. There is a strong case for
implementing over the next five years a plan to relocate the science-related
ministries from New Delhi to Bengaluru. These ministries will benefit
immensely from the scientific culture of the city. It will also help the
government in keeping its ear to the ground when formulating policies.

The success of India's space programmes is due in large measure to the
Department of Space being based in Bengaluru. Housing the ministries of
science &amp; technology and electronics &amp; information technology in
Bengaluru would throw open many new avenues for closer collaboration that can
lead to greater success of these sectors. For instance, agencies like Unique
Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), if located in Bengaluru, can
benefit immensely from the large IT ecosystem and the rising status of the
city as the data science hub of the country.

As India's Science Capital, Bengaluru can be the epicentre for pushing India
towards a more digital and formalised economy, while enabling e-governance and
participatory policy-making through the government's

Digital India

initiative. Currently, the southern states feel alienated when it comes to a
redress of issues and policymaking.

As a second centre of administrative power, Bengaluru can help ease the burden
of governance through greater expediency and efficiency.

By giving Bengaluru the status of India's second capital, not only will the
Indian government help unleash the huge potential of the country's innovative
S&amp;T prowess, it will also send out a strong signal that the South is a
very integral part of the country.

> * India's premier defence research agency's missile tech unit signs an MoU with the Tirumala temple to conduct scientific research on Vedas.

> * Now, the Narendra Modi government is taking it all to the logical end.India's premier defence research agency the Defence Research & Development Organisation (DRDO) has gone right ahead to sign a memorandum of understanding with the cash-rich Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanam (TTD) to conduct scientific research on the Vedas to scout for possible secrets pertaining to missile technologies hidden in the ancient scriptures.The MoU with TTD was signed by the Hyderabad-based Research Centre Imarat (RCI)-DRDO to conduct scientific research on the Vedas.

> * But nothing has been conclusively proved so far.In fact, a 1974 study titled ""A critical study of the work Vymanika Shastra"" (Science of aeronautics),conducted by researchers of the Indian Institute of Science into 'ancient scriptures' pertaining to aviation technologies claimed to have been handed down by Sage Bharadwaj, were actually found to be a modern works, somewhere between 1918 and 1923.The study, which was then published in the journal Scientific Opinion on four 'planes' described in Vymanika Shastra - Shakuna Vimana, Sundara Vimana, Rukma Vimana and Tripura Vimana - and claimed to have been given by the ancient sage, were at best ""poor concoctions rather than expressions of something real"".

> * ""None of the planes has properties or capabilities of being flown; the geometries are unimaginably horrendous from the point of view of flying; and the principles of propulsion make them resist rather than assist (in) flying,"" the researchers said in their study's conclusions.They also concluded that the texts and the drawings did not correlate with each other ""even thematically"", suggesting that such claims were only figments of imagination by the author.Similarly, none of the mythological claims to high-end technologies in the ancient Indian past have found scientific basis despite various studies being conducted on the issue.The TTD has established the Centre for Veda Science Research (CVSR) for promoting research in the field and has recognised seven patasalas as 'centres of excellence' in Vedic studies to give a fillip to oral tradition of dissemination of Vedas.Eminent scientists will guide the project, but no further details were available on who they might be.The President inaugurated a new Veda Pathasala (school) set up by the TTD at I Bheemavaram village in Akiveedu Mandal of West Godavari district.The TTD has constructed I Bheemavaram Vedic School at a cost of Rs 4.7 crore.

Insas rifle- Modified Israel rifle.

Rustam UAV- what is that? A card board toy plane? The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) is already tom-tomming its ongoing development of a 10-kilowatt DEW against UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) like targets, with ‚Äúthe establishment of critical technologies of precision tracking/pointing and laser beam combination‚Äù.

Science/Technology,Calculus created in India 250 years before Newton: study - Technology & Science,148,2p81f0,http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/calculus-created-in-india-250-years-before-newton-study-1.632433,146,,sjain75," Awesome! I read about this sometime back, but it was speculation and not the conclusion of a study then.

Anyone interested in reading viewpoints such as of these researchers should read The Indian Clerk, a book about Ramanujan and his time in England. People are arguing that the Taylor series was proof of invention of calculus. Bitch pls. Be proud if you want to but get your facts right.

While I understand that the Taylor series is a very important concept in calculus, it isn't necessary to combine the ideas of infinitesimal sums and differences, convergence, divergence and limits to get to it. The form newton and leibnitz fought over inventing was one which had these concepts (as evidenced by newton promptly using it for his kinematics work).

So no, in the true sense, I wouldn't call this the invention of calculus. But it's an absolutely important step there nonetheless... something which neither newton nor leibnitz had set eyes on, so careful before you start accusing them of plagiarizing.  These are REAL Indian achievements. I have no idea why the wingnuts insist on tom-tomming the Taj as a Shiv mandir when there actually are real things to be proud of.  Really, this is new? I thought Madhava and the taylor series has been known for a quite a while now. Newton wasn't even the 1st European to develop the calculus.  A better title would be ""Medieval scientists in Kerala invented Infinite Series centuries before the West"".

This is indeed admirable, but please do remember that calculus isn't just about infinite series, the concept of limits, infinitesimal small changes and their infinite sums is crucial. Infinite series is just one part of the stepping stones to calculus.

Regardless, this is definitely something to be proud about. It's interesting to see proper research into the Indian history of the maths, sciences and economics; since this is severely lacking in our narratives of history. However, using clickbaity headlines is a bit disingenuous, but to be expected. It is a 2007 article, going by the date.

>""There were many reasons why the contribution of the Kerala school has not been acknowledged,"" he said. ""A prime reason is neglect of scientific ideas emanating from the Non-European world, a legacy of European colonialism and beyond.""

>However, he concedes there are other factors also in play.

>""There is also little knowledge of the medieval form of the local language of Kerala, Malayalam, in which some of most seminal texts, such as the Yuktibhasa, from much of the documentation of this remarkable mathematics is written,"" he admits.

I think Mr Gevarghese George, who sounds like an Indian, has got his primes mixed up. The Brits were rather interested in what we had discovered and what we believed, if the Journal of the Asiatic Society is anything to go by. I would say that the prime reason is what he accepts as 'other factors', something for which the blame lies squarely at our own feet.

I think we have done much more than just this - in Advanced Mathematics and Astronomy. And then let it all go to seed ... This is mentioned in Wikipedia. 

>In the 14th century, Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama and the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics stated components of calculus such as the Taylor series and infinite series approximations. However, they were not able to combine many differing ideas under the two unifying themes of the derivative and the integral, show the connection between the two, and turn calculus into the powerful problem-solving tool we have today

The researcher of this article is George Gheverghese Joseph from Kerala. 

 V INVANTED CALCULUSS [removed] Shocked that I haven't seen a **so prod v invant** comment here so far. 

Anyway, now that Western scientists have put this matter to rest, I am sure our fellow randians are convinced. Otherwise we would have seen a bunch of disparaging comments about the people who say anything along these lines. Secular feathers will be ruffled. Kya ukhaad liya calculus invent karke Everytime someone comes out with statements like this (especially if they are right), the natural question that arises is - then what the f*** are we doing with our garbage heap of an education system, rote learning, utter absence of creativity, and spectacles like a daytime drama queen (literally) as the person in charge of education, chokehold of bureaucracy, anaemic support for higher education, and research (0.7% vs. 3% of GDP that all of our competitors have)? It must have been invented we had a very skilled and glorious past. Even scientists today r baffled by indian architecture which was created in past. The ashoka pillar is the iron pillar standing in open since years without any rust, and taj mahal ajanta ellora paintings etcetc. But sad truth is today we are a third world country with poverty population explosion and corruption. Just coz ur father was a rich n successfull businessman doesnt mean u keep on doing nothing and encash on his name hope this is clear Not sure, why we always want to compare our civilization with western one. Seems like we still have the inferiority complex because western one ruled over us. 

We know  India is one of the oldest and great civilization. A lot of was discovered and invented in India. But can we focus on how what we are today. Even if Calculus was created in India, no one can deny that Leibniz, Newton and western civilization reinvented it, documented it, promoted it, applied it and made it part of math curriculum. 

So even if India  created calculus, stop finding reasons for how great we were, and discuss on how can be great today.
 Calculus is INDIAN^Mlecch_Certified where is the anti kulcha people now Doesn't matter, because Issac Newton was Indian too. He was kidnapped from Yamuna vaidhshalaya (university) and brainwashed by white people. His real name was Isayu Nathuram. Look it up on Subramanian Swamy's facebook page if you don't beleive me. So we inveneted calculus either way. so prod of r kulcha Doesn't matter. Issac Newton (Ishant Nutan) was actually of Indian origin. His father had emigrated from India.  That is why his father forced Ishant to learn Sanskrit which was responsible for Ishant creating Calculus. ITT : not history not a lot of math, does not compute at all.",2014-12-14 15:06:33

Prime minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs pledge to place India among the top three countries in the world in the field of science and technology (S&T) by 2030‚Äîannounced at the Indian Science Congress in Tirupati earlier this month and reiterated at the Nobel prize exhibition in Ahmedabad this week‚Äîis a fine sentiment. But it is also a grandiose one. Getting even part-way there is going to take some doing. India performs below its potential on just about every indicator of scientific progress and achievement there is: be it the amount of public and private funding earmarked for research, the number of prestigious awards won by Indian scientists working in Indian institutions, the number of patents registered in the names of Indians or the number of articles published in well-known peer-reviewed journals.

India has a long civilizational history of scientific achievement. But today the list of Indian scientists who have won the world‚Äôs most prestigious award, the Nobel, begins and ends with C.V. Raman. The longer list of Indian-origin and Indian-born winners has 16 mentions‚Äîbut that also only highlights the large-scale systemic failures that extend across institutions and manifest at all levels.

Only time will tell if the Modi government will be able to put in motion the revamp he has spoken of. But for now, there are early indicators that give us some idea of the government‚Äôs plans and priorities.

First is the government‚Äôs focus on improving science education at the school level: In Ahmedabad, Modi spoke of scientists helping develop course modules while in Tirupati, he mentioned scientific social responsibility wherein premier laboratories and research institutions could partner with nearby schools and colleges to create an environment that supports scientific education and innovation. This is well and good. But these are in the nature of vague, broad ideas, when what is needed is foundational work on the overall education system.

A human resource and development ministry report tabled in Parliament last month noted that as many as a million teaching positions in government schools across the country are lying vacant; successive status of education reports by the non-profit Pratham have highlighted how educational outcomes among Indian school students are falling at an alarming rate.

The situation in institutions of higher education is hardly any better. Elite institutions such as the IITs are the exception, and they too struggle to compete globally. In the QS World University Rankings 2016-17, only two Indian institutions ranked among the top 200 universities in the world: Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (rank 152) and Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi (rank 185). Research institutions also suffer from government interference and lack of funding which, among other problems, makes them unattractive to rising talent that prefers greener pastures abroad.

The second issue that the government is focusing on is strengthening the links between S&T and industry. If done right, this could potentially bring in the resources necessary to boost Indian science. Currently, much of the funding comes from the government while private-sector investment (in the form of research and development centres, for example) is below par. Overall, despite talk since the late 1980s of increasing S&T investments from the public and private sector to 2% of GDP (gross domestic product), the figure still hovers at around 0.9%. In comparison, South Korea leads the race, investing 3% of its GDP in S&T, while Japan follows close behind.

Another example is tiny Israel, which has not only nurtured a flourishing S&T ecosystem but leveraged its security challenges to build a robust defence industry. In India, it will be interesting to see if the Modi government‚Äôs flagship scheme to boost domestic manufacturing and its consequent efforts to woo foreign capital (specifically in defence) can do something similar.

Against this backdrop, it was perhaps in the fitness of things that the Nobel exhibition, which brought nine Nobel laureates on one platform in Ahmedabad, was organized in association with an investment summit to underline how science, technology and innovation hold the key to enterprise and entrepreneurship. The event is part of the larger Nobel Prize Series‚Äîand can be seen as part of the government‚Äôs larger effort to make science more glamorous. But talk is cheap. If there is to be real progress, it will need unglamorous, ground-level work. Fetishizing the Nobel as an end in itself‚Äîas Andhra Pradesh chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu did last week when he announced Rs100 crore in prize money for anyone from his state who wins the prize‚Äîwill not be enough.

All religions in India get incredibly butthurt when people try to debunk bullshit in them. And every political party caters to the regressive superstitions and practices of one of the other.

Other than that it's quite sad to see otherwise educated people believe in moronic miracles - like mary statue weeping tears (proved to be sewer water) or ganesha statues drinking milk (capillary action I think). Yeah, they are pretty active on Telugu news channels.  And the ones who are in it are Senior professors from National Institute of Techonology (NIT), Warangal, Telangana. And several other prestegious institutes. They also try to promote science and scientific thinking in children. I remember attending a session a long time ago when I was in High School.

With Smriti Irani, you could have gotten something memorable like:

""Indian pundits had flown to Pluto in a vimaana and mapped the surface. It surprisingly looks like my arse. Brown, round, cold, and with almost nothing substantial ever coming out of it. So, when people think that I insult academicians by yelling at them, I am actually trying to make them into modern astronomers by asking them to lick and observe my fat arse at close quarters. If it was not against our kulcha, I would moon you all.""

The Lucknow University Senate needs to be careful about quality control. Maybe schedule their convocations when Irani is available?

/s Wow. It's crappy articles like this that make even rightful BJP-bashing seem uncalled for. This is a case of extremely bad paraphrasing.

[Here's](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/home-minister-rajnath-singh-hails-ancient-indian-contributions-to-science-maths/articleshow/45940516.cms) the same story from The Economic Times in case anyone's interested. > ""Many times our media is confused. They say that US observatory has informed about lunar and solar eclipse on a particular date...Don't look at an observatory, ask any Pundit next to you. They will open the 'Panchang' (Hindu calendar) and tell you the dates of eclipse 100 year ago and also 100 years hence,"" Rajnath Singh said while addressing the convocation of Lucknow University here, reported PTI.

The title is clickbait-y but who gives a crap if a pundit can tell you when the eclipse is? Why does it matter. 

>""Our saints had said that earth existed 1.96 arab (billion) years ago. Earlier, science did not accept this but later it had to. What they tell is run by our channels. They should have asked Pundits,"" he said praising ancient Indian knowledge.

Just a simple google search shows that the age of Earth is ~4.5 billion years old. That's why science didn't accept it. Do speechwriters even fact check?

>Stating that no other country possesses the knowledge, which India has, Rajnath Singh said be it theorems of trigonometry, algebra or others no other country could match our knowledge.

I think anyone with a math textbook can match our knowledge. It's not some closely guarded secret. If he's talking about historically, then it's out of my area of knowledge. 

>""When knowledge is cut-off from traditional values, it becomes disastrous. Civilizations which get cut-off from their traditions and values do not survive for long. It was India which showed a big heart and gave message of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam (the world is one family),"" he said.

Uhh what? I think history has shown that, people who stick to their ""traditions"" instead of adapting to a changing world, are the ones who die out. 

>Objecting to ""hi and bye culture"", the minister asked students not to indulge in it and instead follow traditions and touch feet of their parents and elders.

>""Today, youths say 'hi and bye' even to their parents. Instead, they should touch parents' feet as a mark of respect,"" Singh said, adding that ""Jo jhukna nahi jaante, woh toot jaate hain"".

LOL. 

If I had to listen to this sanctimonious bullshit on my graduation day then I would seriously annoyed. Reads like a love letter to a kulcha warrior. This is worse than the last graduation I went to when I had to hear Sashi Tharoor bloviate about his foreign trips and people he met.  everyone please join the anti right circlejerk thread, let us all bash the chaddis. 

no /s Actually our vedas and culture contain all knowlez about everything in the universe. The west stole everything and looted the sone ki chidiya that was once bharat. They not only looted this knowlez but also our wealth and make peoples suffer.  I feel like banging my head on the wall right now. >they will open the 'Panchang' (Hindu calendar) and tell you the dates of eclipse 100 year ago and also 100 years hence

Well... Isn't that true? I thought the Hindu calendar had accurately calculated eclipse dates?

Also, I'm having trouble finding the direct quote where he says that ""An Indian pundit know more about lunar and solar eclipses than any US observatory""

I just want to exercise a little caution before jumping on the ""ZOMG V INVANT"" bandwagon And this guy has a Masters in Physics *sigh*",2015-01-20 06:27:16

>* The official said the move to fund such centres will help the institutes generate additional revenue with creation of intellectual property rights (IPRs).An official at DST said the government has raised the budget for innovation and entrepreneurship to Rs 180 crore from Rs 40 crore last year.

>* However, the institute's director, SK Das, said, ""We are internally ready for a research park and intend to push for this again.

 I will forever be grateful to BJP if they let Hinduism alone. But who am I kidding?  But 2002!

Modi's haters will keep scaremongering about how he will start an orgy of Muslim blood and destroy India.

And whenever he proves them wrong(which is always) they will desperately go back and rake up 2002 again.

This will be their fate for the remainder of their natural lives. They will still be talking about 2002 in 2052. Fuck the elections. You want to see who wins? See who's the friendliest towards the West. Which almost always means they ignore the people. The US has all of their telemarketers and troubleshooters here, they dump all their plastic garbage not far from Chennai, and we provide Trillions in education money and then we stay back there to fill their coffers.

  A number of schemes will be taken up under NIDHI, including NIDHI Prayas, which is focused on addressing the gap between idea and prototype funding.  

 

  Under this scheme, the department plans to set up 10 Prayas centres across incubation centres supported by it. The other schemes include NIDHI Seed Support System for funding early-stage startups and NIDHI Centres of Excellence, which will help startups go global.  

 

  

 

  Harkesh Mittal, head of the National Science and Technology Entrepreneurship Development Board at the Department of Science and Technology said: ""DST will soon revise the total funding limit to startups at supported incubators from up to Rs 50 lakh to Rs 1 crore. The revised investment limit is soon to be implemented."" The department provides the seed amount per startup in the form of a grant to the incubator. The incubator in turn invests the same in the form of debt or equity in the companies.  

 

  DST, which has so far supported 100 technology-focused incubators across the country, plans to support another 15-20 incubators this year.  

 

  It usually supports incubators with grants up to Rs 15 crore to set up an incubator, with the amount varying according to city and type of startups the incubator is catering to, among other factors.

  By Amit Kapoor  

 

  A special ""Nobel Series"" session was a notable addition at the latest Vibrant Gujarat Summit (January 9-12).  

 

  Nine laureates were invited to share their thoughts about the challenges of humankind and what could be done to alleviate them. A Nobel exhibition is housed in Ahmedabad's Science City for five weeks post the summit. The scientists discussed the importance of science and technology for India to become a knowledge superpower. They also interacted with students and shared their research and general approach to science and technology.  

 

  While all this bodes well for the rise of Indian states in the global arena, what is important is that, of late, Indian states are recognising the need for not only inviting creative individuals but also trying to enable an ecosystem that helps people grow and make the best of every opportunity.  

 

  A question is: Why foster science and technology or even creativity? Many scholars, economists and public policy professionals have devoted considerable time on understanding the sources of a nation's prosperity. Some of them opine that economic prosperity arises as a result of ""institutions"" while others argue that factors like endowments and geographic location are equally important. More recently, other scholars believe that productivity is the basis of economic growth and prosperity.  

 

  Recently, scholars like Richard Florida of the Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) at the University of Toronto have pointed out that the rise of the ""creative class"" could help explain the prosperity and economic development in some parts and the lack of it in other parts of the world. ""Creative class"", according to Florida, is a group of people engaged in creative occupations. These people, when given the right environment and ecosystem, enable innovation, which is the main driving force for economic development.  

 

  Urbanisation and the progress in technology over the past two/three centuries have meant that the flow of ideas and sharing of information can now be done much more quickly. This has led to the rise of the knowledge economy.  

 

  For tracking these developments, Florida and his MPI team have created a Global Creativity Index. The report is based on the 3T framework that forms the basis of economic progress within the city/state -- Tolerance, Talent and Technology -- that in turn leads to economic prosperity. If one looks at the most recent version of the Global Creativity Report 2015 one finds that most developed economies perform well -- Australia is on top, followed by the US, while Singapore, the only Asian nation in the top 10, is at 9, followed by the Netherlands. Also the share of the creative class in many North American and West European countries is closer to 40 percent.  

 

  Contrast this with India's performance -- 99th in a list of 120+ nations -- and there is scope for tremendous improvement. One of the reasons for this low performance is that the share of the creative class is quite low in India. This is due to an issue of quality education and skilling and outflow of people who receive good education. Less than five percent of the Indian workforce is formally skilled. The gross enrolment ratio is also quite low in India.  

 

  India is relatively good in the technology component but bad in the tolerance and talent domains. Even the BRICS as a block is not especially impressive with a diverse range of rankings. Brazil ranks the highest in the Creativity Index within the block at 29. Russia is outstandingly bad in the tolerance aspect.  

 

  The Institute for Competitiveness and Martin Prosperity Institute had previously tied up for research on India's ""Creative Class"". The research and ranking of the Creative Economy of Indian States was done recently.  

 

  The broad findings remain the same as last year. This year we have added a classification of Union Territories and separation from other states.  

 

  Delhi and Chandigarh retain rank 1 and 2, respectively, in the city-states/Union Territory category. Punjab moves to top spot this year from the previous years' third position (in the main states index) pushing down Kerala and Goa. States like Bihar and Orissa are bad performers overall and but have tremendous opportunity to move up in the years to come.  

 

  The maximum negative variation is found in states like Himachal Pradesh, which has moved down six places. Haryana has seen an upward movement of seven places, thus showing significant improvement in performance. States that have moved up in the ranking include Gujarat and Karnataka. The rankings among the Union Territories remained unchanged from the last year.  

 

  In the years ahead, India's economic prosperity will be driven by states and Union Territories and locations and cities within these that are creative. States that do well to foster the creative class will in turn be instrumental in driving innovation and economic progress.

Give so much of money, and you'll have THIS MUCH! So BioCon wants the government to setup more research centers and universities? Does BioCon fund any professor chairs or labs today? If not, then all they are asking is taxpayers money to be spent in research which could then be sold by corporations for profits. I could be simplifying. Correct me if I'm wrong. Need $5 billion more to make biotech a $100 billion sector: Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw

---

>* BENGALURU: Biocon chief Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw today said it will take an investment worth $5 billion in biotechnology to realise the target of making it a $100 billion sector by 2025.

>* ""Today, biotechnology is a $11 billion sector, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 20 per cent.

>* We also are aspiring to be a $100 billion sector by 2025,"" Mazumdar-Shaw said.Though this seems a ""fairly daunting task"", she said, adding that ""by investing in human capital and in the sector alone in terms of infrastructure and other research initiatives, I think we can actually deliver on this aspiration.

>* ""Mazumdar-Shaw, also the Chairperson of Karnataka Vision Group on Biotechnology, was speaking at the inauguration of 16th edition of 'Bangalore India Bio 1016' here.The event was also attended by Union Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan and Secretary in Department of Biotechnology K Vijay Raghavan, among others.Stating that India's investment in science and technology is at suboptimal level, she called on the government to invest more.

>* ""We request you (Harsh Vardhan) to push the government to make sure that our investment in science and technology only grows and increases, because this is the future of India, this is what will give us demographic dividend from our scientists,"" she added.The three-day long ""Bangalore India Bio"" will be covering various spectrum of activities including multi track conferences, international trade show, key note talks, poster sessions, bio invest, global biotech conclave, among others.She said to dominate in the field such as biotechnology and information technology what is paramount is human capital, which will actually shape India's science and technology prowess in the world.

Science/Technology,"Universities must have more academic freedom, autonomy, says PM Narendra Modi",32,2r7wrb,http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/universities-must-have-more-academic-freedom-autonomy-says-pm-narendra-modi/1/214202.html,14,,janupbhoteyojana," >**""We want our scientists to explore the mysteries of science and not of government procedure,""** Modi said, while inaugurating the 102nd Indian Science Congress in Mumbai.
""Our institutions of research must become more broad based. Our universities must have a higher degree of academic freedom and autonomy,"" Modi said.
**In turn the universities must also subscribe to highest standards of academic excellence and accountability**, Modi said.

We'll have to wait to find out what that emboldened bit means in terms of specifics I guess...

On the administrative policy aspect

> ""As the major source of science and technology, government must do its part. When I speak of ease of doing business in India, I also want to pay equal attention to the ease of doing research and development in India,"" Modi said.

and

>**The Prime Minister said each government department should have an officer focusing on science and technology relating to its area of work and, allocate a percentage of its budget for such activities.**

(Awesome!)

and

>""We have to place the university system at the cutting edge of the research and development activities in the country,"" he added.

... as opposed to moribund government institutes? Cool. One difference being access to student population, and their talents. This demographic is still unencumbered by the livelihood phase, and is living in a setting where their only real responsibility is to learn. (Leading to a system where enthusiasm is fostered, rather than let wither)

Moving on... the PM, *possibly* on the parenting and socio-cultural aspect, says

>Emphasising the need to popularise science and technology, he said, ""Our children should see role models in scientists as much as in sportsmen.""

&
 
>""You will have no better supporter than me. In turn, I seek your help in transforming India,"" Modi said as he told the scientific community that their achievements should be celebrated ""as much as we rejoice in our success in other areas"".
""We need to put science, technology and innovation at the top of national priorities. Above all, we must restore the pride and prestige of science and scientists in our nation,"" the Prime Minister said.

A re-iteration of the publicly-acknowledged (though spurned in private) view. I still would like someone to simply pitch the awesomeness of science to the public - as a standalone... and not tied to pride, or its use for development, or national supremacy... but I guess this'll do for now.

Modi on the legislative policy aspect.

>He also called for clear regulatory policies for research and development in areas like biotechnology, nano-science, agriculture and clinical research.

There are other issues too, but his mention has now gotten me thinking: what is the Hindu religion stand on stem-cell research? (Or abortion for that matter?) Or genetic modification etc. etc.?

The PM's other observations in the developmental/fiscal/economical aspects

>A nation's progress and development is linked to science, Modi said.

&

>The Prime Minister called upon Indian industry to step up investments in science and technology in its own interest.

&

> **He said India's own pharmaceutical industry has carved out a place for itself in the world, because it invests significantly in research.**

(Are you listening, industry?)

>China's emergence as the second biggest economy is parallel to that country's strides in science and technology, he added.

The usual stuff, but I think I hear Western Pharma company CEOs, the WTO, and western patent lawyers turning in their graves. (They can continue to do so AFAI'm concered though). But yes, do Indian pharma firms really invest that much in R&D? As in IP generating R&D? As opposed to number-crunching processing/experimentation centres that use cheaper labour, without requiring this labour to do their own directed thinking.

Anyway, he goes on to recognise the historical approach to S&T policy, as well as offer his two cents.

>Modi asked the scientists to incorporate traditional local knowledge to develop more appropriate, effective, sustainable and affordable technologies that contribute immensely to development and progress.
He said the arms of science, technology and innovation must reach the poorest, the remotest and the most vulnerable person.
The PM also felicitated Nobel laureates and Indian scientists on the occasion.

The goal of the Centre is to provide a shared environment to foster new climate, earth, space and marine research

With respect to space, cooperation is expected to include development and cooperation of next generation nano and micro satellites

On marine sciences, the project would enable India to study the atmospheric and ocean behaviour of the Atlantic and its linkages with weather patterns including the monsoon

On joint science and technology fund of 4 million euros:

Speaking on collaboration in cutting-edge technology, Modi announced the setting up of a joint science and technology fund of four million euros. ""Our economic ties continue to follow an upward trajectory, and we can do more for the flow of goods, services, capital and human resources,"" he said, adding that bilateral trade has grown 17 per cent in the past one year.

""We look forward to engaging with Portugal in the Atlantic International Research Centre, both in the Space and Ocean Science fields,"" Modi added.

Other MoUs signed:

Protocol amending the Double Taxation Aviodance Agreement

MoU on Nano Technology MoU on Public Administration and Governance Reforms

MoU on Cultural Cooperation

KOLKATA: A 14-year-old has wowed cityscientistswith her discovery of the impact of the 'Om' sound in reducing fatigue.Anwesha Roy Chowdhury, a Class-IX student ofAdamas World School, topped the recently heldScience Congressorganized by the state government.



Her findings that chanting of 'Om' increases oxygen level in blood and lowers carbon dioxide and lactic acid, which reduces the level of fatigue, were vetted by physics and physiology professors of Calcutta University andJadavpur University. Debashish Bandopadhyay, head of the department of physiology, Calcutta University, told TOI, ""Anwesha's project is innovative, it's quite flawless and convincing.""



An-we-sha, who likes to spell her name thus, since anweshan in Bengal means 'search', told TOI, ""I found that sounds with a particular frequency, if heard or recited right, raises the level of neurotransmitters and hormones like serotonin, dopamine, DHEA etc. Because of their vasodilatory actions, the oxygen level in blood soars. It also produces less lactic acid and allows the person to act without fatigue.""



""In the last decade, the body of research on workout music has swelled considerably, helping psychologists refine their ideas about why exercise and music are such an effective pairing. But this specific finding on the 'Om' sound is impressive,"" said Rina Venkataraman, secretary, state science and technology department.



""No one has ever pin-pointed on the 'Om' sound and conducted such comprehensive experiments on its use,"" Dipankar Das, senior scientist, state science and technology department, said during a workshop conducted on 165 students who were shortlisted for the statewide Science Congress recently.



It all began when Anwesha visited Uttarakhand, where she ""found some priests carrying water from Bageshwar to Kedarnath, covering 68km every day, without tiring. The priests sang a tune all along. There was no way she could reproduce the same mantra for her experiments. So Anwesha started looking for a similar tune.



""Finally, a tune with 430+ Hz frequency clicked. In five experiments in various laboratories, I measured the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels of 17 adults (all on the staff of BITM) while listening to the tune for 30 minutes, and there was an increase of oxygen level and decrease in carbon dioxide in their bodies,"" Anwesha said.

Science/Technology,A place to discuss scientific and engineering research for and by Indians? [Science & Technology],6,5jscfe,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/5jscfe/a_place_to_discuss_scientific_and_engineering/,3,"I've been thinking about this for a while. It would be illuminating to have regular discussions on advanced scientific and engineering research, in the context of India, and amongst the reddit-faring desi junta and interested non-Indians.
 
The topics of discussions could be anything from in-depth technical discussions and debates on a particular research topic, a paper, a government or corporate project to scientific policy, funding & related issues, tips for new researchers etc, if it is spearheaded by Indians (at home or abroad) or is being conducted in India as a part of a global collaboration (e.g., INO).

I am in two minds about what would be a good place for this. One on hand, having a separate subreddit sounds like a good idea to consolidate and stay focused. However, in my experience most Indian subreddits other than randia don't really get much traction and end up dying. I think the goal of such discussions should not only be exchange of ideas and information amongst researchers, but also with a larger audience. Given that /r/India is the largest, most cohesive (heh) agglomeration of desis on reddit, perhaps a discussion thread once/twice a month would be better. Of course, the format and the discussion topics would be more restrained in those threads and won't really be a free-for-all.

I would like to hear suggestions from randian researchers and non-sci/tech folk alike on this. ",Glorious_Comrade, make linkedin or google groups? you always want to link all these with Twitter/fb pages to harmonize and point to the real source Let everything happen in r/india ,2016-12-23 08:34:49

Where do I start? I would like to attend a training course (online preferred) and get certified from an organization like Cloudera in Hadoop/HBase.

My background:
- 3.5+ years of IT experience in a niche tool. Not much jobs here so I am not able to switch :(. 
- Started the coursera course 'Intro to Data Science' last year, but had to leave it halfway due to some reason.

Any help would be much appreciated!",hey_dog," Unsolicited advice - There's an ocean of difference in learning *Data Science* and learning *Data Science Technologies*. Learning Hadoop is *Learning a technology* while learning Distributed Computing/Architecture is learning a science/concept. Why am I stressed on making the distinction? Science/concepts remains but technologies change. It's easier to switch between technologies if you know the science. Vice-versa is possible but difficult.

Since you started the Intro to Data Science on Coursera; Bill Howes from University of Washington (instructor) stressed on this aspect too. Which city are you from? We have a Hyderabad Data Science group (google search for details), I think there is a similar one in Bangalore. No clue about other cities. If you can follow a degree on machine learning, data mining or statistics ( or mathematics ) you would be suited for big data analytics. To be honest, I donot have any knowledge of industry certification; most of my knowledge is from academia. 
In academia, analysis of extremely large data sets , like Facebook, has been studied for some time.  Why did you stop the class last time? And also are you currently employed? Cos Coursera is offering Data Science specialisation and it costs approx 30K. If you can spend weekly 5-6 hours for each 3 courses, you can finish this specialisation within 6-7 months. All the best!

Even I am interested in data and classes commence from April 7th. Enrolled into 3 courses as of now. Paid $150.  screw most of the advice here, so far.

Just do statistics,statistics and more statistics.  At least upto t-tests, F scores.  

Do not worry about hadoop.  Know your stats and numbers; they'll be enough AP guys to code for you in hadoop.

Maths, you either get it or you don't.

without going into details i take 'care' of this area where i used to work.  This thread needs to be relabelled: I heard there is more money in big data. I don't care about the field, just the certificate and a job to fuck up.

Does Arnab Goswami and his chums have the balls to question this? If this is not compromise, then I don't know what is. What is the point of majority if you still reward corrupt assholes.

This is why BJP supporters, the moderate centrists (swing vote), need to start being more vocal critics of poor govt. decisions. Some very questionable souls have crept into the Cabinet and people are so consumed by the Modi hype, that they don't bother to question. I am more sad than happy with this.

> * India's Forensic Science Laboratory is in negotiations to purchase the security bypassing technology used by Israeli mobile software developer Cellebrite, the company that the FBI enlisted to help unlock the iPhone of the San Bernardino shooter earlier in the year (via The Economic Times ).The FBI needed Cellebrite's ""mobile forensics solutions"" to bypass the lock on the iPhone 5c in question, a method which Apple vehemently opposed throughout the lengthy public spat between it and the U.S. Justice Department.Cellebrite has worked with government and law enforcement agencies ""around the world,"" and the FBI's interaction with the company was reported earlier in the year to cost somewhere around $1 million.

> * The terms of India's purchasing agreement with Cellebrite were not laid out, but an anonymous official from the Forensic Science Laboratory said that the Indian government is expected to get the unlocking technology fairly soon.As the FSL official mentioned, after its purchase of Cellebrite India intends to become the ""global hub"" for cases similar to the one between Apple and the FBI that occurred this year, since it will now own the ""entire tool"" to open encrypted smartphones.

> * It's mentioned, although not in much detail, that requests the FSL receives by other institutes to unlock a smartphone ""will be entertained at a fee.

> * ""It's not clear how India's purchase will be different from anyone else's, or what would lead the country to become a ""global hub"" when others can also seek out help from Cellebrite.Despite the FBI eventually finding nothing of importance in the San Bernardino iPhone, the political and technological climate surrounding the case will continue because encryption is "" essential tradecraft "" of terrorists, according to FBI director James Comey.

We are a united and secular country in 2016 and the credit for all of it goes only to Nehruji.. He tried to maintain state control over R&D. Which resulted in mostly failure. The only Institution that succeeded was ISRO, and to a certain extent DRDO. All the other institutions became assembly plants for imported technology. Another point to note is that, early on there was more stress on humanities and literature, rather than science and technology. The focus on Science and Tech only came after Rajeev Gandhi's time. But again resulted in massive brain drain, as the Indian markets were too closed to allow for any kind of innovation.

Coming from a leading science and technology institute in the country, I would like to add few more things on the topic. There is a Professor in my department, who, despite his excellent career record of over 20+ years, with number of publications and supervision of doctoral studies in his kitty, still remains an ""assistant professor"" due to internal politics! Extraordinarily brilliant research scholars are rotting away their lives in dingy labs even after the stipulated 5 year time frame for PhD studies, sometimes due to department policy that sets a limit to the number of PhDs that can be awarded in an academic year, but more often due to Profs not wanting to let go of the hardworking youngsters who churn out 4 to 5 technical papers every year! There are many PhD scholars who are married, have kids and dependent parents. Bureaucracy is oblivious to their struggle to make ends meet with the meagre 18000 stipend they get every month! Lack of funding and collaboration with industries cripple the situation even more. A certain Professor, when made head of division, cut off all industrial collaboration and consultancy works that used to fetch a neat income to the department on account of ""trust deficit"". Apparently he was under the impression that these collaborators may put to use the expertise gained from the institute to terrorist activities! This is the pathetic situation of Science and Technology research in India. How can research be expected to thrive in such a discouraging environment when people have plenty of lucrative career options available at home and abroad!

As per the buzz Akshay is going to make movie out of this. He will act as Gopichand. Yay !! Sindhu üòç Congratulations, golden girl. Truly dominant on court. Hope this erases the idea that she always falls one short from people's minds. Goodminton 21-7, 21-7

That's pure dominance! 

This one medal was evading her for so long, In 2013, 2014 she won Bronze, 2017, 2018 she won Silver but 2019 she made sure to clinch nothing but Gold...Brilliant and resilient stuff! üëè [deleted] Her Quarterfinal round with Tai Tzu Ying was a hard fought win, she lost the first round, but went on to beat her in the next 2 to move to Semis. The last 2 sets were pretty close scores too.

Quite surprised by the one sided score line against Okuhara. P V Sindhu <3 <3 She is gonna inspire a whole new generation, for sure. So proud of her.... to lose two finals but then win her third final and that too in such emphatic fashion. No words can describe her achievement. Champüôå Really a proud moment for the nation. This needs more coverage. Girl power in India ! Heartiest congratulations to this strong and magnificent lady! She's doing us real proud! Proud feeling for her üëç Did Carolina Marin play?

Edit: /s -_- Cricketers can go suck a.... Not sure why we guys are so good at individual sports but terrible at team sports. And before you come at me, Cricket (a game) can't be counted as a team sport.

Congrats to Sindhu nevertheless.

EDIT: Thanks for the downboats. Forgot I was in /r/india. You guys can defend it all you like, only 12(?) fucking Commonwealth countries play the 'sport'.

Sports,India‚Äôs Sumit Nagal took down Roger Federer 6-4 in the first set!! Yay!!,2095,cvxqea,https://i.redd.it/yp1w5yi7ewi31.jpg,95,,babloopachisya," 1-1 after two sets but really happy to see an Indian playing singles in the main draw. I remember the French open match between Somdev Devvarman and Nadal 7-8 years ago.

The first two sets were really close but Nadal just upped his game and sailed through.

Damn, what happened to that guy. He showed a lot of promise. It‚Äôs an amazing performance by the young man. Showed a lot of heart. Surpassed my expectations.
Let‚Äôs see if he can keep it up over multiple sets. Move over Nadal, Nagal is the new kid in town! 

All aboard the Nagal hype train, choo choo! This is like teleporting to the final stage boss right after you start the game and actually winning with your shitty blaster He tried his best. Really proud He just lost How do we add a picture of him there ? Next 2 sets Federer has turned it on. Still much more than expected. He gave a good fight, but Federer just proved why he is liked the world over. His first ever set in the US Open and he bested Federer dayum. Hoping he would win the match was wishful thinking imo but this in itself is a great achievement and I hope he continues to grow. damn, Federer really showed him why he's the greatest. Props to Nagal for downing him one set out of four, though! Second set not looking good so far :( Google doesn't even have his pic Is there a live stream? Where can I watch this? Roger Federer won in the end. But Sumit Nagal showed if players like him are given more opportunities they can really defeat the biggest players in the town. Some good shots by the lad. A lot of credit goes to Virat Kohli... 

Confused? 

Virat Kohli Foundation has been helping and inspiring the youth of our country to follow their passion and dreams. They facilitate in providing the much needed help in preparing people like Sumit to scale at tremendous heights.., First Sindhu then this guy. 4-6,6-1,6-2,6-4 final score fyi Sorry, this feels like Ironman versus Thanos.

Can half imagine Fed say in Swiss accent, ""All this for a drop of blood....""

Well played buddy! The guy has the talent, great winner there! Nangal Dam!!!! Headbutting the  Grandmaster himself. Big deal. 

Great Job Sumit Nagal Damn federer is getting his ass kicked left and right last year and this year I wish more people knew about how big a thing this is. There is always a Indian better thn you. Really amazing Performance,feel proud as an Indian. Madlad I am excited that an Indian just 22 years old is showing so much potential but it would have been more glorious if his coaching would have been in India. only nadal or djokovic can match fedrrer Great performance !  The P.V Sindhu Factor Is Strong Lol Does anyone in India care about table tennis anyway? Really proud of sumit!! I wish him all the best! Super Sumit Nagal or Sumit Nadal?????? :))) Holy crap, this is big. Excellent! This is amazing stuff. Way to go Nagal, damn proud you. Ye toh bas shuruvaat hai, keep up good job! It's true though.  We have the most people in the world that deficate outside and on the beaches.  We need to stop doing this.  The internet has brought it to the world.  Im in Bogot√° Colombia and was hitting on a girl and we met like six times then one day in front of all my new friends she pulls some bs up on the computer and shows a YouTube video of us shitting on railroad tracks... Like 100 people walking out of their homes to poo.  Everyone laughed at me so I just left Wow, nice going Sumit! shit I'm watching this now! Kid's got heart! Holy shit balls! hum indians choti choti baaton mein khushiyan dhuoond hi lete hain. Supported by VK! A young guy struggling to keep up against a guy almost twice his age.

&#x200B;

indians, celebrating mediocrity as always. All the big matches are fixed, they wanted to give some spotlight to an Indian so they let him win one set, but that's all they'll give. Oh great... Now parents are going to spend money on their kids tennis lessons instead of teaching them how to not public deficate.  Our country has the biggest public defication crisis in the world",2019-08-27 15:25:27

Sports,The incomplete end of an era.,1430,cc7zis,https://i.redd.it/yduuz9txxt931.jpg,118,,rgaywala," Credits : Krishna Rathi

Original Post can be found on his Instagram handle : rathikrishna42 Is it really an incomplete end of the era? The man literally won everything there is to win in the game as captain, not even as just a player.

&#x200B;

Edit: A word Why do we expect the world from someone? He has achieved so so much but everyone will always talk about how in his last performance he didn‚Äôt do this or that. Sachin has to go through the same. Stop focusing on one thing and look at how far he has come in his career. Indians are just never happy, it‚Äôs sad. They do the same with their kids. At least give a credit who made this. Why did you crop his name. Downvoting as OP cropped out original creator 's name.. that's theft. Why do you have to keep reminding us :( Sigh..Does not matter how cool you are.. This will probably haunt him for years. I cannot imagine the plethora of emotions that would have been going through him since the start of that over. But, a big salute to one of the best captains and readers of the game, India has ever had. An incomplete picture at first because you cropped the artist name. Give credit where it‚Äôs due. This is quite unfair. He'll be remembered as a legend despite his last performance Lol, stop putting people on pedestals. Not incomplete and no end either. 

As a batsman he has slowed down in terms of power hitting but Pandya/ Pant will take over that front (which they should have in the semifinals). He is still as good a batsman you'll get for No 4/ 5, still a fast runner and lighting quick behind the wicket. Like for Federer it's the outsiders who are waiting for the retirement non-stop.

It is Ravi Shastri we need to bid goodbye to and move on. Some people move on Am I the only one who read 'DHOR' üôÜ No its not incomplete. He gave us Worldcup, worldcup 20 20, champion trophies, he is the most successful Indian criket captain in History. He is complete, his era is complete. He will deserve farewell like Sachin whenever he want to retire Its not the end. He will still play in T20 WC. Sorry I read it as Dhor first r/DesignPorn Incomplete? Bro which world are you living in? Or do you have amnesia. He has won everything that had to be won in cricket. Only captain with T20 World Cup, 50 Over World Cup & Champions Trophy. Pardon my language but fuck you for your stupid creative. It's because of ungrateful people who call themselves fans just like you that these cricketers are put under so much pressure to always perform. What have you done in your own uneventful life? Have you ever thought about that? Have you ever completed anything worthy for generations to come? You bro, are shit. There's little or no worth to your existence. I am no Dhoni fanboy but your creative is just dumb, tone deaf and utterly mistaken. Thoda jyada ho gaya [deleted] Wonderful creativity. *an era How you say incomplete Bar bar yaad mat dilao yr. Seriously guys there is no fairy tale ending in life. He got out doing what he did best and that is all that matters. People want everything to be a bollywood movie. I don't think that Dhoni has to rely on some armchair critic telling him how his career was incomplete. He has achieved a lot already. I have myself not been a huge fan of keeping him in the team for the past 6 months, but you have to be foolish to think his career is incomplete. Dhoni is not retiring.

He's not. Okay!? Out of the loop here. Can anyone tell me what exactly happened?

I didnt watch the world cup that's why. Thats how Karma bites you... [deleted] Why tf is everyone saying end of an era? He hasn't even slightly hinted at retiring anytime soon. Is this the doing of his haters? It‚Äôs not the end. He s gonna hang around No worries, he will be there (next worldcup) HOPE [deleted]",2019-07-12 21:33:48

Hotstar still doesn't support surround sound. If only their app was better Hotstar had first launch advantage + they have sport streaming right + lot of free content + good premium too + cheap as compared too others. Maybe because Netflix has jack shit local content. Did they make a single original series in Telugu? Amazon did make at least one. Amazon and HotStar has way way more local movies too.

I cannot splurge on 10-12k stuff and my budget is limited to 3-4k.",theloopsoup," Just any wireless. Sound quality doesnt matter much, because you need to be concentrating on the run. Personally , I use the Skullcandy riff sp5xw- l672  wireless headphones , on Amazon for around  4700 bucks ..great for Running , extremely comfortable and good sound  output as well Jaybird X3, Sweat proof and connect with Apple watch (which comes with 5gb space to sync and store music). > I cannot splurge

>my budget is limited to 3-4k 

&#x200B;

And here I am using Rs 399 wired earphones from Amazon. Sigh. Just search for sports Bluetooth earphones there are a lot of devices out there 

Basically you need to buy something that is waterproof ( so sweat doesn't affect it) and has a great fit so that it doesn't keep coming off when you run 

And sports earphones are designed with those in mind you can find a descent one for around 1500-2500 I bought these cheap $20 wireless earbuds from Aliexpress. They sound decent and won't come off while running.

https://m.aliexpress.com/item/32985227564.html?trace=wwwdetail2mobilesitedetail&spm=a2g0n.ams_82754.m0ae6a8.4.67a04a9bLJRJkP Airpods Boult Bluetooth Try ""tagg inferno"". They have good audio quality and decent battery life. One downside is that they get little uncomfortable if you use them while laying in the bed. But they are perfect for workout activities. If your limit is 3k-4k.
You can go for Huawei Freelace. Not available in India; get it on AliExpress. Jaybird x4, nothing else comes close. Boat is something that i am proud of... within 3k you get good sound and great quality Some ‚Çπ1.5k cheapass from Amazon

Works fine. Wireless JBL by harman Buy a cheaper one, most of the in earphones get spoilt due to sweat, dirt and wax One Plus bullet earphones Boat rockerz 225 Try out the Artis earphones! Pixel earphones. All other earphones have a tendency to fall off. Go for true wireless ones.. lots of options under 4k... Mivi crossbeats , leaf, nurepublic

Just make sure your expectation is right. These dont have large batteries.. i use jlabs which i picked up from an overseas trip.. had the noise shots before.. the battry lasted 3 hrs..

So if ur running for longer or training for a full.. i would suggest spend some more and get a good battery life ones.. Galaxy buds. Mi airdots are down to 1K on aliexpress. Doubt you will find better TWS option the price range. Sony MDRXB510AS wired or jbl endurance run bt for wireless. Park me kaise sound quality bhai. Jo bhi earphones mile Vohi sahi hain My friend uses a boult tru5 and I've heard they're generally good Qcy qs1/t1c CX -180, best under 1000 For running purpose buy 500 600 rs waha things.

I mean howdo you high tarriffs on Tesla and other Electric Vehicles with the lofty claims made by ministers ? Yahan road hai nahi.... RumTum Tesla ki baat kar raberahe ho Do we even have the infrastructure to support electric cars? It's not just import duties. I drive a Tesla. This car won't survive in Indian conditions without heavy modifications. The clearance is too low, the materials and paint too susceptible to the constant battering Indian roads provide, etc.

The core issue remain that they're expensive and this will be just another luxury vehicle that won't sell because the country simply doesn't have the infrastructure to support EVs. Anything that is environment friendly should have no import duties! Then don't import and build it in India. Why is the deer not working lmao? They are high cuz govt don‚Äôt wanna import them. Make them here Electric vehicles and super cars needs better infrastructure which is only seen near airports. If a normal consumer has pot holes and water logging on his street then he won't be encouraged to buy such vehicles. Surprise, let me guess so are taxes and having to pay a wage to workers.  Can't everyone just get on their knees throw money at them and beg for these saviours to grace us China is far ahead of us in electronics manufacturing. Opening the door to imported EVs now would mean killing off the domestic auto industry and ushering in Chinese imports. Further, these EVs are not going to be powered by renewables, they are going to be powered my electricity which is produced in India by burning coal, which is worse than Petrol vehicles, so there is no real environmental benefit in switching to EVs today.

We need to make our electricity grid less dependent on coal and while doing so simultaneously get the infrastructure ready to produce EVs domestically in India so that they are at least somewhat competitive compared to imports, and only then push for their adoption. This means that there needs to be a phased adoption plan which industries can depend on to decide their investments and production targets. 

Allowing Teslas here today at no import duty does not really make any sense. Good. Hopefully, those import duties will stop one of the most exploitative corporation to exploit fellow Indian workers.",2019-08-02 20:06:42

Let‚Äôs just say for arguments sake Indians are not genetically athletic however in a sample size of 1.3 billion people you are going to have very large statistical outliers (I also don‚Äôt think Indians are not genetically inferior especially north Indians) but why haven‚Äôt they been found. China has 2 billion people and has made the most with them.They currently have track runners running 100m times in 9.8s which is enough to medal if not even win the next olympics even if Chinese are not ‚Äúathletic‚Äù in a large sample size there will be elite athletes. So why haven‚Äôt they been found in India. China also wins the second most medals and have also produces players in basketball. I‚Äôm just curious why this is with the population size.,Bigguns26," Since you compare with China, I will paste my comment from an earlier thread

> Chinese government spends $46 billion on sports, while our budget allocation in sports is around $0.5 billion.

India needs massive infrastructure to train and support its athletes. Getting Olympic medals is a long term strategy, you can't just wake up one day and hope to win a medal. Just look at Mr. Bindra and the amount of time and money he invested to win his gold medal. We need world's top coaches to train our elite athletes, which needs $$$. Culture and history: Not many role models and viable career pathways hence low base  . The cliche of a billion people is just that a cliche without substance . Very few young people engage in sports, for starters need encourage kids to play but many schools don't have playgrounds .So parents are worried about kids future and discourage  them China does not have 2 billion people, its population size is close to India at 1.3-1.5 billion, some countries have more registered professional athletes of certain sports despite having much smaller population than China and India. 

It comes down to the sport culture of a country, I'm guessing there are fewer registered athletes in India than Netherlands even, also check out the availability of sport facilities in India compared to other countries, I think it is also pretty low. 

Indians are not genetically inferior but I think religion is a great factor when it comes to nutrition, there are so many food taboos around in India that are stopping ordinary Indians from having balanced diet. This topic was discussed just yesterday. [This](http://mba.tuck.dartmouth.edu/pages/faculty/andrew.bernard/olymp60restat_finaljournalversion.pdf) famous paper found a strong association between Olympics medal tally and GDP, population size, ""host country effect"" and ""Olympics-oriented investment"" like in Soviet Union and China. China's advantage over India is its strong economy (5 times India's GDP) and an obsessive investment in sports. Apart from the many reasons listed already it's also about the cultural apathy towards any sport which we do not already dominate in. That apathy translates to exceptional athletes with medals practically begging for food after retirement. Govt does not provide enough after care to retired athletes and they are left to fend for themselves.

Would you want your child to sacrifice education for say a chance at volleyball if you know that most players have no future after the fact? Cause Indians don‚Äôt give a fuck about anything except cricket. Kyuki pesa lgta hai Like in real life democratic political system and govt has utterly failed to provide infrastructure for sports , promote it and provide facilities and support athletes . Its a combination of genetics, culture and GDP. In all these factors, India has the worst possible state.

1. Genetics: Indians on average are shorter and fatter than all races (maybe except East Asians). There is a study which shows that for the same BMI, Indians add on more fat than any other race. Needless to say, absorbing more fat for the same BMI is not a recipe for athleticism. 

2. Culture: The diet is horrible. Full of carbs (processed nowadays) and almost no protein. Nothing to do with income either, rich people also have the bad mix of macro nutrients. No culture of physical fitness. People think going to gym is only for bodybuilders.

3. GDP: $2000 per capita is 142 out of 200 countries. India is piss poor. Dont consider PPP here, top class sports equipment doesnt cost less in India. Small schools in the US have better facilities than elite sports clubs in India.

4. Olympics: Consider the types of competitions in Olympics. I would understand if there was 1 swimming event. Instead there are dozens of different combinations of swimming related events. This excludes most poor countries where swimming pools are a luxury. Equestrian events - need I explain?",2019-07-21 19:51:35

Sports,Why Hotstar Premium sucks. [np],182,br9cdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/br9cdx/why_hotstar_premium_sucks_np/,112,"1\. *They only do good quality 1080p for Game of Thrones.*

Literally every other show, movie and documentary (with very few exceptions) has a 1080p bitrate of less than 6Mbps. Game of Thrones, meanwhile, is at 9.2Mbps, which is almost twice as heavy in terms of bitrate than other HBO titles. Even Chernobyl, a lot of which happens in the dark, has a bitrate of 5.7Mbps.

Now, 4‚Äì6Mbps isn't necessarily a bad 1080p bitrate, especially if you are a service like Netflix that knows exactly how to encode video with that kind of a limitation.

But Hotstar is no Netflix, and their encoding is not very good. 

2\. *Content is censored and/or mutilated*

Iron Man 2 is censored (and I'm not just talking about the bleeps in the Senate hearing). Like, Star World on TV level censored. Oh, and it suffers from the low-ass bitrate too. 

3\. *Omnipresent logo on top right*

Why the hell does Hotstar think it is important enough to interrupt my viewing experience with their intrusive-ass logo? What does this achieve? Their DRM is already super-annoyingly world-class (probably thanks to third party firms paid off by HBO and the like). 

And if you watch a livestream, like GoT or IPL, you are forced to see both this logo as well as the Hotstar icon on the bottom right. 

4\. *Not accessible*

Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has closed captioning. Fuck deaf people. Not a single one of Hotstar's titles has an audio description track, even if one exists for the title (eg. Hollywood/HBO). To be fair, this shortcoming applies to every Indian streaming service. Which makes no sense, since we have the second population of people with sensory impairments. 

5\. *DRM-ed to the balls*

New device? Sorry, you're requesting multiple streams at the same time. Android phone? Sorry, we cannot show you 1080p video. VPN? Don't even go there. 

6\. *All of this was preventable*

Video quality? Just have more versions of titles at a higher bitrate for people with good internet. Logo? It's not burned into the video, so just take it off. Inaccessible? Just ask rightsholders to also send subtitle files and audio description files. Make DRM just as unintrusive as other streaming services that do business with the exact same group of companies you do. Censoring? Don't fucking do it. As simple as that. Two or three jobless lawsuits are nothing for The Mouse to handle.",shadowbannedguy1," That watermarked horrible logo along with poor bitrates on videos are the top most reasons I mostly pirate the shows I watch that's on hotstar exclusively, despite being a premium subscriber. You would be better off with HBO GO and a decent VPN. You forgot to mention if you want to skip to the next episode, you have to go through the closing credits and then the screen will change. Then you have to play the episode, select subtitles and then again fast forward the opening credits. Downloaded episodes on phone expire in a day. Shitty user interface. Netflix cost 600/month. Hotstar has PL for 999/year. 

Cheap> Quality. Especially for people like me who has hardly any time to watch anything. And you forgot about the search engine of hotstar. It's literally terrible. Also no 5.1 surround sound support. Yes but for ‚Çπ999/year I won‚Äôt complain I am yet to create an account and subscribe myself onto any of the streaming services and thus, I don't have an idea about the quality and content of each streaming services but, we won't be having Disney + here right?

As in most (if not all) those Disney + shows will be hosted by Hotstar here in India? Also, Hotstar is the one that has the entire MCU library, if I'm not mistaken? For 999/year includes IPL and English Premier League. It is a STEAL for sports fans.. To think I paid ‚Çπ999 for this garbage of a season You left out the shitty user interface. Long live psarips.net I am watching Chernobyl and the quality is utter shit. Can't believe I am paying for this shit. It sucks. I saw Chernobyl ep03 tonight and despite choosing 'high' quality, the video was worse than what Netflix data-saver option would be. I mean I'm happy to pay more to have the kind of viewing experience that Chernobyl can offer but Hotstar kills it.

Also, shit goes down way too often on the Hotstar app on my TV. Log in Hotstar - 'sorry something went wrong' error Wait till the content on HS get regulated/censored. 

Premium subscriptions for HS will soon die and they will be clueless , just like they are now. They got subtitles mate. Ah, thank you for reminding. Cancelling my subscription right now üòÖ. GOT over , Game over lol . I tried Hotstar Premium when there was some cash back offer and then promptly canceled it. I reached out to [hello@hotstar.com](mailto:hello@hotstar.com) on some of the points mentioned in this post with suggestions and feedback, but just got some boilerplate reply. I refuse to pay for this kind of service. Cheaper pricing isn't enough if the experience is terrible. In comparison, Netflix is several years ahead. The Hotstar product managers seem to be inept, and tend to think like they're just re-doing cable TV over the web. üôÑ You shouldn't bother with streaming services anymore if you can help it. Sooner or later, they will end up being censored to confirm to our ""Indian standards"" and most media on them will be ruined.

I don‚Äôt think they will ever improve the service, specially with the condescending attitude that they have.

Sports,"Arthi Arun, Asian Powerlifting Championship gold medallist: I haven't received any kind of support from any Sports Authority. I have submitted a letter but did not receive any reply. All I am asking is for an appreciation letter. Is that too much to ask? (12.06.2019)",344,bzxhow,https://twitter.com/ANI/status/1138897248564142080?s=19,22,,FactCheckPolice," _Continued Tweet...._

>Arthi Arun: I'm waiting for sponsors, till now no one approached me. I don't know why people ask me 'You're a doctor why do you need a sponsor?' Do you ask that to a cricketer? Sportspersons should be encouraged by giving sponsors so they concentrate on game&not financial burden. All the sports in India other than cricket deal with this because neither they are televised nor they are reported enough. Sponsorship depends upon popularity of sport which is very rare for weightlifting. You know every player's name of a cricket team but not the same with archery or any other sport. And to be real Sports Authority of India suck's the biggest! Well the sports authorities are busy attending the cricket World Cup so rest all sorts can wait. When participating in international events, is it possible to represent a neutral faction/body, instead of your own country? Because if the country doesn't care or appreciate efforts towards it, then sportspersons are better off representing something else. If it's not cricket then India doesn't care, it's sad but true. For a nation of over 1 billion people we should, purely statistically speaking, have way way more Olympians and medals.

Sports,Cricket Corruption | Patriot Act with Hasan Minhaj | Netflix,128,bth74c,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM,56,,teslaluvrs," I think  the 2008 Harbahajan Singh - Symonds episode should have been handled more maturely . It was more nuanced than that . Sadly Hasan Took the easy way out and decried it as racism. Man that interview with Lalit Modi ( another Modi ha ha ) was funny af The episode is fine. But tbh he doesn't stress enough on the fact that why BCCI  does what it does. India being the most populous cricket playing nation, generates the most revenue. Naturally it would want the major chunk of it so that it could be used to distribute to the state cricket boards. This would only help in improving the facilities in the country. It might not be the most morally right thing to do but it also is not that wrong. It is a classic capitalist move. This is classic american mentality when they bully instituations for thier countries bennifits..its justified.. 

But when others do it it's curruption...

BCCI bully ICC becuase we supply major chunk of thier revenue. India gives cricketers arround the world opportunity and money. So ya BCCI have every right to be selfish and use thier leverage. BCCI use that money to improve stadiums and give more opportunities to young players.

I am not going to deny that BCCI doesn't have internal corruption but its no where near the level of past.. and after all the scandals in recent past BCCI has realised that its in thier best interest to stay out of politics... so i see no reason to be angry towards BCCI now. Just another recent case.. Australia and England were allowed to withdraw their players from the IPL for world cup prep. South Africa also wanted to do the same, but India blackmailed them with the cancelation of a tour after world cup. The big three at work again!

Ps. This is only a rumour and very few articles came out. But Ottis Gibson (coach of RSA) publicly said ""It would have been great had our players came back earlier"" and there were commentators who were talking about it at times too. But yeah, it is totally plausible. Does anyone else find him annoying? Ah yeah let me comment on others house made of glass while I sit in my comfort zone inside a well built fenced house.
I will only identify myself as an Indian while playing the victim card. 
Just sayin. I stopped watching IPL a few years ago as it became too many matches for me to care. Glad I did. Even FIFA is more interesting with all their scandals as it happens once every few years instead of every year! Is it bad that I feel proud when he says ""BCCI made ICC it's bitch."" If BCCI is bringing in this amount of Insane money where is it actually going? I am the only one who is seeing the symbolism in his hoodie choice for the episode. [removed]",2019-05-27 17:10:00
Sports,"How a French sports gear retailer is making Adidas, Nike, and Puma sweat in India",447,bk52zi,https://qz.com/india/1610385/decathlon-showrooms-give-nike-puma-adidas-the-jitters-in-india/,101,,thelielmao," Decathlon is one of my favorite shops/showrooms/warehouse.

It's like the Ikea of sportswear/clothing. Decathlon near my home organise events, from small walks for a cause to random cycling. Though a small town, it often has active participation of locals. 

Also, their staff are directly involved in these training activites, kinda makes the whole experience great. More than a shop, it gives a socialising platform in sports field. Thank you Decathlon, for once you are making arrogant sportswear makers like Nike, Adidas, Puma, Asics, NB nervous.  These people have made their products like 50 -100 % more expensive in India as compared to the west.  Largely making common products out of reach for the middle class.  

Nike shoes which are just common wear in the west is overpriced here and is supposed to be a fashion statement. So much so that when NRI travel to India they bring shoes as gifts to please my family. 

For context: A 100 $ Asics running shoe is  Rs14000 in India. What kind of business model is this? I'm going to decathlon for sure TIL Decathlon is French [deleted] Decalathon replaced my 4 month old shoes under warranty. :) 

Fuk u Adidas I don't know of anyone's been to decathlon's in Bangalore but somehow in all of them, the helper staff seem like well off upper middle class people in their 20s, you can tell from the way they speak and dress, their English is like those South Bombay kids. I have even seen foreigners work as staff. This is very weird because you don't see people who are well off doing jobs that are considered menial by a lot of people. Does decathlon pay really well or something. Reduced visits to Decathlon, because I end up spending more than I need to. The assortment is so good and the quality is first class. I just live their shop man so big and they let you try and play with things. Even the employees at store are so friendly and helpful. I wish more brands adopt this style, I'm hopping IKEA has similar experience. 

The store in thane had very friendly environment, they trusted customers and I've seen so many times people shoplifting so they had to start tagging and deploying security at stores. That's just sad. 

These Adidas, Nike, puma deserve this. Decathlon cares about sports more than money-making... I fucking love Decathlon. Amazing quality stuff at great prices. I just wish they make a shopping app. Or at least do something w their website. It's really buggy or something Decathlon, The Hamley's for Adults What's the difference between their dry, dry+ and dry+ breathe running t shirts? I heard great things about them from my buddies (so their word of mouth advertising seems to be working well) - will have to visit one day. it is pronounced ""di-ka-thlo"" if anyone is interested I just love Decathlon for their product quality and excellent pricing. It's my go to shop for shoes clothes and basic sport goods. 

I have met many disabled employees at the Pune store (and I'm sure they proactively encourage and hire) which really improves their brand image in front of me. Most of their staff is super young so kudos to them for employing out country's young guns. 

Their staff is excellently trained and helps you get the best item possible. Kids cycling and playing in store brings a smile to my face. 

If anyone from Decathlon is reading this - Thank you for coming to India! :) I love my decathlon. You can get some nice quality stuff for cheap. the store design is one of the best aspect of them. Explore all you want and buy what you like no interference from staff unless you need it This is really popular in hyderabad This is the place where I end up buying shit I don't need. Nike, Adidas, Puma etc. are expensive just because they want to recover their huge investments in marketing Do they happen to sell them online?? I'm hearing about this brand for the first time üòÖ Decathlon is my prefferd showroom to buy shoes, pant & physical fitness related things This should be an obvious middle finger in the faces of Nike and other over expensive brands. Decathlon stuff is amazing value for money. Somewhere I read this ""Decathlon is Hamleys for adults"" Shower thought: Decathlon is basically Hamleys for adults. I love everything about them but hate their trail rooms. Everything is perfect there but why they have coffin like squeezy trail rooms? Mostly i have seen people who are into sport there 5:10-6 ft easily, i wonder how they manage in their. I am 5:9 and i find it really difficult to especially for bottom wears. I love Decathlon.
I also only buy running/cross-training shoes (or such critical gear) only from nike(or high quality brands).
It may make little to no difference where your shorts or t-shirts are from, but if you're an active runner/player it's important to invest in the right pair of shoes or equipment.
Sure Decathlon is amazingly affordable, while nike is exorbitantly overpriced, but there are clear and significant reasons to also get nike.
Foot calluses or even alignment and stride, or injuries are difficult to avoid if you're hitting the pavement or the treadmill for 10km 3 times a week. If you can reduce probability by even 10%, the high price is worth it. After they opened in Chennai I stopped bothering with the other brands, much more affordable imo.

Sports,Your thoughts on e-sports,51,bwkqxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/bwkqxu/your_thoughts_on_esports/,48,"I recently saw a video where the Danish PM visited the largest e-sports training arena and played Counter Strike Global Offensive (csgo) with their team.
E-sports has undeniably risen and still rising up to huge popularity levels

Yet , in India we see people suggesting that gaming is bad and games should be banned and it feels like our government has no idea that a huge platform like e-sports exists. 

Seeing that people wanted PUBG banned for not acknowledging their mistake or bad parenting also makes it look like majority of India is against e-sports.

What are your thoughts ?",SlapMak," The main reason that esports hasn't flourished in India yet is because most of the older generation and people of younger generation who don't play games are not educated about the potential of esports and it's success in other countries. Parents would feel embarrassed and would not acknowledge it as a real job.

Second reason is that we Indians don't spend a lot of money, especially on luxury goods, and good PCs are luxury. Hence parents don't feel like it's worth spending money on an industry that they have no idea about and something that could be very volatile.

If we want esports to grow in India, we need to educate people about it. It was difficult in America itself to accept esports as a profession.

I listened to a really good podcast episode between The Esports Observer and Akshat Rathee from NODWIN Gaming where Akshat explains the esports scene in India and also explains why people cheat. It's a must listen for people interested in the esports scene in India. 

Here's the link: https://open.spotify.com/episode/28MfL8Mf8tlwIqvqnUPM15?si=FRP1PciSTuCXZaqJOm4BWQ Will only get bigger. It's inevitable. Danish PM playing with Astralis (considered best CSGO team ever) was just a PR move around their election time. That being said, a number of top-tier talents come from Nordic and Scandinavian region.

That being said, a career in esports is still not viable even outside, let alone here. If you're not a talent in a top org, bills become hard to pay. There have been many instances where talented people/ teams had to raise funds from the community itself. I don't know about other games, but Indian CSGO ""pros"" don't have the talent like the EU players. They are just way better. EU just owns.

Also to make big bucks, we ll have to invest time and money. Especially Esports. Also doing it unless you are absolutely sure? Investing thousands of hours practicing? Do you think the ""society"" will accept it? They ll just brand the guy ""addicted to gaming, gaming is bad, it should be banned"". Crosspost to r/indiangaming as well We need a break out star in a competitive game(like faker or sumail) so we can kick start more poeple in our country. We have teams but they are just so far behind international standards... But hopeful since we have so many tournaments now than compared to last decade... In my local area, a lot of gaming pubs host DOTA and CSGO tournaments.

But I believe it's gonna be a long while before esports becomes recognised over here. Unless people take gaming seriously nothing's gonna happen. Half of my friends didn't knew PUBG was a thing unless it hit the play store. I feel pathetic for people calling themselves gamers who play on mobile and despise PC gaming. ( My friends tease me for playing games on PC saying I have no life and shit and yet they play PUBG the whole day. )

Esports won't be a thing unless someone is ready to take flak head on from the Indian society. Our aunties and unkills who believe in doctor and engineer species only. I hope someone revives it.

In the few years I've seen some really great Indian born games on mobile gaming platform. They're not 10/10 but at least they're of the same quality we deserve compared to the western counterpart.

Recently our college was creating clubs. I wanted to make an Esports club badly but I realized 90% of my colleagues wouldn't know its meaning. The idea got buried. Even if I did manage to get the courage and tell my faculties I want an Esports club and explain them, I m pretty sure they'd laugh their ass off and forget about it next day. The general rat culture in our country does not provide a conducive environment for competitive games like Dota/CSGO to flourish.

We might have more players than Europe but the skill level is terrible I don't thing pubg mobile is going anywhere when it comes to esports. It's not precise enough cause touch screen for an event involving skill Give it another 10 years and it will become an Olympic Sport. First of all, let [Redeye talk some sense into you. It's esports.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO8IaV_DAoY) 

I'm a fellow competitive csgo follower (RIP Astralis era btw). Majority of India has no concept of esports. I think we need to convince a certain influential Gujarati man to educate our masses about esports, because I see no other way of esports growth in India. Not in the near future at least. People don't considered gaming/streaming an occupation here. I bet most of the people don't know about joining esport orgs For e sports to be a thing people must buy the damn games.Excluding cheap and free games like CS,Dota,TF2 etc which game has a large enough player base to even ask this question? pc parts cost 2x more in India and people don't think its good investment. The reason why esports haven't taken off in India is that we don't have any fallback options. There are no social safety net and any breaks taken during education is extremely frowned upon by Indian society and in extent Indian firms. Let's say, you try your hands on esports, you play well but not good enough to make a living out of it. Then you need to get a job and that's only backed up by education. No firm will hire you if you put esports in your cv. Not to mention if you take a break in your studies to pursue esports, there's a good chance your cv will be thrown into the dustbin even before it reaches the interviewer.

The same is applicable for other type of sports. Football is very popular in West Bengal, but most players are struggling hard to make ends meet. If you've watched Dangal then you'd know what happens to Amir in the movie is a reflection of what happens to our society in general. The only two ways to make an honest living in India is either through education or through business. Esports won't help you in either in the long run. Don't you remember the PM referencing pubg? I feel that e-sports is pernicious for the society in general. It promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. Playing video-games for long enough to become the best at them ought to have a deleterious effect on one's health, both physical and mental. Even though I love playing video games, Sports for me is still something physical. Sports? Are they still calling them sports to make them feel and sound more legit? Lol",2019-06-04 18:21:09
Sports,Request Dhoni to remove Army insignia from gloves: ICC to BCCI,76,bxiedb,https://m.timesofindia.com/sports/cricket/icc-world-cup/request-dhoni-to-remove-army-insignia-from-gloves-icc-to-bcci/amp_articleshow/69678580.cms,33,,buzzenwired," I don't see anything wrong with wearing gloves. Dude is an honorary army man, supports the army... What's wrong with that? It's just gloves. Trivial bullshit is trivial. I don't mind them asking Dhoni to remove the insignia as long as they don't entertain any other political gestures from anyone else. But the problem is far too many have gotten away with it. Enforce the rule strictly and consistently. Otherwise, their request carries no weight. How does it hurt ? Wtf ? Tributes are done everywhere , I get rules are rules. 
How does cosmetic change affect the game ? 

Can somebody enlighten me ? Yeah they have a point. Dhoni should instead go at the border and fight instead of playing sports if he can't part with indian armies even while playing. Good. request ? he should be fined. whats with request ? if he violated the rules..he should be fined. Social Media is making this matter more highlighted. There are some rules & regulations of ICC which should be followed by the cricket playing nations.

Both BCCI & ICC can make the decision by going a step back. Isko bhi PTSD de bhagwan. Aur gloves pahene se nhi hoga.",2019-06-07 05:30:20

Sports,Is cricket really that popular outside India?,13,c55wl5,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/c55wl5/is_cricket_really_that_popular_outside_india/,16,"I mean, the main issue I see with ODI cricket its just a big test of patience at times. Unlike any huge game, like soccer, rugby, baseball, hockey, etc. Cricket is just too too long.   
   
I loved ODIs during my childhood but nowadays I just can't help but say that IPL is infinitely more exciting than ODIs.    
  
Is cricket locally as popular in any other country? Except India or the subcontinent? I mean there are teams from plenty countries, but is cricket actually popular in the streets or base level there?",mylackey," TLDR - No. 

Real answer - ICC isn‚Äôt really interesting in growing the game unless it can find $$$ there, which is why it‚Äôll try to grow the game in the US but do jack shit for UAE despite being HQ‚Äôd in it ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I've been wondering the same thing. Currently in the US and there are a lot of British expats at work and none seem to be following cricket. I'm beginning to think that ever since the 2010s after India won the world cup, the game has become ""more South Asian"" for lack of a better phrase. Growing up in the 90s, it wasn't like this. British and Aussie cricketers were not just sports stars but we're also page 3 personalities. I don't think it is like that anymore. Does anyone remember Shane Warne and Liz Hurley? I believe there is a change in the demographic. As someone else mentioned in this thread, the Brits at work are actually more interested in the Women's soccer world cup than icc. I guess the grapes are sour? I would say outside the subcontinent cricket is a very 'niche' sport - it does have followers and some kids playing it, but not really big among the general pubic. Who gives a shit . Americans themselves don‚Äôt bother if their sports are popular elsewhere neither should we . Sub continent where a quarter of the world population follows it generates decent revenues for the ICC. Australia has proper cricket fans who aren't seasonal followers of the game #No I can tell that in the nordic regions, Cricket is pretty much a niche sport. There are a few clubs who play cricket but thats about it, the general public do not care about it. In the UK more people are following the Women's World Cup (soccer) than they are the cricket world cup.  Wimbeldon has started and so the CCWC is probably down to number 3 in terms of viewing figures.  In terms of general interest...it's niche. Nope, even Australia and England has stopped caring for it that much. Its become a niche sport outside of India.

And i believe the BCCI and ICC are responsible for it. Hasan Minhaj summaries it quite well in his [video]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5DWJv1hiwM)",2019-06-25 23:11:06

I‚Äôve read his book, but I want to hear some personal accounts and experiences. How could the everyday Indian feel the impact of this event - if any? Was it celebrated nationwide? How did it impact the culture? Did anything change? How significant was this day in 2008 - and the man?

&#x200B;

Any and all comments are welcome! Thank you!!",nellerhk," Nothing changed for other sports, shooting is for the elite and well connected. The laws in India prevent any common man in India to get into shooting. For example the purchase of an airgun requires you to be first a member of a shooting club, these clubs don't entertain applications unless you know someone or bribe them to give you membership, these people are fucking corrupt as hell and will treat you like a piece of shit unless you are well connected.  Purchase of a fire arm is next to impossible for the common man. They will never give you a firearm license if you say you want it for sport. Majority of the indian shooters come from law-enforcement and military community. 

This sport is for the upper elite, there is no grassroot sport shooting revolution, may be there are more rich shooters now. I think the Olympic gold did capture public attention. Coupled with India hosting Commonwealth games just after it, and doing well there, there has been more attention to Olympic sports. Of course, the attention isn't very detailed and sports ministry still lacks significant accountability mechanisms, but I feel there is more interest in Olympic sport athletes.

My mechanical professor misbehaved with a cute northie. Suspended.

Another mechanical professor (also hostel warden) tortured hostel students, he shit his pants when one student drank all-out mosquito repellant. He liked students who are scared easily and act like slaves. He had some kind of joy feeling powerful over these helpless kids who came to unknown city and stayed in that hostel.

My school math teacher was a hardcore christian, she gave special care to christian students. A non-christian student not scoring is dumb, but a christian student not scoring needed practice. 

Tuition teacher prefers talkative and jovial ones, he was a strict math teacher in KV but jovial and friendly guy in his tuition classes. He even teaches shortcuts and easy methods in tuition but not in school.

PT teacher was hell bent on sports and never let other teachers take PT period as substitute for their subjects. We all loved her. She liked the ones who got her medals in zonals.

My computer teacher liked the ones who are smart and answers questions first..Imagine students like Hermione from harry potter. 

Biology teacher was the best who genuinely worried about underperforming students. Never gave special attention to top students as they never needed it in first place


To answer your question, i think this is all subjective. i think it all comes down to have a student behaves with a teacher cuz even they are human and then comes all the other factors like academic performance etx [deleted] Kids who interact in class - not the ones who stare into the abyss like brain-dead zombies. Kids who question, challenge and provide alternative to what I teach. Kids who are cool and talk wittily - not the ""yes, sir"" kind of flattering dorks. I like if they are involved in extra-curricular activities, but it should not be at the cost of their primary goal - education.

P.S.: I am an Assistant Professor (Engineering) in a top government college. I teach online and one on one which makes for a very different experience than classroom teaching - the most inspiring ones are those who never give up. They may be less gifted, and scores may disappoint. But they tenaciously keep working and in the end their results have always surprised me.

Just last year one student who i taught over two years and despaired for his performance made it through to NIT Surathkal.

Another guy who I briefly taught in 10th, was pretty ordinary, but made up for that with insane amounts of work and got into IIT-B. There he stepped it up sleeping only 4 hours a day on occasion and won the Presidents Gold Medal. When he graduated, Stanford and MIT rolled out red carpets to welcome him to their campus.

I could go on, but these two really stood out. Not a full time teacher; help a few kids in my neighborhood with their studies. I try to get them to stay inquisitive, ask questions & accept it is alright to say ""I don't know"". School education discourages then from asking questions (especially if it falls outside their syllabus). [removed] Toppers Dead I like the ones who are curious about things.

Doesn't matter which subject music/sport/science/business/cooking/art whatever. They go and try to find the answers and come back with many questions. Watching that process, of them discovering things for the first time by their own effort is very inspiring and satisfying. IANAT but other half is. 

Recently she was most impressed by a student who was deported from another school after failing, came here, continued to do poorly upto preparatory exams but got things together, concentrated and worked hard and ended up in high sixties (%). Approaching the exams she used to say I will be most happy if this kid passes. And was ecstatic to see his scores finally. There were many kids in 90+ and 80+ range in the same batch.

Sports,"Thank you, MSD. The great Indian captain, the greater life coach.",7,cbtecp,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/cbtecp/thank_you_msd_the_great_indian_captain_the/,5,"Just trying to put some words for MS after last night defeat & surely his last meaningful ODI in the blue. A lot of what MS achieved & how it achieved transcends cricket & sports in general & that's why I think it's more suited to talk about here than r/cricket. He is the embodiment of the India that can reach to the top & while doing be utmost reverential to ones around, respectful of those who came before, and supportive of those coming after. 

MS is a transformational cricketer in every sense of the world. Just like you can demarcate India's economy with pre & post liberalization, you can actually demarcate Indian cricket pre & post Dhoni. Pre MSD, we were a good team that might win it all one day. We had couples of fairytale matches, the NatWest final, comes to mind that would cherish for ages, and we had some of world's best players. But we didn't use to win as much. We learned how to reach the finals, but we lacked the how to win it. 

Post MS, we became favourites in most tournaments we enter. Again, we don't win everything that's in front of us like those big bad Aussies but every time we don't, it feels like one off day. Not an structural problem. We might be having more of these now. But MS came, he changed us, and delivered a World Cup. Before than he delivered a T20 cup, and after as an encore delivered a Champions Trophy. He also won us the mace of the best test team. We just started winning more. We were not scared of losing the match in first five over anymore. We had our finisher. Now, it was the time for them to be scared of us.

It's a testament to his resolve that a boy with not-so-great technique reached here, and it's a celebration of India's cricket that a boy from Ranchi could reach here. No longer is Indian cricket in those urban metro pockets. No longer a kid in Mumbai is sure to be in the team more than that kid from some tier 2 / tier 3 town whose father is working in small public sector job. Now, they compete for same prize. I hope India gets a transformational player from North East too, and truly make Indian cricket ""Indian"" cricket.

MSD truly changed us. If you don't see, just look at all the other Asian team around us, they win because of their individual brilliance, but they not outperform their ceiling. We were once like them. Then we started being not like them. We became a unit that wins. And, there's no one to thank more than MSD for that. 

Thank you, skip, the pleasure was all ours. Farewell. If I want to learn one thing from you, it's the ability to take both wins & losses, both good & bad, in the same way, in the same stride. For both are just impostors in this battle called life anyway.",cfc19, Never forget the way he took advantage of his position to push in players from Rhiti Sports.

At least his sacrifices were not in vain and he will always live on in her heart! The headlines only made me emotional let alone watching the whole press conference.

May god bless her. Such a shame, to see Sports Min only advt. & Running virtually on Twitter. Even if they work 5% many aspiring athletes would put India on top on medal tally. Her hard work & her father's sacrifices did it all.

I have noticed many times that Virat is a famous yet hot-headed sportsperson. He has a big fan following, so he must play it cool and try not to make an angry face or super celebrating even something small. Dhoni is cool. He plays it cool. 
Idk why but I just don't like Virat for his this behaviour. I also don't know the truth about what he screams or cries in an ongoing match but it seems more like some abusive word or an insult for opposing team players. He is a great sportsman but he should realise the fact that he is role model for young and aspiring players.",koibhinhi," I don't think anyone rates him for his  personality, He is a brilliant cricketer with the typical mainstream Punjabi/Delhi attitude.  If it was not for his cricketing talent and hardwork, he would've been another Sreensanth. When did this become Unpopular? It‚Äôs a free country. He is as free to be himself as you are to dislike him. Why devote so much time to thinking about people who have no influence on your life whatsoever? I have gone from being a hater to absolutely adoring him (no homo). 

He earned all the respect through unbelievable consistency, performing everywhere in the world and conquering all challenges posed to him. Kohli is probably not as gifted as Sachin BUT he more than makes up for that through elite level of fitness that allows him to run doubles after scoring a hundred at same speed when he came on the crease. 

He plays cricket for India and is bloody good at it, that's all that matters. If you want to hear his side of the story then watch Nat Geo Masterclass episode on him.

Edit: No doubt he's bit of an asshole. He's a sports person and every sports person has their own style. You can see that in different sports as well. See Ronaldo, Djokovic they have so much anger on the field because that helps them. So what's wrong? 
He's not the most talented cricketer like Rohit Sharma, but he's the best cricketer in the world right now due to his hard work and  determination and dedication to fitness.
( I met Virat once off the field, he's a really kind person and gentleman. ) I don't care about his personality. He's a great player. Rohit sharma is a gifted and telented batsman.However , Virat kohli is Hardworking batsman and if history has proven one thing that is hardwork beats talents. If you see earlier records(under nineteenth even couple of years after) compare Rohit sharma and virat kohli you will find that sharma was little ahead and cricket came naturally to him.However Virat kohli is diciplined ,hardworker and he did not had butter chicken in last 4 years(heard in an interview) compare love handles of rohit sharma.Nothing against rohit sharma, Scoring 264 in an international is nothing sort of a miracle. But virat kohli is different he has picked his sacrifices ,He is impatience but compensate with perseverance. He is constantly trying improve not only his game but also in other life aspects.Whenever he is on Buses he make sure that he reads self improvement book.I am not fan of virat kohli but i am fan of his dicipline and regime. Aggression is absolutely necessary in competitive sports. Cricket in particular. 

Some manifest that aggression through shrewd tactics, some do it in body language, and some really talented ones do both. Whats up with everyone hating his aggression on the field?

Just because Dhoni was cool, not everyone can be like him

If you are expecting everyone to be nice to everyone then you must living in an another dimension I don't understand the folks here. First you guys cry about the 'Log Kya kahenge' attitude of parents. And when someone doesn't give a damn about it, you turn back and say ' Hooo, you're a role-model, act like it'. Why TF should he care what people & kids think about him? Sexy cricketer though, his batting is poetry in motion. Doesn't hurt that the helmet means I don't have to look at his face. He has matured after marriage. Might be a bit cocky, but sportsmen ka chalta hai. https://youtu.be/Gc_spTXnXRs Watch this: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc\_spTXnXRs&feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_spTXnXRs&feature=youtu.be)

>Sometimes, before an Australia series, Virat says the most outrageous things. I read it in the newspaper and cringe. But then, I feel that he wants that tough contest, and wants that lip on the field, because it gets the best out of him.

>You can‚Äôt blame him, because it works so very well for him. But that may not be everyone‚Äôs cup of tea. Ajinkya Rahane, for example, is very different.  
>  
>What worries me is that a lot of young kids tend to copy Virat, without realising that they are not being authentic to who they really are. Guys, there is a term called sportsmanship. It means playing competitively and yet respecting the game and the opponent players. You just cant go bad mouthing and showing frustation every time you get a chance. Thatbis just bad faith. First Kohli seemed to do this coz of his immense passion, these days it seems like he just fcuking hates his opponents. No matter how good you are, when you play at the level he is, you habe the resposibility of maintaining a decorum. See tennis for reference. I'm glad others in this world who care about cricket see Kohli's abuse-filled aggression as a passion for the game. No doubt he's one of the best in the world out there, but if the same abuse that he spews on-field if done on the street he could face criminal charges for abusive behaviour. Sadly commentators misinterpret as the passion so does the media, and budding cricketers and youth use the same in their field of work too. [deleted] Slightly late to the party but anywho - 

VK is definitely not overrated. Over the years, he has changed from a brash, immature gaali-spewing young boy to a calmer, more mature man. This was evident by the way he has carried himself in the public eye, most remarkably when he defended his then-girlfriend (and now wife) Anushka Sharma when she was getting trolled by his supporters. It is important to note that he started his career at an early age and since then, he has been under scrutiny. All of us were dumb as teenagers, just that our antics were not scrutinized by the media. 

If anything, Virat Kohli should be a role model for all young boys. He lost his father when he was barely in his teens, went to play a match while grieving his death, led his team to victory, made the team, became the best damn player that India has seen in a long time and is now leading the team to victory in the CWC. That too, without any connections or influence - purely on the basis of his talent and hard work. He also seems to be popular with his team and has their respect and support. He is a supportive husband who is not afraid to show his love for his wife and to stand up for her. His aggression is a part of his game and it is what makes him, him. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a valid reason to hate on him, given that the aggression has never transformed into anger issues giving way to physical violence. 

He is a shining example of how your talent and hard work can take you to dizzying heights. As far as pure skill and temperament goes he is in his own league. He is better than sachin. I don't think He's overrated.  He deserves to run his mouth and act like douche all he wants if he can back it up. You don't have to love his personality, just his cricket. 

Makes it all the more fun and satisfying to watch him be cocky and then get outplayed and humbled by the other team every once in a while. I loved old virat... exactly for his hot headed behavior.

In this country woth all our bullshit like repect elder, respect the tradition, act mature bla bla bla he was such a nice change..

He used to have ""fuck you i have skills back up my attitude"" mentality which was so fucking inspirational. India needed young energy like him which showed that skill and hard work are the most important not sucking to people above you.

Now he has matured though which is also good.

In a healthy society hard working successful people should be  celebrated and respected..virat is beast when it comes to hardwork He is a great player which is what matters I'm a big big Kohli fan. 

He's a run machine. Probably the best white ball batsman ever. Never ever seen someone so consistent as him. The only thing that keeps him going is his ferocious intensity. On field he might be a nightmare for opposition, but off the field, he does come across as a very cool guy. Have seen almost all of his interviews and found none where he acted as a dick. 

Everyone has their own strengths that gets the best of out them. Dhoni's calmness maybe, but for Virat, it's his agression and intensity. 

As Harsha Bhogle said it, you take intensity out of Kohli, there's no Kohli left. 

Btw, Dhoni isn't cool/calm. Raina had pointed it out during one interview that Dhoni frequently gives a stick (which is not wrong). Abused Manish on camera ( again, nothing wrong) and latest where he came on field to confront the umpire for the no-ball call. I realized it a long time ago, before he was crowned a legendary status. You woke up pretty late. I have never seen a biggest snob in the sports before Kohli. Overrated? No motherfucker he's not. You'll understand when you start watching cricket. I don't know why Indian fans are so obsessed with behaviour. A cousin who lives in Australia told me how many fans he has there. FFS, understand the sport. You'll know he's already a legend. And he's better than Dhoni. Idk why Dhoni has more fans than Sachin and Dravid. Dhoni can't perform outside India. He's overrated. Yeah, I know this comment will be downvoted to oblivion. No shit. People are generally pretty obnoxious when it comes to Hero worship, and the cricket fans take it to the next level. I support this opinion. He is absolutely loved by media
 No questions are asked about his captaincy, decisions,...etc. just let off.. >he is role model for young and aspiring players.

Sports,Madhya Pradesh: Teenager dies after playing PUBG game on cellphone for six hours,23,bv6u6l,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/madhya-pradesh-teenager-dies-after-playing-pubg-game-on-cellphone-for-six-hours-5758922/,12,,_Obliterator," TikTok and Pubg have indeed revolutionized the country. 

But the users have taken these platforms bit too far. >My son was so engrossed in PUBG game that he played it from Sunday evening to early hours of Monday. He slept for a few hours and after getting up had his breakfast and then played the game for six hours at a stretch.

If he was doing this for several days then it's a case of chronic sleep deprivation. Ok, firstly this is a click bait title, people have died while working out in a gym or playing outdoor sports due to cardiac arrest. PUBG has been added to the article to get clicks. [deleted]",2019-06-01 01:50:54

More power to her. I hope more more athletes and people in public sphere speak about it. More power to her!!

Let's just keep our fingers crossed that she doesn't get ostracized,given the 13th century mentality people have.
***
Just a general observation on the worldviews Indians have.
If you take a look at the article, you'll find some comments. The comment section is enlightening.

""Natural couples can procreate, but unnatural cannot..If unnatural is to become a norm, then we have to think seriously of bio-ethical issues arising therefrom..Better go the nature's way though we have got freedom, we can use it either way.""

""Shows a great decline in ethical and value understanding, forgetting what our ancestors (the great rishis) and developing a slavish western educated attitude(so-called modern)
Doom is near when we forget ours roots.""
***
This is a very very *healthy sign* that the times we are livin' in is 1319,not 2019.
As for the rishis,if this gentleman had the time to look into our scriptures,he would find the Ardhanarishwara form(which celebrates feminity). Countless other refutes could be provided.
It's high time,we step up the ante,and counter them. These kind of mentality would only cause our society to move towards an intellectual dark age. 
I'm simply surprised,that every divine pronouncement is taken support to voice his beliefs about ""unnaturality"" and the fact that ""it won't support procreation"".
Sir, we're already with a burden of overpopulation. If some people don't procreate (by virtue of nature), it's for better. More power to her. brave. respect to her God bless her, and may she get strength to win more medals for india Hope people to support her online, will do the same in real life too.

It's hard to be out in India, but those that are able to do it do such an important service to all the struggling young LGBT kids. I'm so proud of her! 

Speaking of Indian lesbians, I recently watched Ek Ladki Ko Dekha Toh Aisa Laga. I'll be honest, I've always disliked Sonam and Anil Kapoor for their acting. But the movie, was really touching. 

It helped a lot that Sonam didn't wear much makeup and it was not glamour-themed like most movies are. It helped to focus on the plotline which I think was VERY cute. 


PS: if anyone has seen the movie, can you tell me what the name ""Kuhu"" Means? It's an adorable name. Thanks Is anyone even reading that a 18 year old woman went into a relationship with a 14 year old kid? If this was a straight relationship, the lot of you would be running around with pitchforks and candles by now. Yeah nice. We gotta reason to burn her images. Yay Indians get to work. I wonder why....ahahah I didn't read the full stop after soulmate and thought she was in love with herself. Godspeed! It's a similar situation all over the world. No pro footballer will accept that he's gay ( while he's playing ). I mean, it's brave of her and everything. And I'm totally for it. But isn't she in a relationship with her cousin's daughter? Okay serious question.

Dutee Chand has been found to have high testosterone because of hyperandrogenism. She was even banned once by IAAF all though got reversed later. Does her high T has to do anything with her sexual orientation? Isn't she the same ahtelte who was suspended or something for not being a woman? Good for population control. Go girl ! Nobody cares!

Kids are made to play in soaring heat without any sunscreen, in full school uniform making them sick.

Instead of sports class every day, let them go home 1 hour early  and have their own play hour.
 Or organise an indoor games session Literally sports in Indian schools is a total joke. 

You are not allowed to touch equipments, javelin throw, table tennis, etc. are either rusted lying in a corner or being used only by popular kids. 

Only the popular kids who keep in touch with the sports teacher are only allowed for tournaments and stuff.

If you opt physical education in the 11th and 12th standards, then be prepared to fukin cram all the theory and just don't ask for any sort of practical.

But the schools should have proper infrastructure. That's 13 years late. Sports period everyday? Not against the idea but we used to have 2 sports period a week where we were just left like stray dogs out in the scorching heat feeling free to do whatever the fuck we wanted (as long as it was confined to the open ground). 
No proper sports outfit, no proper sports equipment, infrastructure, most importance, seriousness. 
Schools pretend to be caring about a student's physical development. Rather than increasing eve frequency, come up with a well designed plan and test it for a smaller frequency.  It seems like only my school had decent sports facilities, and I used to look forward to sports period since it was only once or twice a week.  Sports aka second lunch recess/bunk period for anyone who isn't interested in sports.

Or stand in the heat for an hour so that you get a heatstroke while not even playing sports because there is not enough equipment and you can't go in with the athletic people.

 That is awesome! I wish I excelled in any sport! My school was an anti sport school! Literally! We had one sports hour every alternate week. Can you believe it? When I think about it now, my childhood sucked. Damn.  Sadly only 1 year of school left for me  We dont get sports are the parents to a fat kid objected Bc, first introduce differential timings, like in summer school should start and end atleast an hour early.

I don't have stats but I would like to think more people got rid of their cable connection (including DBST services) and invested in an Internet connection for their TVs.
Makes a lot more sense after this TRAI thingy. Paid around 600 for a lot of channels. Now I only have like 15 paid channels along with free channels and paying 260 for it. I wish some sense prevails and TRAI brings back revised older tariff as even the pack with all my favorite channels set me back only around 400 and for the same now, I need to pay for 700!! WTF! They must limit the rate of broadcaster bouquet packs. e.g. the rate of HBO HD is 12Rs. While the Turner HD+ pack of HBO, Disney, WB is 12.50 Rs. So why would anyone choose just a single channel if they can get more channel at the same rate or slightly more? There must be a rule that the rate of a bouquet must not less than, say 70% of total of rates of channels. Then only broadcasters will be forced to keep the price per channel low. Tariffs need to go higher not lower, or get ready for longer ad breaks, ads even taking up screen space during regular programming, and even more substandard content.

>Screw you TRAI. ",_RandomRedditor," Hey I was paying less than 250 with most HD sports channels running on D2H, now I'm paying 300+ & no sports channels & other GEC channels cut in half!

Screw you TRAI^2 TRAI has always been a loser when it came to the public. They were not able to reduce the call drops. They totally screwed us during net neutrality until (due to immense public pressure) they decided to go with it. And now this. Its time TRAI is held accountable for its existence.  TRAI anticipates that channel prices will come down gradually.

But I'd say get a firestick , a decent broadband connection and subscription of those streaming apps. I switched and never lookd back to DTH.  I am an Indian who stays in bangalore who watches content from almost all the channels (kannada, tamil, telugu, hindi, english) and I have to pay almost around 800 ish if I want to have the same experience. So fuck me right TRAI. Real dick move by TRAI This pricing scheme is helpful only for people who watched very few channels to begin with. TRAI had put a cap on discount that operators could provide in bouquets. 15% max discount on bouquet than a-la-carte. That would have gotten the price of individual channels down. All operators went to Madras High Court against this rule where HC ruled against TRAI. With much lower prices for bouquets than a-la-carte, operators are basically forcing you to take their bouquets instead of going alacarte way. [As of now, TRAI has withdrawn 15% discount cap petition from Supreme Court] Same here.

My yearly subscription will end soon. I have already subscribed to Sony Liv and Zee5. Will subscribe to Hotstar soon and too voot when they will have live channel available (they don't have subscription model as of today). It will cost me around INR 3000  per year. I have got 150gb broadband connection which is never utilized. So I'll be getting all the channels for 250 per month and since I have multiple TV, the average will be much less. I thank TRAI for screwing up this well. I think I was way too comfortable with what I had. They made me rethink the entire cabel cost optimization. Removed sony channels. Got Sony liv yearly subscription.   I used to pay 280 for all the channels, now I have to pay 600 for the channels which me and my parents watch. Go to hell TRAI.  Mine went from 280 to 200 [deleted] I used to pay 600ish monthly. Now it's half that. Thank you TRAI, I guess? Cost reduced for them who only watched Republic TV.. Mine went down from 300 to 275.

I watch only SD and don't have any hindi GECs. I think those channels are really expensive and pack costs have gone up for those watching hindi GECs.. for rest there is definitely a decline.

Also those who watch a limited number of channels have benefited while those who watch a large set have been fucked. TRAI are absolute dickheads.. We should also blame the government for letting this happen.  Tbh the problem isn't with TRAI , it's the nature of DTH and cable market which is against any good reform in the sector. By bumping up each channel rates to such an high price they say either toe the bouquet way or opt the alacarte model at your peril. 

I hope in coming days they reform the cost of Channels to the optimum cost. I'm on the other side of the coin. 

My monthly cost came down because I barely watch TV. I just picked the packs for channels my mom watches and I was done. I just add the sports channels on the days when there are matches I want to watch and remove them the next day.

 That's it. Ridiculous.  ""Your costs will be lower when you stop watching TV"" -- xoxo, TRAI I was paying 550 + 250 for a long duration pack. Now paying 300 + 250 (multi TV) Earlier you were probably being subsidised by those users watching fewer channels paying more than what they actually needed. Time to pay your fair share.

Looking at the pricing on TRAI [website](https://channel.trai.gov.in/), most of the channels cost ‚Çπ7 or less. Of those you mentioned, Sony, Sony sports channels and Colors cost ‚Çπ19 (and even these are available in bouquets to lower costs). I don't see how you can be mad at TRAI when they're instituting a per channel pricing and making it transparent. I don't understand how can anyone enjoy all the stupid bullshit they show on Indian tv. In recent years Indian influences have destroyed the only good channels worth watching like CN, NICK, DISCOVERY, NAT GEO, HISTORY etc.. Anyone intelligent in their right mind would cut the cable and use internet to watch anything entertaining. I had to keep the connection just for my parents and they too don't watch serials and all the vomit inducing reality shows. So this new system is pretty great for me. I just chose very few channels that we actually flip through. only 300 rs. 
 Try getting packs...I only watch sports (football) and I got a pack that was cheaper than selecting one by one, use the trai website to see cheapest plan I think those who watch more channels should be given some discount . I pay  250 for cable, and have almost channels.
Except some sports channels. Because they are expensive.
Now we will have to pay shit loads. Same here. I used to pay 400 for all HD and SD channels. Now I am getting only sony sports pack and star value pack.
I am actually shocked.
I am just waiting for Giga fiber and giga tv.  Exactly!

Had to forego the HD channels in order to get my prices lower than the previous package which had HD + SD. I have 4 tata sky connections. 1 primary and 3 multi tv(you have to pay full cost for primary and 250 each for multi tv). Out of the 4 TVs, 2 are HD supporting and other 2 are old school CRT. 

I was paying 750 for my primary and another 250+250+250 for my other connections. I had all HD & SD channels tata sky offers on its platform.

Now if I subscribe to a HD channel, I don't get its corresponding SD channel with it. So i can't watch HD channels now.

FUCK YOU TRAI I think these new DTH rules will benefit us in the long run.

As people start subscribing lesser number of channels, expect broadcasters to reduce their prices. Channels will lose a great deal of advertising revenue if they continue to price their channels so high.

My opinion - Wait and watch for a couple of months. Things will become clear.  Some people here and in other similar threads claim that hotstar and Sonyliv is a viable alternative. It's simply not for sports. I've a decent net plan (around 50mbps) and yet, when India plays, the quality is pathetic (Looks like 144p even when you select full HD) . It's alright while watching on your phone but you simply can't watch it on your TV.  Ftom 250 earlier to a steep 610 this month.

Fuck you TRAI and your ""Revolutionary"" step.  Iptv is your friend There are bouquet(bundled channels from company) eg-Times now hd bouquet at 15rs includes mn+,movies now,mnx,romedy now etc.
Choose the channels wisely ,for me it has reduced from 400 to 230rs. from my understanding, this whole exercise was to make dth expensive and complicated for the normal household. so that when jiofiber comes with all inclusive plan, customers would flock to it. and dth companies would disappear the same way most of the telecom companies have disappeared. in the end, only tata sky might survive along with airtel.  Do people actually still watch TV? Mine went from 420 a month to 320 I think Go for a google certified android box or you are in luck if you have android tv :) prefer online apps maybe one day they will come up with providing the option of the individual channel pay on IPTV :) Wait for JIO cable to come, it will be cheap then. Hey, let's not blame TRAI. They are really laying foundation for the future by forcing people to cut cabke/dth and move to online services. What an idea.

But IPL is being broadcasted on 8 out of 10 channels.

But they should have left atleast one more channel for other sports. What do you guys think?",kaduajinkya1," After the new TRAI regulations kicked in, people only have access to either SD or HD. Before these new rules i had every channel available on Tata sky whether it was SD or HD.

Star sports is the most incompetent broadcaster in the history of TV broadcasting. First of all their channel names are super wierd.

Star Sports 1

Star Sports 1 HD

Star Sports 2

Star Sports 2 HD

Star Sports 3

Star Sports 1 Hindi

Star Sports 1 Hindi HD

Star Sports Select 1

Star Sports Select 1 HD

Star Sports Select 2

Star Sports Select 2 HD

and a bunch of other channels specific to regional languages. They were telecasting IPL on every channel except Star Sports 3, Star Sports Select 2 and 2HD.

On Sundays even Star Gold(the movie channel) is also used for IPL telecasts.

TRAI fucked over the customer when they decided that when you subscribe to a HD channel you don't get its corresponding SD channel for free.  Star sports payed a boatload of money(something like 5k+ crores) to have the exclusive television rights . They will surely milk it as much as possible. They are a  Indian company therefore its expected that they will televise content specifically catering Indian audiences.
I am not surprised that they have only telecast IPL in 8 out of 10 channels. But is F1 being telecast or not? It only starts at 8.30 PM. Even Hungama Tv for kids cartoons are playing ipl. Are people don't give a fuck about it anymore that the network has to Force telecast on every channel which aren't supposed to. As an F1 fan. It sucks.  Lol, today I was switching every 5 minutes between Star Sports 1, Select 2 and Select 2HD. 

Today they telecasted like this:


So Star sports 2 - IPL

Select 2 HD - Formula1

Select 2 - Premier League (Liv vs Spurs)

But they didn't telecast qualifier yesterday, I'd to watch it on Hotstar. You can change the language from English to Hindi on the same channel. So don't even need the extra one for Hindi. Just an HD and SD is enough. Cut the cord and get hotstar.   Supply for demand",2019-04-01 02:43:20
Sports,Is it only me or many of you have lost interest in IPL?,68,b4m3qf,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b4m3qf/is_it_only_me_or_many_of_you_have_lost_interest/,56,"I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions and then my interest got reduced to the Semi Finals and the Finals in the later editions. 

Maybe, cricket fatigue is a thing. ",_RandomRedditor," Cricket fatigue is definitely a thing, especially if your favourite team performs bad year after year.

I stopped watching Cricket after the loss in 2015 WC and the ban of CSK in 2015. I remember being too bored and tired of it.

I started watching Cricket again from last year's IPL and found myself enjoying it again. Last year's IPL was amazing. Its made all the more fun by participating in the live threads on r/Cricket. i am in with you. IPL is too much hype and the teams dont give a shit I hope it doesn‚Äôt tire them out before the World Cup. All Indian team players should take it easy and use the matches as practice. I agree, idk wtf happened to rcb.  Like everything in life. Bro I stopped watching cricket after 12 std. Got too bored. You have grown older, now you shoulder more responsibilities. IPL has started already? I'm not kidding. I seriously wasn't aware.  Yep. I miss the olden days of cricket. It's hard to stay interested if a month-and-half(?) long event that happens every year. The players keep hopping teams. BCCI adds and removes teams as it pleases. Nothing about the format inspires loyalty towards any team. The whole tournament is designed to squeeze out maximum number of matches.

But in general I stopped caring about cricket a while ago so that's definitely the biggest reason.  I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. Not sport but manufactured entertainment. Slowly losing interest cause my team keeps losing.  Not just you. I only watched the first edition of IPL out of novelty. Then I used to fake interest in order to fit in. Now I don't care. >I followed the IPL for the first 3 editions. 

Same here. I lost interest after 2011.

It all started looking fake (for me) and all sugar coated stuff. Plus all the money that goes into it. My interest has actually grown more than ever. :) so many matches. I can't even recall the name of team now. yep for first 2-3 seasons was good. 

But too many matches. I have stopped watching test n one day also. 

Only 20-20 n all world cups. I lost interest in IPL 2 itself I've lost interest in cricket. I don't even recognize some players in our current national team.

IPL is one of the reasons I lost interest.

Just too much cricket.  Give it a time. Its just first match. Few interesting matches and you'll be discussing/checking score every minute.  Stopped watching cricket after the college. Stopped following after Dravid retired. I lost interest after major players moved to different teams, so this was several years ato. The team's didn't mean anything to me anymore. Lost interest.  same here bro   
not following from atleast 3 years I watched the motobhai team documentary (I have a daily data quota and I intend to use  it to the full). Pretty boring but I was in suspense since I didn't know the result and was pleasantly surprised when the team was booted before the knock-off stages started. 

I'm just tangentially aware but it seems like either Dhoni's or Chowkidar Gambhirs team wins every year. I think even the more avid fans will be giving it a miss this time. The World Cup is just around the corner for Gods sake! Who the eff gives a flying eff for T20s right now! dream11 will bring back that ""interest""? :P They already play 370 days a year and now this IPL , one series ends n they leave for another . I am really bored to be honest. I don't watch cricket, never did. No interest in cricket. Sitting in front of the TV was not an option in school days and college life was too hectic. After college finished there's no time for tv. I like fishing, it is what me and Dad did in free time back in the day.  People who gave up Cricket after their team lost something were never fans of the game.  Yea. Like today's KKR match, and here I am, browsing reddit. Even two years ago, I would've been hooked to the screen. I havent watched cricket since dhoni won us the world cup I don't even know why Indians like cricket so much. There are other sports as well.  It's not just the IPL. It's cricket as a sport which has become dull and boring for me. As an Indian, I already feel the pride of knowing that my team is (arguably) the best in the world. But can we now move on and set bigger targets more appropriate for the second most populous nation? 

I can't seem to understand why everyone continues to ignore the fact that we are horrible at football, hockey, basketball, tennis and pretty much all major sports that have global participation. Isn't it extremely myopic to ignore our failure in producing world class athletes despite having a population of 1.3 billion, and continuously engage in this 6 nation circle-jerk that contemporary cricket has become?  Hello unkills You watched it for 1 season more then me.  I've lost interest in cricket itself. The last time i watched cricket was the 2011 world cup. Now I think cricket is just a waste of time. Cricket nowadays specially IPL has become like WWE nowadays, totally scripted. Sports is boring,same bullshit getting repeated again and again. Ipl is fixed PSL is the new IPL.

For a student living in Bangalore,

 having a decent mileage( i guess 90-100 kmpl is very good, which i wanted,  but I have little knowledge on bikes)

good engine capacity(like 125-150cc)

the specifications i have written are an approximate requirement. Therefore I am asking help and recommendations from you guys.

I wanted a bike mainly for daily commute, occasional long distance travels(like for tours), etc.",Rajatbhat," Which bike gives 90-100? Damn. Low cc = high mileage
High cc = low mileage 

If u want to add bit of touring go for 150cc bikes as it will fit ur needs and comes with abs as well nowadays. Gixxer, apache, unicorn, hornet, Avenger, pulsar are some options all will give around 45 to 50. None of the bikes will give u 90kmpl. Maybe 100cc patina might but still I'm not sure. Honda CB shine SP, Bajaj Discover 150F, Bajaj Pulsar 135 LS, Bajaj Discover 125, Hero Glamour, Hero MotoCorp Achiever, TVS Star City Plus, TVS Sport, Bajaj Platina, Hero splendour plus, Hero splendour ismart 110, Hero passion Pro i3s, Honda Livo.

I've listed some 100 CC bikes too coz 100cc bikes are the ones which give best mileage.

Platina, TVS Star City, TVS Sport, Passion Pro Splendour ismart or Splendour plus give 80+ mileage in the bikes I've listed above. Bajaj platina is rated at 90kmpl so probably 80kmpl real world. I'd rather go for a scooter and sacrifice some mileage cause as per my experience cheap bikes arnt that great to ride.

Edit: for long rides don't even think of a 100cc bike. I'd say Apache RTR 160 and up is only suitable and nothing below. TVS Radeon Either wait for an electric bike or buy a second hand bike for less. Motorbikes in your budget (100-125cc): TVS Star City, Hero Honda Slendor, Bajaj Platina, etc.  
Scooter in your budget (100-125cc): Honda Activa, TVS Jupiter, etc.   
  
Keep in mind the on-road price adds registration + lifetime road tax + insurance premium + dealer handling charges*. IRDAI changes in Sep 2018 mandates purchase of new 2 wheelers to include a 5 year insurance policy for third party. It's a multi-year policy but added to your on-road cost. I think prices went up ~ Rs 3.2k for bikes upto 150cc.
  
Motorbikes in your budget range which will not be convenient for those occasional long distance travels. Either increase your budget to around 1L for 150-160cc bikes or consider a utility scooter given that you will be driving in Bangalore traffic. I'd pick an Activa for utility instead of Bajaj Platini bike. Ofcourse it's purely a personal preference. Honda Unicorn Look into a preowned unicorn or activa. Search on olx/quikr et al to get an idea of the price. Try and get a 2-3 year old slightly used model. Should set you around 40k all in. Please do invest in a good helmet. Mileage from the activa should hover around 40ish in real city conditions.

Sports,These boys in blue have had a fantastic few years too!,2563,adrcth,https://i.redd.it/u4ux5qpa55921.jpg,81,,ZombieGombie," Despite the lack of interest, compared to cricket,  their hindered funding, these men have showed an entire nation what passion for a sport can achieve. Proud of our blue army. yup hopefully in a decade we can be under 50 maybe. I wish to see India Participate in a World cup one day. I think this may have a lot to do with ISL. Which is fantastic, because that should be the purpose of such large format leagues.

ISL started the league in 2014 and this can't be just a random coincidence.

There were championships and leagues before as well, but they were just too marginal or small. It is sad that we need glitz and glam to grow sports, but hey, the good news is that it does work! Brilliant! Wish to see them in World Cup in my lifetime  Is the image copied from the TMNT template? Weird choice leaving the head bands in.  Yet they dont get the attention from media which they deserve  India plays their next game against UAE on 10th January. Do join us at /r/IndianFootball for match day festivities. Hope to see you all there! FIFA rankings are shit, but yeah India has undoubtedly improved! Thai game was the reassurance. It‚Äôs sad that they get so little from our nation. Still, sooooo proud of them üéâ Nice  So proud to witness the rise of Indian Football ! Ordinary citizens won't like a game as long as they don't play it or connect with it themselves. Indians grow while playing cricket and hence develop a liking for the game over time. Football is mostly played in North-eastern parts and West Bengal, but it isn't as mainstream as cricket.

Now to make football a popular sport in the country we should promote the game in the grassroot level first rather than just creating ads which force people to be a fan of the game. Kinda miss Robin Singh on both football and cricket now  All we need is to stand with them as we did with our cricket team make them A STAR too like cricket players.

Only posting on Social media Is not Enough for them I think.

And sorry for the reaction but, they really need our support now

Sports,My rant - Lunacy of Indian liberals,24,b5hi6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b5hi6f/my_rant_lunacy_of_indian_liberals/,72,"My rant is solely based on what I read on Twitter, and may not be reflective of all liberals. 

Yes. I am a a liberal and can't stand the divide that Modi's propaganda has created in Indian society. But an opposition of right wing ideology doesn't mean that you end up supporting INC and its policies, which are not completely liberal either.

Their are certain well known (blue tick) handles on Twitter, who have a liberal viewpoint. Few live abroad. I normally agree with their viewpoints, but much to my dismay, some of them seem to support INC, and are happy to see Priyanka join the campaign. Those people have completely forgotten how the nepotism in INC, It's corruption or how it has exploited minorities for its own gain, say Shahbano case.

But this is just the beginning. In their hatred for Modi and his supporters, these handles seem to support or retweet (fundamentalist) Muslim ideology. For anyone who has spent last 30-40 years observing Indian society must have sure seen the gradual shift in ideology of Indian Muslims too. Sudden religious awakening, donning of beard/Hijab (As a kid, never saw a Muslim woman wearing a Hijab). 

Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

TL;DR - how does rejection of Hindutva rationalise support of Islamic fundamentalism? If you are a true liberal, why can't you condemn both kinds of fundamentalism?",baawri_kathputli," [deleted] Can you give some examples of the fundamentalism view points that they agree with? Maybe they are not liberal to begin with. Them calling themselves liberal is only as legitimate as BJP calling themselves the representatives of Hindus As a muslim I'm wondering that this 'rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values' means.


Either way, I'd say the rising Hindutva caused Muslims to move towards a more conservative Islam. The Babri masjid was a culmination of anti muslim efforts that solidified the divide between hindus and muslims. RSS has been hard at work at unifying hinduism and it has done so by othering muslims. no secret there

 Whether you like it or not , we live in a pluralistic society so there is no distinction between Indian values and Islamic values , rather it is a superset of all religious values . Islamic extremism and fundamentalism is now a global problem but you are making things worse by giving counter productive measures which are perceived as Anti Muslim sentiment .  I sport a  beard and am an  Hindu. What's how you look got to do with anything ? Isn't it my choice what I wear/What look I sport ? If anybody is forcing me to do something that's a different matter but what are choices that I made of my own volition got to do with hypocrisy .  The problem with most Muslim Indians is that they r usually from lower middle class where religion plays a heavy role. As people become rich they would start becoming more integrated  Who is supporting Islamic Fundamentalism in opposition to Hindutva? It looks like you've been reading a lot of RW Twitter and it's percolated.

The only difference between your arguments and a generic RW argument is that you've prefaced yours with ""I am a liberal"" with a heavy dose of r/EnlightenedCentrism > Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

Lol no. Even before Independence there was Hindu-Muslim rivalry to the extent that the Muslims wanted a separate country. Most bhakts still bring up Akbar and Aurangzeb and rant about how they destroyed temples and whatnot. 
 > I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

If you call yourself a liberal after making this bigoted statement that completely whitewashes history, you need to take a long lok at yourself in the mirror.

Hatred of muslims is going on this country for decades. Advani led a stupid ac rath yatra to pull down a archeologically significant mosq in 1992, FFS. What has changed is that the present government has made it easy for bigots to come out of the woodwork and wear their bigotry on their sleeves. I'm totally against Modi but I don't support INC either. To be honest I don't support anyone. I just go to BJP posts and write *Gali gali me shor hain, chowkidar chor hain* to get those Chowkidars offended. And you should stay away from Twitter if you are looking for real political discussions. Reddit is a better place. [removed] What's wrong with donning a beard? 

I think Burqa is wrong and subjugates a women's identity. 

>Islamophobia in West and India have completely different roots IMO. I think for Indians, it's the rejection of Indian values by Muslims and shift towards Islamic values, that has Hindus riled up.

That's what Ram Mandir is about? Is Ram Mandir an Indian value? 

I think the real big fundamentalism that is a problem is Zakir Naik. 

https://thewire.in/communalism/zakir-naik-communal-agenda-malaysia


 [removed] The hypocrisy. Wantimg a Hindu Rashtra is not ""anti-Indian"" Wearing a beard is? Fucking bullshit. all major political parties have used religion to favor their agenda , no question about that. BJP is just too good at it , mostly because of their history(RSS). I won't vote for BJP since they are hell bent on destroying the cultural fabric of india , which has been present for 100s of years . if they can't guarantee safety to their citizens(muslims are citizens right?) , what's the point of governance anyways.

&#x200B;

Also one question as a food for thought.

&#x200B;

Muslims have been living in this country for over a 1000 years now , they have every right to claim India as their native land, anybody who believes that Muslims will leave India and go to Pakistan, has basically given up on all reason.

&#x200B;

Once we wake up and understand the above reality. there is only one option , we have to vote for politics which doesn't capitalize on this divide and actively works to cement it for peace and harmony.

&#x200B;

Sadly , I have yet to see such a party in India

&#x200B;

EDIT: Congress was no good either , but atleast in congress government muslims didn't enter hindu houses on filmsy pretexts , and beat up entire family.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B; I have talked to many muslims , over a period of time  and all of them , agree that the maulvis (religious leader) are the ones behind encouraging fundamentalism , while most of the Muslims don't care much. same is the case with hindus , majority of hindus don't have a real problem with muslims , its just that religious and political leaders on both sides , keep harping on whatever issue they can find.

&#x200B;

we as citizens have to see through it and vote appropriately

#EDIT
As some have pointed out, and I agree, that this is in no way proof or indicator that these three are better than the greats mentioned in the list. There are too many variables like home/away split, no. of matches they played together, quality of opposition etc. The thing to emphasize here is that they are 'among the best' and it was something unprecedented from Indian team. I remember the time when Venkatesh Prasad's fast deliveries were slower than Kumble's slow ones.

The current crop have been brilliant. If only our batting line up were a little more consistent overseas, we'd have won more than one Test in each of those series outside of India. If our batting was consistent, we could have won the series in England and Australia.  Is this for when the three of them played together? Or if in one match Umesh was in instead of Shami, for example, would the other two's wickets still add up to the total? Misleading stat. For every other trio they are showing the stats for games all played together, whereas for Indian bowlers their grand totals for the year are taken into account. Bumrah missed first 2 tests in Eng which Shami and Ishant played. For Grand totals Steyn,Ntini,Morkel have 171 in 2008 but they show only 123


Edit: looks it‚Äôs only away for away tests but it‚Äôs not doing justice to other bowlers as their away test matches include not so pacer friendly pitches of subcontinent. 

with Bumrah‚Äôs introduction Indian bowling has definitely improved in tests TBH I'm surprised Jimmy+Broad+Woakes/Stokes/Bresnan/Misc don't feature in the top 5. What about the number of matches played? I hope SENA keeps preparing bowler friendly like they have this season.  Some people are laughing that cricket is followed with such a Zeal in a former colonial state... 

I mean it's one thing to beat them on their own turf, and another abandoning all reason and sports.  Awesome.. but no terror in the heart .. which Holding and company invoked. Bumrah has really shown immense talent n balled on spot Interestingly enough this stat isn‚Äôt showing how many matches they played for those wickets I‚Äôm sure India plays 3 times more test in a year than those guys ever did  Wonderful stat...Bumrah has certainly the potential to become the greatest Indian pace bowler of all time And this is excluding bhuvi's contribution Fuck cricket. [deleted] Wow..  surprisingly there are no Australians  Yeah but back then there was no match fixing. Today all matches are more or less fixed, so can't say that the information or statistics are accurate. Doesn't cricket get enough media attention already? Rather bland content considering this is reddit.
Just my opinion that's all. I don't particularly like or dislike cricket,but I am rather tired of reading about it everywhere.
For instance, recently, we partook in a Hockey world cup and were consequently eliminated in the quarter-finals. All the newspapers I have access to either relegated this news to the last page favouring the test match against Australia over it, or didn't mention it at all. I get that they're trying to sell their papers, albeit I think a full fledged world-cup takes precedence over a run-off-the-mill test match.
We are hasteful to be delighted about our athletes performing well in various sports, albeit when it comes to supporting those very athletes, we turn our backs and cast them a blind eye.
India needs to learn to comprehend and be privy to all of its talent, not just a select few. I find it rather sad, or moreover callous that Sunil Chhetri had to do what he did just to get people to come and watch the national team play ON HOME SOIL. Very very sad indeed.

We don't need to organise any new global sports events.

All you hear after these events are hosted is how the players had a bad experience, how scams were undergone. No thanks.  oLyMpICs is aNTiNusHnAl No need to call it ""suspended"". It is obvious that if we host game and then don't let some team enter our country boundaries itself, we're modifying the competition. It's a pretty logical thing, and I don't thing we should even bother about it considering the current circumstances. Well we deserve it. I don't see why issues of borders and national security must seep into the fields of sports and the arts where people mostly do it for themselves and not for the glorification of a flag.

Throughout my childhood I have been an introvert, preferred staying inside my room watching movies and stuff. When I got into college, whenever my friends asked me for outdoor games, I always excused myself. I know this was a huge mistake as college gives you platform for learning these stuff. You can call it laziness or shyness or lack of awareness or some other reason that doesn't matter now. Since I have started my job, I have realised the importance of these activities and want to learn them now, but I can't seem to find any place that can help me learn all that at this age. Any help?",mindlessCoder," This post summarised my life are you skinny too?

Coz that's will sum up me. I suggest shooting

Edit: tartget shooting g fuckin marksmanship post. Chutya. Start running.  Mine was totally opposite. Till 18, I played Cricket, Football, Badminton, Table Tennis, Track&Field and Hockey (sometimes) and was into NCC. I was like crazy into sports, followed everything from nba to tennis to badminton to cricket etc etc. They used to air sportscenter on ESPN India @8pm which I would watch with full excitement. I played at district level and a couple of cbse clusters. So I'd say for my entire teen years I liked to play and be outdoors most of the time, going around, riding bicycles and doing shit. Well, sadly life took a 360. I moved to a different town, lost all my school friends plus went out of state for college. At college, all of my interest got lost somehow and done nothing except binge and sleeping. In other words, I turned into an extreme intorverted guy and felt comfortable around myself and started to grow my hair to look cool and headbang a little. Well, there's one thing that helped me by playing different games was fitness. Football and Badminton helped my leg muscles a lot and I think also helped my height ig. I haven't been to a gym ( to this day ) and don't plan to because I never needed to.
23 now btw. Life's been depressed for the last 4 years. I get emotional thinking how cool my teen life was. Now everything is shit. 
Good luck to you.

 I find outdoor activities useless.
Lets say I play cricket. 

While batting , I hit a shot. Some cringy kid shouts ""Oyeee abe shai se bol fek na yaar"". I just stand there and wobble my butt. I waste 30 seconds waiting for another ball.

Some kid does a good fielding while the wicket keeper shouts ""Are chaccha chaccha chacchaaaa chaccchhhaaaa. Oyeeee sahi hai sahi hai sahi haiiiii!""

Batsmen running with their balla and wobbling butt.

Ballers shouting oooyeeee after every ball.

Fielders clapping because there is nothing else to do.

Outdoor activities are super mega cringy for me. I feel like smashing my bat on the face of every player that shouts or claps because he has to do ""something"" and can not stand idle. Starting off is the hardest part. Pick a sport and try to get into it. You should be able to find Badminton, Tennis, Cricket academies fairly easily. Find a sports complex or the kind. Or move to a building with a clubhouse. That'll be a good start. 

I'd recommend gym but typical Indian gyms are filled with steroid junkies and steroid recommending trainers specially when you're skinny.

I have recently started learning Badminton. The fuckers who play well try to fuck with you showing their game off, the best way is to not lose your will to learn and focus on getting as good as them and bearing them. 

I know people who started learning tennis when I played fairly Well and started bearing me in 7-8 months.

There are good technical guides to each sport online. By saying that 22 y/o is too late to start playing is a very lame excuse. Get your lazy ass up and start playing a game in which you have interest. You can start with TT, badminton etc.

I am assuming you don't go to gym so you can start focusing on your physique by joining a gym, first few weeks would be tough but once you get past it then it will get easier.

But seriously dude, GET YOUR LAZY ASS TO WORK Try Playo app.. The more you play the quickly you learn... Also, you can play Squash.. It is one of the few games which you can learn playing solo...  OP, first of all why do you want to get into sports? You say you have realized it is important. I don't deny the benefits, but what is your end goal?

Is it something specific like playing at a professional level or just something to keep you active and engaged?

If it is the latter, learn like how a child would. Just by playing it for fun. Find some of your colleagues who'd go for playing sports and ask them to tag you along for a game. Regularly do that. You will not only learn the sport gradually, but you'll have fun doing it as well. Not to mention that it will vastly improve your social circle.  Really depends on where you're from but there's always coaching centers for most sports. No age is too late to join these classes. My uncle started Table Tennis coaching at 40 years age and now he's addicted to it. You gotta spend money but that money is definitely worth it in the long run. What do u like to do most? If u like cricket, hang out near cricket grounds and start talking to them. They can always use an extra player. Same with any other sports. 

If u don't ask, u wont get it. Start making progress little by little. 22 is still young to give up.  Bowling. It is really fun.   Advice from 29 year old guy:

- Smoked from 18 years to 28 years. realised its a huge mistake and here is how I got into active sports.

- stopped smoking cold turkey.

- Started running, small distances and sprints. progressed and completed Two Half Marathons.
- Bought bike(cycle) and along with running, ride 25-50 kms. If you can't bike daily, then on weekend ride 30-50kms. It looks daunting but your legs will get used to it.
- Start Badminton.
- Start Swimming.

Schedule:

- 2-3 times running
- 1-2 times Badminton
- 1-2 times Bike
- 1-2 times swimming

Now start looking into Marathons/Dualthon/Traithlon. Forget social media and open account in starva, follow people and sync your activities there.

If at 29 years I could do it, you are just 22 and can definitely do it. 

Good luck.  Honestly it'll be very tough for you to get into a sport at this age. I assume you'd want to play with people your age cause it'll be weird for you to play with school kids right. Unfortunately most people your age would be those who actively enjoy the sport and have been playing for many years. They'll be way better than a noob and you won't be able to develop your skills to a good enough level to enjoy playing with them.",2019-03-05 05:28:26

Sindhu will get Rs 40 crore as sponsorship while the rest will be for equipment, so it is close to Rs 50 crore,"" Kapoor told ToI and added that they are looking forward to a long term association with Sindhu and Kidambi Srikanth.

Anushka: ""mm, its nice but next time I wanna go to my favorite Italian restaurant.""

Kohli: ""I don't think you should live in India. Go and live in Italy. Why are you living in our country and loving other countries? I don't mind you not liking my food but I don't think you should live in our country and like other's thing. Get your priorities sorted.""   His inner bhakt surfaces. Khud shaadi baahar ja kar ki thi, wahi reh jaaye.

Not that I think like that, but I am applying his argument to him. This leave if you don't like something argument is pure retarted. Why is this argument so popular? I don't like foreign batsmen nor Indian ones, but if you are paying for my tickets and visa then I'll say that I like foreign batsmen more than Indians. Get me moving now! BTW I like New Zealand batsmen better just so you know where to send me. Fortunately that fan didn't say that he likes to see Pakistani batsmen in action. Otherwise he would have celebrated this Diwali in Pakistan. Nice political play there kohli. Polarize first! Address the issue later. How I wish this was fake. Is bhenchod ke liye jo zaraa sa  respect tha, woh bhi nahi rahega bahut jald. At least sehwag showed his colours *after* his career over, yeh to abhi shuru ho gaya.  This is a statement of inadequacy from a batsman who has it all to become a legend of the game  Sir but i have a Aadhaar card. 'Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel' By his logic he should - Sponsor only indian brands, leave India if you sponsor uber, nike, nestle, puma. Set your priorities right Virat. Ponting was my favourite batsman, Sachin was third most favourite, Dada being second.  kek! help me with visa, travel and settling in the new land. Although I like indian batsmen but I am ready to settle abroad. This comment section, twitter outrage shows why India will never have any show like Colbert, Bill Maher, John Oliver or any political comedy show. It you read the article it says he was responding to mean comments, like ""mean tweets"". If you think he would risk millions of $s of contracts, you need to think again. His response was really bad, the response should be 5-6 words max and shouldn't need to be explained. I feel like that comment might be fake, it sounds very condescending, ""these Indians"" I mean WTF. Also don't think anyone would describe Kohli as ""overrated batsman. Nothing seems special in his batting."" Kohli is the one of the few batsmen that is succeeding at all format.  Seemed kinda like those Jimmy kimmel mean tweet  thing people really need to loosen up these days.kohli isn‚Äôt known for his wit seemed like a poor joke nothing more nothing less. Top meme material right here. Cricketers shouldn't even joke these days because people will find some reason to get offended. This too with Kohli whose favorite batsman is probably ABD. Looks like most ppl didn't even watch the video to get the context. No wonder media can polarise people with their headlines. Its deeply upsetting.This is why we can't have nice things. Have hordes of ultra regressive conservative people in the country is bad enough. Just wake up and understand the context before you get all hyper and start hating the guy who is most likely more liberal than you. Idiots.. Comment taken out of context. 

Could have handled it better, yes. But it is not that big a deal it is made out to be. I hate it when people who have never watched sports in their lives start talking shit about players because of a random misinformed bias. He said in mockering way. He is kind of person who replies with BC to his bully while hugs to his friend. The questioner asked cringy question and the inner Delhi boi of kohli activated. That's it. Nothing else to discuss. This is ridiculously poor by Kohli. I thought Kohli of 2018 had matured in to a sensible stand up guy.  Any sport transcends nationalities and it's perfectly alright to have idols from other nationalities. How many kids growing up had their idols as Gilchrist, ABD, Sachin, Shane Warne, Mcgrath etc. That has nothing to do with nationality. Just shows is Kohli's mentality in a very poor light. This guy is such a dumb snobby arrogant bhakt! He thought Demonetization was the greatest political move ever.

Now he is asking people to leave India. This guy will be the CM of UP after fake Yogi becomes PM.


> ""For me, it's the greatest move that I've seen in the history of Indian politics, by far. I've been so impressed by it, it's unbelievable what has happened,"" Kohli said at the pre-match press conference. Source: https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/cricket/story/virat-kohli-demonetisation-india-prime-minister-narendra-modi-352256-2016-11-16 This despite the fact that he knows that there are so many AB fans in India and he has acknowledged this fact himself so many times.
I think this was his brainfade moment. Unsure about the authenticity of the video. If it's real though, I find it hilarious he said that, especially since he didn't get married in India. Same logic hold true, no? Kohli's chaddi is showing. First deploying [Gautam Gambhir and MS Dhoni as the face of BJP](https://www.timesnownews.com/sports/cricket/article/ms-dhoni-gautam-gambhir-likely-to-contest-on-bjp-ticket-in-2019-lok-sabha-elections-report/302547). Next, [removing high protein food like beef from the cricketer's menu](https://newsd.in/bcci-asks-cricket-australia-to-remove-beef-from-indias-menu/).

And now naming non-supporters as anti-Indians.

RSS wants to use the soft power of cricket to influence millions of Indians to abhor people who eat beef or non-supporters as anti-Indians, further creating divisive lines in our country and to push their own communal agenda.

I won't be surprised if in future Muslim players like Shami and Khaleel Ahmed get dropped from the Indian Cricket Team all Indians should leave India The beauty of any sports is the fact it transcends all barriers and binds people together in a common thread. Jingoism should have no place in it. I am a Virat Kohli fan because of his hard work and attitude but this shit is ridiculous.  I don't like any batsman,  i just hate virat koli. Does this mean i can stay?  I remember him using a stool to stand next to a tall female sportsperson. While undoubtedly a brilliant cricketer, not the brightest of bulbs otherwise.

We‚Äôd do better as a race if we follow people who are actually serving society than being insanely good at hitting a ball. I wonder what he has to say about the thousands of desi expat fans who come to see him and the Indian team play in the UK/Australia/other countries. Haha... Kohli should watch mean tweets. The Vedas say that all true Indians should believe India is the best at everything. Those who don't should go to Pakistan. I like lara more than anyone , I like Denis lily as bowler than anyone else.
 [Very relevant.](http://imgur.com/gallery/uwMGKtk) Lol reactions here are over the top to something taken out of context. I always wonder with guys like this if they believe that Indians still cheering for Indian sportsmen/women while living in America should come back to India? I am shocked and mind-blown that a progressive intellectual like Kohli has said this. Pfft. Fucking wanker. Intellect inversely proportional to batting skills....Indians have the habit of making gods of celebs, and to an extent then some will even try to justify their stupid remarks. Lol. Kiddo got offended  Why all of sudden he sounds like a BJP person ? He recently tweeted about his partnership with Tissot and he is their brand ambassador. Someone should tell him that if he prefers a foreign brand over Ajanta watches then he should leave India The country's been bhakt-up.  What else did you all expect from a modi fan. First, see the video and listen to the way he's speaking and then post such stuff. Don't make it look out more than what it is. Blowing things out of proportion. Are gusse me boldiya Kohli paaji ne. Har cheese Dil pe lene ki zarurat nahi. Ab dilli ke punjabi chokre apne logic ke like thodi jaane jaate Hain. Happy Cake Day a-manyavar. So if there is a match in India between 2 foreign countries, whom do we support? Flashback, it's 1942 all over again :p The BC intervention seems to have worked though Now I get it why we need Dhoni behind the stumps when he is captaining the side... So after Sehwag and Dhoni, Kohli preparing for a BJP ticket too? This man still doesn't have 'control over his mouth' at the big age of 30 sadly. The Australian media had a lovely time due to this during their test series here in 2017. Typical TDC. This arrogant prick is Indian cricket's Modi. OP‚Äôs user name makes sense.

Virat Kohli, you Sir are an idiot. He is becoming too arrogant ,if this is his statement Taken out of context, the 'Fan' pretty much called the Greatest Batsman at the moment overrated and then said that he'd rather watch Australians or English than 'these' Indians. Lol, definitely deserved what he got as a reply.  Kohli only says this because he knows Smith is the true test chad Ok. Deal. Give me money to emigrate and i'm off to Australia for life. Tere baap ka hai kya india? chutiye Leave India if you like foreign wedding venues more than Indian ones.

Chutiya. His tone sounds very different in text and in video, but nevertheless that's a very stupid thing to say. Thought his PR team would have told him to handle it better and say the right things. Where cricket is the definition of patriotism.  One thing we need to learn is that good actors/artists/authors/sportsmen can be absolute rubbish humam beings. And it's fine. They don't owe anyone anything. They should be known for their craft and that's that.  I really live him as a cricketer, he has actually worked very hard and used his natural talent to be at zenith of the cricket. But this is an absolute rubbish reaction, you should only like Indian things otherwise you should leave the country!! Really who choose a foreign country for his marriage celebration, has sponsorship deals with multiple foreign brands like Puma, Audi, Tissot, Col-Pal more. üò∂ Never liked him and his smugface. And, I love Cricket. The most shameful disgustingly highest run scorer who has shitty personality in India as a sportsman. Infact he is no sportsman at all.  Virat Kohli for all his glories as a batsman is a short tampered goon.

I don't like him at all. He is by far the worst person to be a captain of any team. It is clearly evedent that how he is a proper failure WITH RCB when he doesn't get the same guidance on how to run a team.  Waah. Those who endorse foreign brands like puma and oppo should leave also Replace"" batsmen"" with ""pornstars"" and read again.  Ah, I was wondering when the ""Delhi"" in him would start to show. About time.  What an utterly douchenozzley response from Kohli. Don't know what the guy he responded to meant by 'these Indians' though.  Virat Kohli : [*""Demonetisation is greatest move in history of Indian politics, says Virat Kohli""*](https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/demonetisation-is-greatest-ever-move-in-history-of-indian-politics-virat-kohli-4378322/) Batsmen outside, chutiya inside.  I don't think he meant that as is. Even I was slightly irked by that person's choice of words - as if he was trying to irritate Kohli deliberately. Notice that the person used words like English, Australian, rather than pointing out what actually they found in them other country players that ""Indian"" players were lacking,rather than them being Indian. 

Although Virat could've answered more clearly, I don't think it's his fault that he replied in such a manner.  Cricket is a pathetic, boring colonial game and such cringe does not help its case.

Someone needs to stop this overhyped crap sport from discrediting potential for other sports in this country already. He can go fuck himself.  Again this retard with his verbal diarrhea.  I think this is just a knee jerk reaction to criticism from a sportsman who has dedicated his life to the game. No one expects a leader of the sport to say something like this, but maybe just Kohli's immaturity in handling unexpected statements. Hopefully, he can work on it and improve. I liked this guy though i dont follow cricket anymore. Didnt know Kohli was a first grade cunt. Dilli ka chhora hai. Mean comments ko pyaar se reply nahi karega. Responding sledging with sledging. Videshi cricketers know it very well, now indian critics too.

Proud of you Kohli! Feels like most people don't get sarcasm nor do they have a sense of humour. Cricketers who have a political opinion like Kolhi, Sehwag, Gambhir should be arrested.  What does ""these Indians"" mean  Get a batting average like Don Bradman. Then tell other Indians to leave India I don't even like cricket. I think it's stupid. What should I do?

I love how he reads a comment on the internet and thinks that he should now weigh in as to what the person should do with his life. 

It wasn't even that bad a comment. Looks like we have a snowflake here.

Edit: Afterthought So, it comes to pass: After the politicians, babas and VCs, an entertainer is educating Indians about this 'art of nationalism'. I don't even watch or have slight interest in cricket. Where should I go ü§î Anushke "" Leave me if you jerk off to Sunny Leone"" Shaadi kahe India me  ahi ki fir? [deleted] Never ever feed a troll.

Thoda aadjeyst karlo bhai! Fuck this guy....why can't you admire and like another batsman even if you live and are an Indian.   It's a game you chutia not a war your a sports person not a soldier, you my man have issues.   

Ja Anushka ka loda chuss to shayad koi buddi ayegi.... fuckwad. Bharat Ratna for Kohli is now confirmed Any other source on this? Next time if any organisation thinks to make kohli an ambassador of a noble cause it should think hundreds of time. Sports are always considered containing some force of unity or togetherness. It follows that representative of a sport should never be unmindful of his duties. By advocating popular and rabid form of nationalism kohli has done huge disservice.
P.S. Now we should not expect from cricket to heal our relationship with a certain neighbour. ""He is overated"" This statement is enough to prove that his comment is worth ignoring. No need to respond",2018-11-07 22:42:28
Sports,"Betting / Gambling is taken as a serious issue in India, then how come Cricketers are promoting apps like Dream11 when it's based on money? Just another way of Betting / Gambling correct?",23,b66hl0,https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/b66hl0/betting_gambling_is_taken_as_a_serious_issue_in/,16,,neilupinto," Betting is not legal in India (depending on the type of betting and place, again), but fantasy sports is legal.

As per Sec 12 of Public Gambling Act of India, ""skill based games are not covered under gambling in India"".

Hence games like fantasy cricket/sports and rummy for that reason, come under ""skill based games"" hence out of the purview of gambling.

While lottery, betting on sports (not fantasy sports), and other card games like flush etc come under betting.  There was a case againt dream11 and they won. Google it. Skill games - No ban, but again the decision is taken by the state law.

Dream11 & Online Rummy - does not falls under gambling as these games requires skills to play.

Though few states like - Telangana, kerala, assam, nagaland & orissa banned all the games where money is involved.

Supreme court gave rule rummy as game of skill but few states banned it. Although site owners are fighting for this but no result yet. Gambling law in India is a bit complicated. For something to be gambling you generally need the following components:

1. Uncertain event - you don't know what the outcome will be.
2. Consideration - you're paying something to participate. 
3. Prize - you are competing or participating for a prize.

You need all three elements. Zynga poker is not prohibited because there is no prize (under Indian law). 

Generally, games of skill are not treated as gambling. Different states have imposed different standards. Telangana took the position that ANY element of chance would make it a game of chance. West Bengal on the other hand, treats poker as a game of skill. This boils down to whether a game is preponderantly that of skill or chance. 

The Supreme Court has some cases in which they decided whether some games are gambling. 

1. Horse race betting - game of skill - people can research conditions of horse, skill of jockey, etc. That takes skill. 

2. Rummy - game of skill - can learn card combinations, etc

3. Poker (Gujarat HC) - game of chance - no skill involved and poker is preponderantly a game of chance. (Lol)

Basically a lot of things are uncertain until a court decides if a game is predominantly that of skill or chance. 

 It depends on region to region. That's what I have seen  They'll do anything for money. There's no surprise there. If the company gets caught doing something illegal, the most these cricketers/actors say is, ""sorry, I was not aware of this"".

The show that I really wanted to watch is 'It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia' but I heard that Hotstar was self censoring their contents and that would take all the fun away from 'Always Sunny' since it's quite crass. That's one of the reasons why I like the show.

So should I spend my ‚Çπ1,000 on an annual subscription or just do the diddly-doo to watch?",refreshnamesuggested," That's 80 bucks per month. I'm sure you can afford that. If you still want to pirate content when there are cheap alternatives available, that's left to you. Do it. More people we get on legal way of watching things, more things will get to see. Also, feels good to give back to your favourite actors/director/producers.  I'm not sure about the censorship but I'd definitely get it for the sports itself, they have almost all the sports minus wwe and champions League football. Everything else is on it. Sometimes i wonder that myself, I took their one year sports pack to watch the IPL last year and I haven't used it again since... If you are paying it for HBO originals then its fine. I cancelled mine after 2 years because of how horrible their sports streaming were especially premier league. I had a lot of problems with any Man u and Arsenal matches. 

I wouldn't recommend it for streaming sports.  don't know much about the shows but their sports plan @299 is totally worth it ( I got it when they were giving 200rs cashback if paid by paytm) Hey guys, Im a hotstar premium subscriber... But I‚Äôm not able to stream GOT in 1080p on my iphone. It‚Äôs maxed out to 720p. Does anybody face this problem?  Yes. For the serials. Not a sports viewer. Good serials and it streams well most of the time.

The Apple TV app though is pure shit.  I think it's absolutely worth it if you like TV shows.

 It has great shows not available elsewhere like sopranos, the wire, band of brothers, silicon valley, the shield, deadwood, twin peaks, justified, plus nearly every popular sitcom.

Although yeah iasip is censored and it does spoil the jokes frequently, like in the pilot they cut out the entire closing scene. 

I've had it for several years and I think it's worth the money. I use it for premier league, I paid 200 for a year. In US they recently had a promo for 10$ for a year..!  It's definitely worth the yearly premium subscription money. It has a lot of good TV shows and movies and so much sports content. The other good thing about it is that all the Disney Plus Originals would be made available on Hotstar in India and that makes it too good a deal to say no to.

Reliance is a commercial partner of AIFF and pays AIFF annually 50 crores rupees.
They have a direct say in the critical affairs of the team including selection of coaches after the inclusion of Sundar Raman in the all important technical committee.
This article is date from 2017 but is important now since the resignation of Steven Constantine as the coach of the National Team.

Not a football fan but would love to see indian football succeed and to that end I want to start following it from now on. Reliance is a private entity and I'm not sure why they'd want to to be involved in such a thing and we can of course discuss the visual of a private body doing something like this. But if they are involved I'm sure they're in it for the ‚Çπ‚Çπ. To eventually own the league formats and take it the cricket board route which is super rich. And so it's in their best interests to not fuck up selection and support it from the ground up. In what ways would they fuck it up? Private body involvement in cricket, hockey, kabbadi have yielded great results. Yeah it's not the traditional 'club' format just a show of such traditions but so what? Not defending Reliance, but i have seen first hand that reliance works/supports at grass-root level in football. My neighbour‚Äôs son in 6th standard got picked by reliance academy. Reliance moved him to mumbai, boarding/lodging/schooling and international level training absolutely free of cost. Last i heard, kids were being taken to London for EPL youth academy exposure. If a completly middle class KV schooled kid is being trained for future prospect, I think we should give atleast some credit to Reliance for it. Reliance/Motabhai has a say in *everything* in this country. Ambanis are the Lannisters. if reliance is involved then their end target is profit, profit which will come if the team performs . We all know the shabby football infrastructure from selection bias to corruption.

i say let's give pvt corporate a chance. Not like we are world champion or top 100 team. If reliance can invest and they think they have a shot, let them take it. ",2019-01-17 22:15:14

Devil is in the details Mnemonics. Google it. Basically 1 is sun, 2 is shoe, 3 is tree etc.  

For instance 1 is sun, I imagine a sheep with wheat instead of wool covering it swallows the sun and is thus burning. A Shepard sees it and runs after it. 

This image is easy to remember because it's so ridiculous. It helped me remember that fire blight of wheat was discovered by Shepard (atleast that was what we were taught). I learnt that many many many years ago. Unfortunately I was too lazy and drunk to put it in practice more effectively but I'm told it works. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_loci

There is a solid book called Moonwalking with Einstein which dives deep into application of such techniques. Although that might be a overkill for most people.

Another technique that I remember they used in fiitjee was repeating tapes of inorganic chemistry as whitenoise while sleeping so that it registers in the subconscious mind. Bihar's school of yoga has some books regarding this, i can't remember. Just google yoga nidra book, has plenty of whacky sleep experiments. If you understand concept then make mindmaps i.e. take important words or formulas or any small definations and structure them neatly. Revise it in your free time for 3-4 days. After that Revise the whole thing again and I am sure you will get it. write down everything after memorizing Revision is the only way to do it. Revise as much as you can.

Meanwhile, my cousins and friends who did not listen continued working on sports are now getting into prestigious international colleges due to sports quotas.

Fellow randians, how many of you really regret listening to your parent's advice. Had to write it because I had to vent my anger out somewhere.",0means," I believe everything thing that happened in my life till now is my fault and everything will be. If they said something that I think is wrong then it is my fault that I listened to them and didn't do what I feel was right. It gives you comfort that it was my fault and I wasn't helpless that I was just foolish and I can learn from my mistakes. But it doesn't mean that for every mistake you have to feel bad about it. Humans make mistake. Believe that you did your best in those circumstances and if not then you will learn from these mistakes and not repeat them. Cheers!  No. I wanted to study literature. They gave me freedom to pursue whatever I wanted to. But I don't have any motivational story to share. Following your passion doesn't ensure success. I failed to replicate those 'I followed my passion' success stories. To be frank, now I resent my so called passion. Seems your problem is constantly comparing yourself with others instead of being content in your life. Nothing is set in stone. You can still change things about your life. First of all what exactly is so miserable in your life? Parents guide us based on their experiences of life .Moreover in India , children are social securities in an indirect way.



Don't crib . Move on . And you can restart tennis . 
 What I do is just listen to their suggestions and wait until the right moment has come to tell them what I am actually going to do!

They call me ""ghaag"" for this behavior. According to them, ghaag is a person who is always consumed in self-thoughts and do not tell anyone what is he/she going to do and never listen to anyone. 

They get mad at me, but in the end, when they see me happy with my decisions, it's all good for them.

I also listen to only myself because in a case in the future if I fuck up with my life, I, by any means cannot blame my parents or anyone because all the fucking decisions were mine. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B; Until this point, you have tried what your parents told you, only because you were not passionate enough about whatever you liked.  

There is no reason for me to think you showed so much promise in Tennis that you would have done fabulously (you have not really told me about the medals you won in your engg college sports activities, or in other external sports championships). 

You knew your parents for 18 yrs. They maybe experts in engg, or they maybe farmers...but basically their advice was given based on their experiences and the best advice they got. If you didnt show enough 'ability' in tennis - how the heck will they know .. you are gifted in tennis ??

It is easy to sift all the blame onto your parents for it all, but, that will only allow you to blame them for all your future choices too. Maybe it is time to figure out what exactly you want to do with your life and what you are good at and do something. 

&#x200B; Parents advise you based on their experience. I don't think their intention was wrong. Tennis and sports actually didn't pay well at last decade or so, you have had to struggle for proper equipment let alone earninh well. I feel it should have been you who should have pushed harder and changed their mindset and showed them that there is potential. Also I guess you are in your early 20s, nothing is stopping you from pursuing something more interesting pehle main karta tha. lekin ab nahin. Now I want me and my future wife to raise my child if I have one to be independent and think for himself. sunne mein to aasaan lag raha hai but bahot mushkil hone wala hai Hmm. My parents fucked up my shit real good. And I still blame them for it. 


I'm not bitter about it, I mean they didnt fuck my shit up because they wanted to fuck me up. Really just the opposite. They just didnt know any better.


It doesnt change the fact that my shit is good as fucked, for life no less. But I'm done being bitter about it. 


I'm sure you're angry rn. I'm just saying your anger is valid. Don't take it out on them if you think their actions were motivated out of love and concern. But dont need to stop venting your frustration with friends, online or even to a sympathetic ear. 

My parents saw shitty times where they would collect melt wax and make new candles, to save money. Your parents probably did too. You cant blame them for being aspirationally conservative. Aspirations were a dangerous thing to have back then.

**Current Medal Tally**

India's medal tally as of now: 15 Gold, 24 Silver, 30 Bronze.

India is currently at the 8th position in [the medal table](https://m.sportskeeda.com/sports/asian-games-medals-table).

**Note**: Regular updates and schedule in the comments. 

**The Games have ended!**",snicker33," Update - Hockey: India wins Men's Hockey Pool A Prelims, beating Hong Kong by 26-0. WTF?! Update - Gymnastics: Dipa Karmakar qualifies for the final of the beam event. Apparently, Iranian women's Kabaddi coach is from India and wanted to coach the Indian team but never got the opportunity. She then decided to accept the Iranian offer to prove her mettle. Hi all,

To those not aware one of the reasons for India's better showings at Asian Games,CWG and Olympics is due to several previous sportsmen like Geet Sethi, Prakash Padukone, Pulella Gopichand and Rahul Dravid and their foundations [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/) and [GoSports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/) who support several players like Duttee Chand, Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Swapna Barman and many more. You can check their websites for more information.

If you would like to donate to any of these you can do at [Gosports](http://www.gosportsfoundation.in/donate_now.php) and [Olympic Gold Quest](https://www.olympicgoldquest.in/donate-now.php) Not relevant but India got a bronze in eSports! Hima Das is absolute beast.  Neeraj Chopra has won the gold !!!! What an athlete.  Four valid throws and all well above 80m. The fact that his least throw was better than silver medalist's best is a testimony of how good the guy is.  8 gold medals denied to India by Bahrain+Qatar. 1 Gold denied to China.
If there were no Bahrain+Qatar.
India would have 15 Golds to China's 13 and be number 1 in athletics in Asia. Quite a feat by our athletics team. Holy fack!! 88.06m at the age of 20. Neeraj Chopra, what a guy. So that concludes the athletics events at 2018 Asian Games. What a superb performance by Indian athletics contingent winning 19 medals(7 gold, 10 silver amd 2 bronze). Update - Swimming: Virdhawal Khade finishes 4th in Men's 50m Freestyle Final clocking 22.47s. 

Missed Bronze by 0.01 seconds! Update: India's women Kabaddi team finishes on top of table, qualifies for semi-finals.  Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Sharan Divij enter semis, assure another medal for India

 Deepika kumari has been disappointing on every big ticket event. She goes into tournaments as world number 1 and  does really bad. The federation really needs to get her a mental conditioning coach asap. Sindhu is in the final !! I feel Bahain/Qatar's poaching of athletes only action will be taken when it starts to affect the US/UK and Jamaica in the Olympics. Update - Shooting: Rahi Sarnobat bags **Gold** in WOmen's 25m Pistol Final.  Men and women both lose to Iran in kabadi.
Great rivalry coming up for years to come.  Tajinderpal Singh Toor has won the gold medal in men's shot put. His best throw was of 20.75 m , which is also a new Asian Games record. Great work by him. Hopefully we will get more medal from athletics in the coming days. 3 gold medals in running denied because of Bahrain/Qatar buying off athletes. Out of a total of 7 medal events in Athletics in which Indian athletes were participating today, they won medals in four events (1 gold and 3 silver). Quite an impressing performance indeed. Damn Neeraj Chopra's score is good enough for an Olympic medal Update: Indian Men's Kabaddi Team beats Thailand with a score of 49-30, make their way into semi-finals.  Events in which India can win medal on Day 5 (23/08/2018):

1. Artistic Gymnastics - Women's Vault

16. Swimming - Men's 200m Backstroke
17. Tennis - Women's Singles
18. Weightlifting - Men's 77kg [removed] Rohan Bopanna and Divij Sharan wins gold in Tennis Men's Doubles. I feel that if we consider the ""original"" Asians, the Indian athletes clearly dominate a lot of events.  The men's table tennis team have qualified for the semi-finals beating Japan by 3-1, also ensuring a medal in the process Pakistan has some grandpa playing against Achanta in TT Hima Das, you absolute beauty. 30m lead was way too much for the Africans to cover. Hockey and kabaddi both have been massively disappointing. Neeraj chopra taught himself the art of throwing a javelin by watching YouTube , reason why his throwing looks unconventional.  Later he had become world class under great coaches   Sindhu's biopic should be called Silver. Is Rajyavardhan Singh Rathore the first sports minister who is a former sportsperson ? Bc Asian record kyo keh rahe ho, call it African records. Events in which India can win medal on Day 13(31/08/2018):

A bronze at last. Yet India wasn't at full potential. Pakistan was breathing down our neck! Not a comprehensive win and lots to improve before world cup. But man, Harmanpreet is proving to be a great great player!  Narendar Grewal wins bronze in men's sanda 65kg. [Asian Games 2018: Indian rowers claim gold in quadruple sculls](https://www.thehindu.com/sport/other-sports/asian-games-2018-indian-rowers-claim-gold-in-quadruple-sculls/article24767931.ece?homepage=true) Compound Men Archery's team now in the finals. \^\_\^   


Except the last shot, Rajat Chauhan scored all 10's. We needed a 7 in the last one, he scored a comfortable 9. Great going, will surely catch the finals! We've got 4 medals in Athetics till now with 1 gold and 3 silver. That's an amazing achievement. There's still Neeraj Chopra. Hopefully he'll be able to get a gold for us.  88.06 Damn! Neeraj Chopra is the answer for decades long old wait for Olympic gold in athletics. We have lost the men's table tennis team semifinal to Korea. One more bronze for India. Good performance by Indian team to reach till the semis.  India are currently third in the medals tally for athletics. Only behind Bahrain and China. And already got more golds than in 2014. And maybe more medals to come. Very impressive. Gold in Heptathlon. Wow. Hopefully the women's hockey team will win the gold, thus helping us to reach 7th position in the medal tally.  Boria majumdar is hyperactive guy... zyada hi excited rehta hai... India women team win squash semis against fav malaysia... Now on to finals...good job deepika/chinappa... win a Gold Fck! Another gold in Bridge!! I'm dreaming? Best tally ever in all respects ü§ôüèæü§ôüèæ We can best hope for a bronze now from Ind vs Pak field hockey match. So we finally end our Asian Games campaign at 69 medals(highest ever) with 15 gold(equal to our highest ever), 24 silver(highest ever) and 30 bronze medals. Update - Tennis: Rohan Bopanna and Ankita Raina beat South Korea's Kim Nari and Jeamoon Lee in Mixed Doubles, make their way to quarter-finals.  Update - Wrestling: Divya Kakran has won the **Bronze Medal** in Women's Freestyle 96kg, beating Taipei's Chen Wenling by 10-0! 

 u/snicker33 good job with the updates.
Thanks  Update - Tennis: Medal confirmed for India as Ankita Raina wins quarterfinals in straight sets, clinches match 6-4 6-1. Heena Sidhu wins bronze in Women's 10m air pistol. Piss-poor performance by India's archery team and the weightlifting contingent. Also very disappointed by India's top male badminton players not being able to put up a decent performance. 

It's easier to win at Commonwealth Games where the competition isn't so severe but if you harbour dreams of winning a medal at the Olympics then you ought to win at the Asian Games at the least!

 Nirmla has also qualified alongside Hima Das for the final of Women's 400m. India: Korea :: 4:1.
Really good performance by our girls! Last quarter was a delight!  Hima Das wins silver. Gold lady was just too good. :/ Archery should have more points other than 10,9,8 system. Points in decimal as well for more accuracy.  As noone else seems to be doing it congrats to Sindhu for the silver, best ever achievement by an Indian badminton player at Asian games. Hima Das disqualified for False Start. Wtf, it's a nightmare!!  India has been truly robbed of 3 gold medals from the Bahrain brought athletes. 1st the 100m gold, then 400m and the 4x400m mixed relay. They aren't even indigenous Asians.  11 medals in athletics so far and none of them is a bronze. This says a lot about the performance of Indian athletics contingent. The have been very confident and have given their 100 percent in every event.  The gold and silver in men's 800m was miraculous and so was the silver in mixed relay.

Archery also ended on a positive note for India as we managed 2 silver medals.

Sindhu's silver was a historic moment. Waiting for her to bring gold very soon.

History was also created in Table Tennis as the bronze in men's team event was India's FIRST EVER medal of any kind in table tennis.

Kurash came as the surprise package of the day with India winning a silver and bronze in it. Getting a medal in an event dominated heavily by Uzbeks is no mean feat. Hopefully these medals will help in popularising this sport in the country.

‚Äã Man manjit singh! What a champ!! Did anyone see that heat? Expecting a gold from Seema Punia. Hopefully she repeats her performance from the last edition.  Is it just me or scoring in boxing seems way too suspicious and shady? Jinson Johnson wins gold, to go with his silver in 800m. Manjit ends fourth, started sprinting thoda late. India have overtaken their 2014 medal tally, both in terms of gold and no. of medals (:  Commentators constantly calling the Bahrain athletes as Ethiopian and Kenyan athletes üòÇ Damn what a run,Bahrain I think had 3 gold medallists,Hima Das's greatest moment so far at senior level. If we get 2 more gold medals then we will equal our record of maximum gold medals which was set in the first ever Asian Games in Delhi, 1951. Bros, sorry for this interjection. Seeing the number of sports fans here, can we please have a separate indian subreddit for sports?

I fear it may be flooded with Cricket. Assuming a few fans here would be interested, how to go about it? Our current tally of 23 silver medals is the most number of silver medals we have ever got in Asian Games. The second best is 19 silver medals in 1982 Delhi Asian Games. We  have reached 1000 comments  in this thread  one more record today So that's it? We end on 69? Bahrain and Qatar are participating in the wrong continental games.

Should be in the African one. Though find it amusing their athletes don't even murmur the national anthem üòÇ Update - Swimming: Indian team qualifies for men‚Äôs 4x100m freestyle relay Final.  Update - Wrestling: India‚Äôs Harpreet Singh wins his bout against Heageun Park of Korea 4-1. He now enters the quarters.

 PV Sindhu enters quarterfinal by beating Indonesia's Tunjung GM by two games to nil. A huge upset in Squash as Goshal, the top seed is defeated. Very disappointing. 

Not much hope in Athetics other than Mohammed Anas, Dutee Chand and Neeraj Chopra.

I think we will fall woefully shot of gold medals this time and even overall medal when compared to 2014. Hima Das has qualified for women's 400m final. Indian team has won silver in Equestrian Eventing Team. The Indian team consisted of  Rakesh Kumar, Ashish Malik, Jitender Singh and Fouaad Mirza. Saina Nehwal is into the semifinal of women's singles after defeating Ratchanok Intanon. Sony needs to get better commentators (the analysts are ok I guess)  ,these seem of the old Doordarshan quality,not expecting them to have in depth knowledge but should know at least the basic rules  /nuances of games India are good in,during archery the commentator thought games was over after 21 out of 24 shots,despite Korea clearly keeping on shooting,a few days back he was screaming how an Indian wrestler was amazing in his defence in last few minutes as he won the last point only for the referee to raise the opponents hand(didn‚Äôt stop him screaming though),another one assured us of a medal for reaching the sf (he went on to lose the repechage),boxing guy has no confidence to say who is winning though I guess he honestly doesn‚Äôt make an attempt . We won two Silver medals in Equestrian - one for a team event and another an individual one.

Not too many people follow the sport but it's a great a achievement nonetheless. India vs S.Korea in both Men's & Women's compound archery team final Dutee Chand silver ,lost by 0.02s Goving Lakshmanan who earlier won the bronze in 10000 m race has been disqualified because his foot touched inside the race track. Gonna be a very tough fight for both Saina and Sindhu. Sania has to gave the world number 1 and Sindhu has to play the world number 2. It's not gonna be easy! 

If the two end up beating their opponent, then it's richly deserving.

I have a feeling that Saina may do better than Sindhu. But let's hope both these wonderful women win.  A lot of athletics action is coming up from 5:10 PM. Also the quarterfinals of men's and women' team in table tennis. Dharun Ayyasamy has won the silver in men's 400m hurdles. Excellent run by him, especially in the last 50m to rob the Japanese of the silver. Sudha Singh has won the silver in women's 3000m steeplechase. She won the gold in the same event in 2014 Asian Games.  Neeraj Chopra, my man. Silver for India in women's compound archery team event after losing to South Korea in the final. 

Final score : Korea: 231 India: 228

Muskan Kirar and Madhumita Kumari failed to get their best shots as the match progressed. Although excellent shooting by Jyothi Surekha Vennam. Archery: Most bizarre rules I've ever seen. But they tried their best.  So so many Bahrain-Qatar wins in tracks. Asia doesn't even have that 5 year IOA rule. Fuck them. There was a guy who has his brother playing for Nigeria. Just read about Tejinder Pal Singh shot put gold winner . He switched from cricket to shot put. Cannot imagine that dude playing cricket now with that physique. Hima Das almost caused another disqualification with that obstruction. At this point might just call them Afro-Asian Games. The Chinese boxer was all over Vikas. But Vikas won the bout. Dutee Chand, another Silver. Damn, she is a superstar. Almost beat the ""imported"" Bahrain girl. I was severely depressed at Indian loss. I am an ardent hockey follower, and I knew Malaysia is a though but to crack. But it turned out to be reinforced concrete. It's so so disappointing.  5th straight gold in womens 4x400m. We have been winning this since 2002. Amazing! 3 medals in sailing for India today. 1 silver and 2 bronze. We have 62 medals now, 3 away from equalling our record of total medals of 65, made in 2010 Asian Games. Gcttirth gets demo bronze in hearthstone. I think we are in for another disappointment in hockey.  As squash doesn't seem to be covered I guess boxing final  is the last thing we have left to watch.(other than e sports). GOLD!  Anyone watched the hockey finals?!! What an absolute cracker of a match!! Update- Wrestling: Harpreet wins his bout against Sumi Masato 8-0, enters semis. Another medal assured for India. 

 Santosh Kumar wins bronze in Men's Sanda 56kg.

&#x200B; 15 year old Shardul Vihan wins silver in double trap shooting!  Indian hockey team defeats Japan by 8-0. Disappointing performance by India in Kabaddi and Badminton. India's future in shooting looks so good, lots of young stars are coming up. No one wants to play squash, I don't see any more stars coming up in squash after these four. Jinson Johnson bags gold in men‚Äôs 1500m  Multi medalists for India at 2018 Asian Games:
Hima Das(3), Md. Anas Yahiya(3), Jinson Johnson(2), Dutee Chand(2), Arokiarajiv(2), Dharin Ayyasamy(2), Fouaad Mirza(2), Sharath Achanta Kamal(2). Gnanasekaran though to Men's Table tennis round of 16. Had a good game against Indonesian. Today is going to be a historic day for India in its Asian Games history. Today we will surpass our previous best of a total of 65 medals at 2010 Asian Games. We can also equal our record of 15 gold medals of 1951 Asian Games today as we need only two more gold. Boxing and Sqaush is our best bet to get those two golds. And if we get three gold, then it will be our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold and total medals won. Great games for India. Thank you all for showing interest.  It was a great journey! 69, oh holy number! We have improved vastly and it would have been (it is technically) our best performance, if not for damned Bahrain and Qatar.  This was Sindhu's 5th final loss of the year...must be so frustrating to lose so many finals. I feel like she's been number 2 number 3 for the longest time and in that time a bunch of people have occupied the number 1 position and won something significant (Marin was number 1 for a while, Ratchanok was 1, Li Xuerui was 1 and now Asiad finals). I do hope she starts winning. 

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, I'm just an armchair critic who's sad at her loss and only hope that she goes up from here.  Update - Wushu: India‚Äôs Roshibina Devi Naorem has beaten Pakistan‚Äôs Mubashra in the Women‚Äôs Sanda 60kg quarter-finals.

 Events in which India can win medals at Day 4 (22 /08/2018):

The Iranian opponent also showed some great sportsman spirit. Gunneshwaran Prabhakaran gets bronze in Tennis men's singles. Update - Badminton: Saina Nehwal reaches quarter finals, defeating Indonesia's Fitriani.  Dipika Pallikal Karthik gets the bronze medal in Women's Squash after losing to Malaysia's Nicol Ann David. Fouaad Mirza has won the silver in Equestrian Eventing Individual. Women's compound archery team has reached the final after defeating Chinese Taipei. Finally some good new in archery for India. PV Sindhu is in the semi-final of badminton women's singles. Now 2 medals are assured in badminton for India. India need to win its tie against Iran, DPRK has already upset Japan in Group B, so if we finish 2nd behind China we would face DPRK in QFs. Update: Dutee Chand wins **silver medal** for India. Gold and Bronze medalists have difference of 0.03 seconds. What a race! Sudha singh on her way to Silver in Steeplechase.

Edit: Nope.

Double Edit: Yup. Neena Varakil is giving her everything in women's long jump to get the gold  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWfyPrlQrEo

Check out this video from 5 min onwards to know how hyperandrogenism is treated unfairly by Americans loaded IAAF. Dutee Chand fought her suspension in CAS and then came back to win like Caster Semenya. Am I mistaken in thinking CWG Delhi had good crowds than here in Indonesia especially the marquee sports of athletics arena being almost empty.

They were shooting superbly and totally deserved the gold medal.

PS: I have started to hate the Koreans as much those Iranians and bought off athletes üòÇüòÇ It is gold and for India in men's 800m !!!! Gold to Manjit Singh and silver to Jinson Johnson.

(3:00 pm)¬†Women's Tournament, Semifinal for 9-12 positions - India vs Hong Kong

(All times in Indian Standard Time)

 In the mixed relays, Hima ran her lap in the second lane for half the race, until she realized that there was no lane at all, and then switched to the first lane.

Dont think we would have got the gold anyway but would have been a much closer finish. Boxing: Amit Panghal is through to the semi-final and India are assured of a BRONZE medal. I have to say amateur boxing is not exciting to watch. You think this guy is winning even the commentators get it wrong , but the judges choose the other opponent. No live scoring till the end of the match. Gold for Arpinder Singh. Gold for Arpindar. Bravo! Finally we are in double digit golds Events in which India can win a medal at Day 12 (30/08/2018) :

6:30 p.m.:- Athletics [Finals - Men's 4*400 m. Relay Team and Women's 4*400 m. Relay Team] Women's 4 X 400m , Gold. Silver in men's 4 x 400m relay. A good race by the Indian athletes. Losing to those imported athletes is not a true loss in my opinion. The third lap was crucial in surpassing Japan. Also nice trigger in the last stretch. Neither any of the channels nor sonyliv are broadcasting the squash semis. Any place else? 

Edit : Women‚Äôs team are through to the final. Will either face Hong Kong or Japan Amit into finals of Boxing !  I am so pissed man. No television broadcast of squash final. Finally India's winning tons of medals in sports somewhere. Why do we do so well in the Asian games but struggle in the Olympics? Fuck those oil rich middle Eastern countries buying their way to the Athletics medals. BC...this is turning out to be choking day. We have lost almost all games today... archery 2 final losses, badminton final loss, TT semi loss, volleyball qf loss against pak...boxing started with loss in quarters for sonia... All hopes now for athletics it seems... Why wasn't the football team sent to the games? I read that it was because they were considered unlikely to win a medal. However, Vietnam, a team much behind India in the FIFA rankings, are in contention for bronze tomorrow. Even Pakistan and Bangladesh sent their teams. I don't really understand this decision, especially with the rapid traction football has been gaining lately.   Update - Gymnastics: Indian women team qualifies for the final, finishing 7th on the table. Update - Tennis: Prajnesh Gunneswaran beats South Korea's Kwon Soon-woo. A medal assured for India in Men's Singles.  Update - Squash: Dipika Pallikal beats Indonesia's Rohmah Yeni Siti 3-0 in women‚Äôs singles Round of 16.

‚Äã Compound Men's team reaches the semis! Man these games are all so nerve-wrecking. Seemed like an easy win, but two shots of 8 and they needed a 10 to win...and he did it. So exciting. Indian men's compound archery team is also in the semi-finals. Great display of marksmanship. The ending was a bit nervous for India after they lost their comfortable 3 points lead due to two 8 point shots. But the final shot of 10 points ensured India's win with the score of 227 against Philippines' 226.  India wins brone in Bridge men's team and mixed team events. Md. Anas Ahiya wins silver in Men's 400m Santosh Kumar Tamilrasan has qualified for final of 400m hurdles. Govindan L has lost his bronze as he has been disqualified. Vey sad incident.

 Saina Nehwal gets the bronze after losing to Tai Tzuying in the semi final. She played good till 14-15 points in both the games but lost her momentum after it. WHere can i watch mens table tennis? 

Ten sports, Sony, etc is all actively discussing Dutee Chands 100m in the studio for the 100th time today. SHow us the events, goddamit! PV Sindhu has lost the gold medal by playing probably her worst final ever. Loose shots and low confidence. She needs to come out of the mental block she faces while playing in the finals. Don't know why she starts looking quite ordinary in finals compared to the earlier matches in a tournament. We got a bad beating today. No gold. Guess hockey and athletics are the only hope.  Pincky Balhara gets the silver in Kurash !! Very good performance by her to reach till the final and get the silver Fck man! I hate bahrain ..importing atheletes from africa( powerhouse in running/atheletics) ..even in women's 5000m now .
Feel like they robbed india of so many golds :-/ Fck! Another imported gold for bahrain :-/ Mixed team track event looks fun. And yet again ...robbed of a gold by Bah-fc-rain! Volleyball me I think they have bought firangis from Europe or America. Manika Batra is hot! First Indian female medallist in the history of TT So are we winning any medals today apart from Athletics? We scored 76 goals in the tournament and still not in final ffs  We beat Bahrain in track. WOMEN WIN GOLD IN 4x400m. WHAT A RACE!  All throw events in women China won gold. 4 straight golds. These throw events we have a better chance than beating African imports who even the world's best cannot beat. What is India's best rank ever in Asian Games and when? Vikas out with an injury. Lots of news reporting that he won't play his semi final and will settle for the bronze. The cut he received above his eye in the previous match is impairing his vision.

She was very fast right from the beginning.  Jinson Johnson has qualified for the 800m final after winning the heat 1. Table Tennis Women's Team is Out in QF, they lost to Hong Kong 3-1. Hoping Men's Team can win their match. Singles will be even tougher. Indian women's TT team has lost in the quarterfinal to Hong Kong. Sindu lost first set. Fingers crossed. Hope it gets to third set. Wtf is up with sindhu? Sindhu settles for silver. She wasn't in rhythm today. Tai Tzu played phenomenal. Hats off. Badminton women's final: Happened what everyone on Reddit expected. Sindhu needs to work on her final-phobia. Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

  Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PKR) start ho gaya bhailog Boxing womens featherweight (57kg) quarterfinals 

Sonia Lather(IND) vs jo son hwa(PRK) 

  We lost PRK dominated all three bouts
 So looks like this is it..only hockey is gold prospect now? Or do we have more gold opportunities(Wrestling maybe?) Jinson Johnson comes in with the best time from the semis. Hope he runs the race of his life. I dont think an Indian guy won the Asiad gold in 800m since Charles Borromeo in 1982. Pinky Balhara and MY Jadhav has reached the semi finals in Kurash women's -52kg ensuring 2 bronze medals for India. Okay guys Women's heptathlon has resumed with shot put event. We are currently at number 1 and number 3 position. Dutee Chand has qualified for 200m final by winning the semifinal 1. Hopefully Hima Das will too. Hima Das has been disqualified. Wtf is happening in this race. Don't they give warning or anything? I don't know much about Kurash but one thing is sure that Uzbeks are too good in it. Pincky Balhara has reached the final in Kurash !! She has ensured a silver for the country. Great performance by the 19yo. Just came to know from the commentary that Kurash originated in Uzbekistan. Explain why the Uzbeks are so good in it. any idea why the athletics stadium is 75% empty? I thought the Asian Games is a premier event which would attract lotsa crowds.  most of the top asian athletes are competing. probably low level of interest in a country like Indonesia.  India wins silver in mixed 4x400m relay. Fuckin' African-Baharainins Is dutee chand's race left today? What events does India have a chance to win tomorrow?  Barman is first with only the 800 meters left and the second place athlete and her have identical personal bests in the 800 meters. Hembram is in 4th and probably more difficult for her to medal. Why can we let those Bahraini athletes participate? So we can buy medals now; then where's the sport I reckon. Where's the patriotism and sportsmanship?  Achanta/Manika - India's best ever in TT are up against North Korea in Mixed doubles QF. Win here will assure another historic medal in TT.  Watched yesterday's highlights.
What did happen in men compound archery team? We were almost at cusp of winning gold medal.

Neeraj Chopra is surely my star. Hoping for Olympic medal tbh. 

 Second table tennis medal confirmed in mixed doubles for the first time ever. This has been India's best games. At least a bronze for TT mixed team! Man it was a bp rising game.  TT SF : Achanta,Manika against two boys 10 golds bhai ..update the thread üòÅ The direct feed commentators are so much better than the Sony ones. They don't even bother to do basic research about scoring system of the events they are covering. India lose relay appeal and squash women's team are in the semis. This Salwa Naseer from Bahrain just ran 4x100m relay and boy she was lethal. Feel for the Chinese for losing their gold to them though.

It surprising that she runs 100m, 200m and 400m  Seema Punia settles for Bronze in Discuss Throw When did the Malaysian team get so good? I'm not a regular hockey follower, but I remember so many games of India mauling Malaysia. What a gold in Women's 4X400m relay for India. Simply superb. Mens relay is more difficult..fuck... JApan ka lambu is kickass runner... and bahrain aur qatar imports toh hai hi Where is the best place to watch all the highlights? Like the womens 4x400m relay? 2 more medals in sailing - one silver and one bronze Esports semifinals is on. Glad to see india in there. Any more Golds up for grabs? One more strong gold medal prospect remaining for India today : Sqaush How come there's 3 Korea on the medal table? Anybody?  [China's humble brag not enough space in newspapers for all medal winners](http://www.espn.in/espn/story/_/id/24489130/china-asian-games-where-gold-always-good-enough) Anyone else thinks that PV Sindhu loses her nerve in any tournament final? Silver in men's .Beaten By Africa. Qatar(Africa) wins the men's 4X400. India settles for silver. Ayaz taking a dig at Boria for not knowing about Sailing,Boria with his usual overconfidence (mis)calculated all medal prospects the other day and didn't even mention sailing. Love some good banter xD Roshibina Devi wins bronze in Women's Sanda 60kg. We've come a long way from the first Olympic gold. The next olympics will definitely be the best so far Bridge mens pair gold.   

edit. so we match 15 golds. Armchair critics doing their work here it seems.
We did well this Asian games,last time was really disappointing, winning or losing is just a part of it. I don't see anyone complaining when we beat the Africans in women's 4x400 relay,which was a huge upset. Why complain now? Our women's hockey team in particular had a great game, we should appreciate it not demean them.
Only disappointment for me was men's badminton and our kabaddi performance,even there , people who had seen the last Asiad final between india and iran men's, should know that it was on the cards.

Tl;dr : a great Asian Games for india and we should be proud of our athletes.

 That shooting match in which Rajput won the silver, it was intense  [deleted] [deleted] Did India not qualify for the football event. Are they so bad in Asia too? Ankita Raina wins bronze in Tennis Women's Singles. 4 point lead for iran. 14 minutes remain. will be a massive shock if we lose. ajay thakur is all bloody and not likely to play anymore  5 point lead, 5 minutes to go. come on guys!! Olympics mein to hai hee nahi ab our one confirmed gold in the asian games is being taken away :( Update - Squash: Joshna Chinappa settles for **Bronze** after losing in the women‚Äôs semi-finals to Malaysia's Sivasangari Subramaniam.

 Update - Handball: The Indian women‚Äôs handball team defeat Malaysia 54-19 in their Classification 9th-10th Place match. Dutee Chand match link? Anyone. Please. Is there a 100m sprint? Wanna see who the fastest in Asia is. What is the progress in Womens Decathalon...last i saw barman was leading...this was after the high jump...any more updates...can't watch... India vs Pakistan in Volleyball. India is leading by 1 set to nil. It is a quarterfinal for 7-12. Men's archery team is playing at God Level. 6 out of 6 perfect 10s. Indian Archers are killing it!!

may defeat the world champions korea! Haha it's tied again.  Looks like players from other sports have left it to athletics to bring the gold medals in the seond half of this Asian Games. Swapna Barman is such a fighter. Giving her PB in shot put with a facial injury.  Tf is happwning!! Yaqoob Yaqoob. The name so nice you say it twice. A bronze and an assured silver in Kurash. Very proud moment for the athletes and the country. Mallaprabha Jadhav has won the bronze medal in Kurash. Why do Qatar and Bahrain care about medals anyway? Indian athletes in 20km walk disqualified ? Anyone know the reason ? swapna barman just threw her lifetime best over 50 meters in the javelin. She is back in the lead in the heptathlon. Crucial boxing QFs have begun... 4 Indians are in fray. Boxing has been most disappointing so far with zero medals. Why were male boxers bout without head protection but female is with ? Right, so athletic events of the day has begun... medal hopefuls - Arpindar in Triple Jump, Swapna Barman in Heptathlon, Dutee in 200m and qualifications of Manjit, Johnson in 1500 finals and Indian team in 4x400 relay...
There is also Womens hockey semi and boxer Dheeraj in QF coming up... more medal hopefuls Wasnt indian women's hockey at 4:30 today?
 Dutee Chand another silver(200m). Another silver in womens 200m thanks to Bahrain Thankfully we won 2 medals in boxing today in last leg. Hopefully they will turn it into Gold to save some face. Like Kabaddi, another disappointment this year. 
2014 - 5,
2010 - 9 Arpinder Singh is leading in men's triple jump. Uhh what? No manjit and johnson both are there 1 medal away from equaling 2014 medal tally Any events remaining for the day for India besides hockey ? Bronze in Women‚Äôs 1500m Lost to Malaysia in semi final during shoot out 6-7, Hockey men's. India lose the hockey semi-final similar story against Australia they are terrible in these shootouts. Lost to Malaysia in Men's Hockey. I was hoping for the India Pakistan final. :( Malaysia deserved to win they kept their heads throughout,going down to 9 men while ahead was utter nonsense,having said this  I don‚Äôt understand how was our first penalty even close to an obstruction. Any hope for any more gold medals? Boxing or Womens Squash? And yeah women's hockey! Bahrain won a gold + silver in 2016 olympics. Next games definitely they can get 7+ medals. Manika not able to pick the back spin of the boy. We are trailing 0 -1 in squash women's team final. Anyone know when is the final football match? I love how a lot of medals have come from athletics off late! Do you think it's because of improvement in training facilities over the last 2-3 years?  I don't know why Indian women's team is so dumb. This was a simple dumb play. Either we are dumb, or Japanese are very smart. Wasting 6 minutes allowing Japan to dribble the puck as much as they like when you are 1 goal down in the final quarter. Wow! Come on! What do you have to lose by attacking when you are 1 goal down! Yet India defended like crazy. Japan outplayed us. I am disappointed cause present Indian team has more potential. Both guys and girls. 

So no gold from hockey, yet again. I expected 2 golds considering their form and skill.  Just saw the compound women archery QF(?). What a game! They were trailing by 3 points and just before the last round it was all tied somehow. Three shots left and India got 10 on each shot! Really fun to watch.

Edit : It was the SF! They are into the finals!

That is quite a leap even for home games. What do you think is the reason ? There is clearly a gulf between Tai and other current women players. Sindhu has got more power in her smashes because of her larger stature but she isn't swift off her feet. She couldn't pick many of the drop shots she should have India out of boxing without a medal. But seriously man empty stadiums are so disappointing..can only imagine what thr atheletes must feel like :-( Op, now we are 8th. Update it please. our Table Tennis campaign ends with 2 bronze,great improvement in a world class field,Men's team and specifically Achantha did very well,room for little improvement in women's section.
All in all ,a great outing. One more gold and this will become our best ever Asian Games in terms of gold as well as overall medals. North Korea has more medals than INDIA. FTW. Man i cant get over the fact that if bahrain hadnt cheated us of golds we'd be number 5 ahead of iran at like 20 golds Gold done and dusted for the archery team  Do you need different body types for discus/hammer/shotput throw ? Never see athletes competing in both events. In swimming and track so many athletes do multiple events. Does anybody know how strong are Bahrain in women's 4x400 relay. If not for them, that's a strong gold prospect for us tomorrow. [deleted] when is manu bhaker's final?  Congratulations Anyway to watch the India v Iran Semi-Final Kabaddi match online?

 Archery game is on, at halfway point India and Korea are just one point apart.

Lmao that chutiya from philipine didnt even know how to do the eye celebration. How many more events in hepthathalon? We are 1 medal away from 50 medals. What's the next even for India? China has won 6 gold medals in throw and jump events. 4 in women's events which is much easier. When is the men's final for 1500? WTF...women hepthatlon 800m is divided into 2 heats? this is confusing...our players are in 2nd race Why is Vikas Gowda not competing?  [deleted] Girls are not really playing well in hockey semi. We gotta win this, cmon yaar. Need 2 golds in hockey. 
 Hockey semi in the shootouts, 1-1. Other than 5000m any event left for India? Anyone knows where can I watch Sharath Kamal‚Äôs round of 16? 

Edit : He lost the round of 16.  How's india men's squash semis looking? Now I know why people were pissed after France won the FIFA World Cup We need to target field events in high jump,long jump,triple jump,pole vault and throwing events to win gold medals. Difficult to beat powerhouses \s like Bahrain and Qatar in track  Hoping Manika Batra defeats all the boys to a medal. Why the fuck is this thread not stickied?

Edit: Someone stickied it now. Thankfully. And with kazak gold india gets pushed down further :-/ ALL EXCITED FOR 11:40AM GAME. Come on Sindhuuuuuuuu!!‚ù§Ô∏è Damn! That bahrainian chic was HOT!! no 4 x 100 teams for India?

also nobody in 100, 200m for men? [deleted] [deleted] [Hong Kong Goalie](https://en.asiangames2018.id/athletes/athlete/CHAN-Hou-Fung-3027041/)

Ramu, 32, a spectator from Soriampatti in Pudukottai district, and G. Sathish, 35, of Allur in Tiruchi, believed to be a bull owner, succumbed to injuries near the collection point.  The entire Tamil Nadu defied the Supreme Court and silently protested on the streets couple of years ago for this moment. ü•Çüéâüéä Rookie numbers, gotta pump those numbers up.

A better sport would be that many bulls versus one human force fed alcohol and tortured before being let out into the arena. These people will never come to their senses. Till there is money and politics involved it will always be like this. The media will be involved in propaganda that this is essential for income of the farmer and also for breeding of the cows.  Jalaibuddhu üòÇ Look at all the arm chair critiques here putting down farming community with their elitist mindset. 

If farmers wanted this happen so badly, let them have at it. You all don't care for that animal more than the ones nurturing them. 

And whenever incidents like this pops up, time to bring the pitch forks out. There are hundreds of events happening during Pongal season and there are always some morons who do stupid stuff.

Any quick suggestions, ideas are much appreciated.",tifosi7," It was a boon for me. Except the 3 or 4 sports channels, English News and Entertainment channels, I removed everything. Bill is about 20% of previous bill. Most of my media consumption is on Prime video and Netflix anyway.  It's been 3-4 months since my family stopped using TataSky. We have a smart TV, we're using Hotstar annual sports (299), Sony Liv annual (499, can also be paid using Google play credits earned through their rewards programmes), prime videos (free with Airtel postpaid's entry plan, also with Airtel broadband's medium plan), Netflix UHD (Sharing with friends @200 pm).

Mom: Watches movies on prime videos, Netflix, YouTube (nice collection of old Hindi films available for free) and some shows on Liv

Dad: Watches sports on Hotstar and Liv, news on YouTube and Hotstar. Movies across all.

Me: Mostly Netflix and prime video.

Bill = ~260 pm (little more than half of TataSky)

P.S. broadband prices are same as two years back, the FUP limit and speed has drastically improved. I wonder what'll happen once jio disrupts fiber space. If it wasn't for my Parents and their dumb serials, I would cut the cable and switch completely to streaming.  Just go for the service provider who is most prevalent in your area.

Father a rickshaw puller, mother working in a tea garden, running for her country in the final event of the Heptathlon with a bandaged jaw. And winning it for India This country certainly has no shortage of heroines",3541,9bfq9y,https://i.redd.it/rllf8nsa65j11.jpg,158,,boredmonk," Can't wait for Bollywood to make her biopic with Sonam Kapoor in the lead and fucking it up completely.  Source: Joy Bhattacharya on twitter. Fucking great. I was also born with twelve toes. This is where our similarities end.  Dayyyyum. Her arms are better than mine.  I am glad that non cricket sports are getting more and more female role models. One of india's biggest core problem is the gender gap in employment and this would encourage closing it.  I can't handle this. This is amazing... I saw a picture of a text book in West Bengal depicting Milkha Singh as Farhan Akhtar from Bhaag Milkha.
Times are changing in India. But they are too ducking slow. Time to honour the real heroes and patriots.
And stop helping Bollywood in creating utterly crap movies. For Ex: Sultan

Sultan doesn't show any training. Just that he falls in love and those athletes who are busting their ass since they were probably 5 yrs old are all defeated in 6 months? Dafuk?  Now I feel shitty for complaining about waking up and still being tired.. Truly inspiring.  Can we somehow donate to her or her family? What's her UPI id? [This dude too](https://youtu.be/XaEGDS_curQ?t=3m5s). I was laughing at his rather unconventional throwing stances but he ended up demolishing his competition and won gold for India. Dude is like the Hulk.  Perfect example for ""what's your excuse?"" Might be mistaken but I think her name is Swapna Barman not Burman. 

Apparently the tape was used to help with a toothache in and infected tooth that flared up at the start of the competition. It was decided to try antibiotics rather than removing the tooth mid competition.  Look at that face. Look at that body language.

Iron clad determination!  How I see it is that India does not deserve such heroines when it cannot feed them or at least provide them with the infrastructure. It is ironic to say the least and very sad that to achieve basic standard of living is a quest for the common man in India. A hero the country needs right now, but not the one it deserves I think that is not inspiring but opposite of it. Telling everyone how our country doesn't care about any sports person no matter how badly they need help or caring intervention.. Our country sux. We all should be ashamed of ourselves.. This and many such truths just points to sorry conditions and diminishes all hopes for youth aspiring to excel in sports. OP , Hero should be gender neutral.
She is my Hero. India can't afford spl shoes for her? Poor country? But can afford to send her to Jakarta ? How? Congrats Swapna Burman for her great achievement even in a time when she was in great pain  first thing I see on reddit today - immediate goose bumps. well done. Very well done. No offence, but i legit thought that bandage was some sort of  Flag. Am i the only person who read the last word as heroine? I know this isn't the point and I am happy for her achievement and what it means for our nation, but she is really hot. Those arms! * swoon * Now that's a role model girls should be looking up to. Not fucking Karina Kaif and shit. India has enough money to feed an army of incompetent bureaucrats and politician-cronies to plum sports offices with first class international travel etc., but ACTUAL sportspeople and their families will live in poverty. The Sports Ministry expects impoverished people to win medals on their own grit, claims credit for when they actually do, and then goes back to its sarkari routine of incompetence, apathy, and neglect of actual sport.  If only we could treat our sportsman/ woman as we treat our cows, we could we winning Olympic medals by boatloads but knowing our government and its cronies hey would rather apply to make COW Safety a Olympics game rather. Daughters of India are making us proud big time. Hope they get good recognition and awards for their sacrifice None of the other nations are that surprised that women from India can run really fast. Hail mother india !! ‚õπÔ∏èü§ºüèäüö¥ü§æÔ∏è This is the story of the entire Indian economy.  The Indian Government fucking people in the ass till they can barely walk, and then the people persevering and triumphing somehow, and then the Minister arrives and places a garland on them and puts articles in the paper so the country looks good.  


If you want to know how full of behanchods the government is, just see how the sports bureaucrats travel and their baggage allowance, and then see how the athletes travel and their allowance.  


Or if you want to feel your gut wrench at the limits of disgust, examine how the sports budget is spent in terms of funds and facilities for athletes versus salaries, benefits, offices, and allowances for the bureaucrats.  


Every time an injured veteran is working some menial job to make ends meet or an athlete is begging around town for sponsors just to get fresh fruits and meat for their diet, Indians should protest.  Because, believe me, Indian Government has allocated enough funds to develop sportsmen and sportswomen in India ... but those funds are being used to employ and benefit behanchods in the bureaucracy instead. Sometimes I feel the country doesn't deserve her. Talents like her are nurtured and groomed in other countries. I know I shouldn't be complaining and working towards it. I normally do. Today is not that kind of day. Pardon me. Proud of her. Feminism aside... Why is her face held together by tape?  Big deal! Hritihk Roshan has 2 thumbs in one hand and still managed to do that dance step! She's an Inspiration for future athletes. My girl!‚ù§Ô∏è you go gurl Amazing ! She is real heroine of India.she inspire all people of India for her work. Wish if I could give you a gold for title No shortage of heroin  
FIFY Watching her mom's reaction to seeing her win, I cried.

I hope Swapna gets some brand endorsements, her story is incredible.  We don't deserve her.  Fuck yeah, this woman probably works harder than any of us can begin to comprehend Where can I see her actual performance? I can‚Äôt believe the amount of spam videos with slideshows when i google her name!  India doesn't deserve such relentless sportspersons. Sad but true. This should be before she got to Indian team. Typical of Bollywood, let some unknown win some shit and then the Bollywood vultures circle around to make monies and ride to fame Correct me if I am wrong but I've noticed that all of Indian sportspersons are either from quite wealthy families or from very poor families like in this case. The salaried middle class never produces top class athletes. What can be the reason behind this? Jai hind  And I still wonder why Indian women are demanding equality when they are so much better than us Whats the difference in havigg six toes? Damn straight there‚Äôs no shortage heroine She was designated runner of India  This. Is what true feminism is.

And overall Channel cost being higher than previous scheme.

But what if we don't watch TV at all and encourage others  because We All Know They are selling propaganda afterall. Every channel has their own agenda.There is not a single quality '30 minute programme.' I might be exaggerating but I can say this for about 80% of TV.

I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs  online for a very low fees. 

These are my 2 cents on the situation about how we can tackle it.
I know my fellow redditors will have questions. I will try to answer their questions.
",UnhatchedEgg," \+1

It's for this reason I haven't watched a news show I think since the Nirbhay movement. Everything is measured by TRP and clicks, not by good outcomes for everyone.  Cut my cable back in Jan last year and got a Chromecast..its much better.. planning to get a mi box as it has more features While we ourselves may not watch Tv,  there are still millions whose only source of entertainment is the tv. 

My grandma would kill me if I take the tv away from her.  >I understand people still want to watch sports and news. We can watch these programs online for a very low fees.

Not everyone has access to unlimited high-speed internet. I live in a tier 2 city and I am finding it hard to give up on DTH and solely rely on the internet for streaming. Now think about those who are living in rural or remote areas or are not technologically savvy enough. It is not as easy as you are making it out.  6 years + here. Got feed up with mindless ads and 3rd class content. I do have all channels cause wife and mom. But me personally, I don't even know what to watch on TV lol. Used to be interested in news but there's nothing left there. 

So when I have absolutely nothing to do and I am tired of Netflix, YouTube, amazon prime, reddit... I turn on the TV, keep changing the channels for about 2 minutes and turn it off  Stopped watching. The most peaceful 1.5 yrs. Cable connection in my home is just for my grandma's shows. Okay some are saying they use Cable only because of their families. That's alright in my opinion. 
But atleast we can encourage our generation and younger generation who think they've got no other source of entertainment. Had been more than a year that I got rid of TV... Don't even own one now...have got so much free time now that I spend on improving myself. Where can we watch sports online for low fee? Amazon Prime Video ‚Çπ999

Hotstar Annual Sub    ‚Çπ999

Netflix(4 Person)         ‚Çπ200

SonyLiv                          Free

Much better than any cable pack you might subscribe to.  I haven't had a cable connection since 2014. Never missed it for a minute  I don't watch TV at all since school days. We were in boarding school and had no tv. College days there was no time. These days whole of the entertainment is online. I made the mistake of opening tv few times, what a bunch of crap that passes for a news, tv serial, reality shows etc, utter crap. The crap that we have on Indian tv will fall flat in front of any cable content from other countries. About time they think through how to make serials, news , reality shows, etc because newer generation of people simply aren't interested in watching TV at all. It's all about internet. Simple YouTube channels and news articles on the internet have better content than big media houses. And then comes these Netflix, Amazon prime, hulu type services that produces awesome content that people actually pay to see and can see it anytime any episode anywhere.  Wish I could tell this to my parents but TV is the only thing they have for entertainment so I really don't wanna screw with that [removed] [removed] I dont even watch TV since 3-4 years.Its my grandparents who are TV fanatics. Someone please explain that to my mum and dad who keep the effing TV and that set-top-box for absolutely no reason. Redditors please put forth your points to aid me I haven't watched actual TV in over 15 years.. ever since I left home for college. Couldn't really watch in college, and after I left college, I stuck to movies and TV shows from the internet. 

I tried watching a few times but was astounded by the sheer number of ads. Also, the fact that you have essentially a very limited choice at any given moment, and you have to wait for the show you want is too bad. I'm surprised TV has lasted so long. Maybe it's there for the older people and for news and sports. ",2019-02-02 11:15:37

> ""I've been to India before to a race which was strange because India was such a poor place yet we had this massive, beautiful grand prix track made in the middle of nowhere. I felt very conflicted when I went to that grand prix. can't wait for Indians to en masse abuse and downrate Levi strauss   Why such clickbaity titles.  He is not wrong, the track is way out of Delhi and not many people are even interested in paying so much to watch F1 race. The headline is so misleading smh. He is speaking the truth. Don't see anything wrong with his statement. 1 star to Lewis Hamilton in F1 2018 That poor image helps Hollywood directors get a Oscar. He's right. Not only is India poor but it has no racing tradition of the F1 variety. It's wholly imported, just like everything else. Really glad to see some sense being spoken for a change. When she says 'I want you to go away' but you only hear 'I want you '. I kinda wish we taught people a crash course on inequality and diplomacy. Hosting things like this is part of a country‚Äôs soft power export. 
When 2008 Beijing olympics happened, China wasn‚Äôt as powerful as it is today and a lot of its population was poor. Even if only 1% of a country is interested in things like this, that‚Äôs a whooping 14 million people for countries like China and India. 
As much as people want to think otherwise, all governments in the world care more about the rich and upper middle class who are interested in stuff like F1 Races. The voice of common Joe isn‚Äôt heard unless he have money.  BWOAH! Wait till he goes to Vietnam. Raikkonen Zindabad! Bsdk levis 

‚≠êüî≥üî≥üî≥üî≥ Only if the stupid policies hasn't put an end to the GP, its such a shame when you think of it. Guys, should we tell him about the statue? How dare he sat that? We are rich enough to waste half a billion dollars on an ugly ass statue out in the middle of nowhere just to score a few political points.  This is going to be an unpopular opinion because I know there are a lot of Hamilton and F1 fans in India (/s) and a lot of India-bashers. But here's what I have to say:

To me, whenever a westerner calls India poor, it evokes the same feeling like a thief calling you poor after robbing your house. The western education conveniently distorts world history and doesn't account for the centuries of loot that they are still feeding on. They built Suez Canal precisely to loot India and had thousands of huge ships taking away India's wealth into England. In fact, their media constantly talks about India's poverty to subconsciously (or consciously) justify the endeavors of their forefathers in India. Even Indian history books don't talk anything about the quantum of this loot, which creates a self-bashing brigade. 

Alright, this excuse has been overused, but it doesn't make it any less of a fact. 

Today, the rate at which India is growing, you'll see lots of westerners standing in the Indian work-permit lines within a decade. The tables are going to turn again. A lot of these ignorant tarts will need to reflect on what they said a decade ago.

I am 19 and I look like a fat child with a visible low self esteem and confidence. People keep throwing me around like a ball, insulting me to my face.

I decided to get thin. Went to a gym and was told membership is 6k for 3 months. I tried bargaining but I just suck. I don't want to ever bargain. It feels cheap but in India is necessary to do so. I thought to myself maybe the place has a strict no bargain policy. Cool, so I get it.

My friend joins the gym a month later for the same 3 months but pays 5.5. I ask the asshole receptionist to which she says ""sirf 500 toh kam kiya hai""... This is the same person who refused a discount of 100.

Trainers tell me to buy MuscleBlaze (they have a poster there for advertising) from them. They tell me it's as good as Optimum Nutrition. I didn't fall for that shit, place is scummy as fuck.

I can do legs well but upper body is really hard for me. I usually do 10 lbs and get down to 5 after a set or two. Often I see people smiling/laughing at me from a distance while I do it.

Go to therapy they said. 5 years and 1L in medicines and doctor's fees and things keep getting worse. I don't know how long I can keep this going.

I need help.",royal_rocker2," Find another gym or another activity (sport/swim/walk/dance/garden etc). Gyming is not for everyone and its not in the gym's interest to tell you that.

Tell them in a neutral tone, they aren't treating you right and providing a healthy environment. See what they say. If they decide to address the issues genuinely give them another shot.

If they act smart ask for a refund or you will be posting a review on Google/FB etc about the bad experience you had. Keep your messaging simple and don't start abusing, raise voice etc. Don't talk to underlings. Talk to the boss.

Think of this as a learning experience in handling these kind of issues. One or two times you handle these kind of situations, confidence will start coming back. i hate bargaining too. it's demeaning. [deleted] Brother, don‚Äôt ever think of that 6k as a poor investment. But as life nag as you get out out what you intended to , 6k is a very small place to pay. Commit to a workout , whether it‚Äôs weight, cardio, classes. Just be all in if you want something. Fitness doesn‚Äôt just give you a good body it gives you a whole lot more than that. I am a sports scientist, so believe me when I say that 6k is not more. People usually pay 25¬£ just to consult with me for their training program or even a training session for exercise or posture correction. As long you do exercises correctly and progress to lifting more you ll be good. Cheers r/getMotivated One thing I have learnt the hard way is that most of the things that we have are problem with or we are afraid of are in our mind. Our minds make things so much more complicated. I was diagnosed with Hypo-thyroid and I put on weight massively, which mean I was looking much less nicer than I did earlier. I developed inferior complexity of people making fun of me, having opinions about how I looked, to an extent that some people who were my friends were not willing to include me in any activity we did otherwise anymore. I was devastated.

Eventually, I realized whether you are short or tall, skinny or obese, people will look at you and make fun of you. You can't change that and no one will ever give a damn. What matters is that you chose to make a difference and work towards making yourself healthy. If you're not comfortable in the current gym, find another. When you begin talking about the costs, tell them that people have highly recommended the gym and you expect a concession. Be confident, people will look but if you're confident about yourself, they will look in awe too. Keep your vibe high. Wear things you like as long as they aren't over the board. You're beautiful, others don't have to tell you that, you should know that yourself.

Please keep discussion civil.

Another question : what were negative aspects of the Islamic invasion of India ?

",28mumbai," Upvoted for visibility. Maybe also post in /r/AskHistorians  Food - A new mix of flavors A huge amount of positive influence to Hindustani music definitely. Amir Khusrow has had probably the single greatest influence on Indian classical music of any person.

 Food, music, architecture & language...Urdu is the finest example...Amazingly beautiful language...

>what were negative aspects of the Islamic invasion of India?

Islamic invaders went a few step beyond greek invaders...they destroyed temples , religious & educational institutions, they forced conversions literally & by deceiving & by luring with financial gains...There were moderate Muslim rulers like Akbar (Which I agree is suspicious)...some say that if Dara Shikoh was not killed by Aurangzeb, India would have been a different place right now. Poetry,Urdu,food,architecture and design,first set of roads,pigeon telegrams,jagirdari was abolished in some areas,established, developed and fortified hyderabad and delhi as a state of wealth and power,introduced jizya and zakat to elevate the poor.

Negative - Forced conversions in some places - jizya was exclusive to non muslims,internal fueds which killed a lot of people,wiped out most of the rajputs

This is from a debate i had in school...vaguely remember some of the stuff now. From an earlier post - (old thread removed). /u/piacious

>good: food like biryani, kebab,samosa et all. music like sufi genre, architecture, literature . social system changed for better for a bit .

>bad: usurped land and forced conversions of natives. looting of all the treasure and destruction of pride of natives. philosophical debates took a hit. much confidence has been lost since.


 Violence and Intolerance. Nothing. Babaji ka thullu Lot of positive things. Land records are even today maintained using persian/muslim system. Even in south india, which saw less muslim rule. The official language of administration of even sikh emperor ranjeet singh was persian.

Notice how ""muslim"" portraits of hindu kings like shivaji look? Thats cultural influence.

Lots more that are not well known. Purda is obvious, but thats more negative.

I have strong aptitude for graphic design, having freelanced for quite some time. However, like all Indian parents, my parents want me to do an Mtech, that too in Civil. The problem with that is that Civil is a relatively low paying job for a very long time. I have an offer from a startup which pays higher than the current engagement, but since neither is core, my parents aren't very supportive. I have decent aptitude for marketing too, and was looking at a marketing MBA I am looking at three vastly different fields RN, Graphic design, MBA, Mtech in Civil. Pls advice",Bikihuigormint," I honestly don't understand how forcing a child to do what you think has more money, will make the child happy?

From my experience, I will say that please, only do a Masters in something, if you're genuinely interested and motivated to pursue that subject. You don't just go to an institute, get a degree and then are inundated with buttloads of money. It's hard work. You are developing a finer specialization in a field. And if you're are genuinely not motivated, it can end terribly.

The most important thing right now for you, I think, is to carefully think which profession you want to get in. Money is an important criterion, but I think the 3 fields you mention, they all pay well and sufficient for you to live comfortably. The most crucial question is: what work do you enjoy? What do you see yourself doing for years, day in and day out? Sometimes you will be thinking about work during your free time. Which of those 3, Graphic Design, MBA and Civil, do you see yourself giving your all? Something that you can work on, for hours and hours?

My background: I went into engineering, against my father's wishes. He wanted me to go into medical, and I sucked in that. You can imagine the drama that ensued because of my decision. He was threatening to disown me. The whole Indian TV soap drama.

Then I went abroad for Masters in Theoretical Physics. This was something that developed gradually. I kept asking ""why?"" to engineering questions, delved deeper and deeper, and got hooked on Modern Physics. I naturally wanted to do a PhD, and got a scholarship for that. Now I have a good job abroad. It's not all rainbows and roses. Some days are really damn hard and it's a pain to get through the work. But at the end of the day, I am still grateful I took this path, made my own decisions, and live the consequences.

This is your life. You are the one who will actually have to do the work. Your parents/uncles/aunties/friends *might* think that this is better for you or that. But you are the one who has to live your entire life on those decisions. Why not make an informed, well-thought one? Understand the future prospects of those professions, what you want with your life, and which one aligns the most closely with your ambition and desires. Best of luck, OP.",2017-04-10 18:41:39

In light of the upcoming coverage of the election results (both real and exit) we believe the following would be the best way to cover these elections at /r/India:

* On the evening of the 12th (5pm IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the results of the various exit polls. 

* On the morning of the 16th (8am IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the actual results of the elections. This thread would contain the link to two separate threads - one for the results of the Lok Sabha and one for the results of the state legislatures that are going to poll. 

These threads (the exit poll thread, and the thread for results of state elections and lok sabha elections) would be created by /u/megathreadbot (same bot which helped us out in covering the assembly election results in December 2013). Any user would be able to add updates to the body of the text post. 

The threads would be [R]eddiquette enforced and no name calling / personal abuses will be tolerated. All news items related to the election results should go in these threads. Please don't create separate threads for them. This will help in consolidating the discussion in a single thread. 
",rahulthewall," Can we attempt a new experiment?
Anything that is even remotely abusive or gets into name calling...delete that post outright. No warning nothing. /r/askhistorians level cleanliness. In that case we need a parallel sticky thread on /r/bakchodi dedicated for name-calling and uncivil debate.. Any sane comment should be immediately deleted and the user suspended..  Can we have a live thread/chatroom too for unadulterated shit-flinging and name-calling? Can we have the upvote and downvoted sign as the Congress' hand?! That'd be fun for a few days. [deleted] Excellent. This would prevent the flood of posts on the result day.

Please remove posts appearing multiple times, or else other posts will get buried. What's an election thread without name calling / personal abuse?  Better make 5 threads, one each for North, west east south and central India. Just throwing in suggestion. We need a SLEDGE thread a day before along the lines of /r/Cricket  A page created by Bing tracking election results: http://www.bing.com/elections

Share this also if needed. >On the evening of the 12th (5pm IST) we would create a sticky thread for covering the results of the various exit polls

its 5:25 where is the thread????? Can we have a dedicated Sledge thread....Anyone who wants to be abusive or  have some fun, can go here :)

I thing this will make things easier for everyone. Basically we are giving everyone what they want.

Have a link to this thread on top next to the reddiquette message  Anyone interested in charitable bets like /r/CharitableBets but for election results?

Like you could bet on range of seats of a party or the winner of a particular seat etc? Election Result will be available live on 16th May @ http://www.recruitmentvartha.com > The threads would be [R]eddiquette enforced and no name calling / personal abuses will be tolerated.

---

Hey /r/India,  
**Rahul Yadav** has agreed for an AMA session with us. He's been in the headlines quite a lot recently, and has even been coined as the ""*monk who sold his Ferrari*"" by a [few media outlets](http://www.firstpost.com/business/rahul-yadav-really-monk-sold-ferrari-decoding-housing-com-ceos-rs-200-cr-gift-employees-2243666.html).  

So get your questions ready and let's have an interesting AMA here on /r/india. Please keep in mind that it will be [R]eddiquette enforced so we will be moderating to ensure civility. 

**Bio:**

>Rahul hails from Alwar, Rajasthan where he received his primary education. He later went to IIT Bombay for higher studies, where he created a question bank from old exam papers to build the popular Exambaba.com. Exambaba was made the official IIT-B archive before eventually being shut down. After a brief internship in Israel, Yadav returned to build apps for Google Chrome. And then, in his final year, dropped out of IIT. Later, he joined his friends to co-found Housing.com.

**Date & Time:** May 19^th, Tuesday, 6PM IST.

**Verification**: http://i.imgur.com/T9uPJow.jpg
",AwkwardDev," I just hope he completely attends the AMA and not leave if he find us 'intellectually incapable' of conducting a good AMA! :P  Ooh this should be very very interesting! 

I'll have a bunch of nice questions ready. 


Also, prepare to see a deluge of journalists here now. He's hot topic in the press right now  I bet Deepinder Goyal will be watching over this to see how bad Rahul fucks this up. *grabs popcorn* Yaar this ama will be awesome but this will attract whole bunch of chu media :( THIS IS GOING TO BE SO MUCH FUN ! *goes and giggles in the corner like a black and white movie monster* Will be hard pressed to ask him about middlemen businesses vs creating real tangible value in a country like India I am a Corporate Governance researcher, and I find Rahul Yadav's announcements very interesting and disturbing at the same time. I will be very interested in knowing his thoughts behind:

1. How does he plan to have incentives aligned with success of Housing.com/convince investors that he is motivated, after giving away all his equity to employees. 

2. Is there a grey market for Housing.com shares. How can employees monetize the gift?

3. Isn't there regulation in India, that constrain private firms to have less than 50 investors, before becoming public. In that case, how can the shares be transferred to employees?

4. I have tracked Zillow/Trulia for a while. These firms have mapped a larger geography, and onboarded about a 100,000 agents to pay for ads connected to Zip codes. Still they are struggling with their bottomline, agent retention and agent up selling (They treat agents as their revenue sources, not end use customer). If Housing.com will be following a similar model, is it having success in onboarding agents? Is it having trouble with the unorganized/informal nature of real estate agents? What is being done to mitigate it?

5. Are the online only flash sales of apartments generating any revenue at all? Is it a sustainable model for the future?

6. What happened behind the scenes and how were the board members pacified to retain the CEO? How did men with big egos and the cash to boost, look beyond the tantrums to come to a rational decision? Alright, which one of you requested an AMA with this attention whore? ARE YOU SERIOUS?! maza aaega. rakhi sawwant of startups. lots of yummy questions to ask this guy #LookingUp to it http://i.imgur.com/NnoGhN1.gif I have a very genuine question for Rahul, hope it doesn't get moderated.

Rahul, what do you smoke ? how much do you pay for it ? and how many times a day do you smoke it ? You got Rahul- oh. Never mind. Awesome, 
this will gonna be awesome, but it will attract a bunch of rubbish media.  Monk who sold his ferrai? Or the monk whose driver refused to drive unless he gave away his ferrari We are so lucky to have few out of those precious ~3L working hours he is left with! After doing all these stunts.. Do you sleep well? How much do you sleep? **Do you even sleep?** Because I have seen you post on facebook early in the morning at 4 A.M. or 5 A.M.... Your situation is like *""Raaton ki neend gai, din ka chain gya.. kya hota hai ye klook[up] klook[up] klook[up]..."" ???* He is in his chappals btw in that verification pic. :D

edit- No offence meant. Calling Deepinder. This one would b an epic AMA ! I think he'll do a U-turn in the last minute, skip the AMA and flip the bird to all of us. Lets do bets...how long before MSN/ Clickbait sites pick this story up & which one will be first...winner get a puppy people get oil and frying pans ready ;). let me leave now to buy a pack of popcorn :) Going to be a nightmare for the Grammar Nazis.

How did you feel when you realised for the first time that you've only ~3L hours left?  Bhai, IST bole to stretchable time hai kya? 6 to baj gaye! Has the AMA started? How do we use this reddit AMA firstly? Hi Rahul, many thanks for doing this AMA.

My question : **What are the 3 most important things that contribute towards a startups' success in the Indian startup ecosystem?** 

Please be as candid as possible.

 Its happening here guys - http://ss.reddit.com/r/india/comments/36hezf/hi_im_rahul_yadav_ceo_of_housingcom_ama/ When does this start??
 Tell him to get some lube.  This is going to be fun! *Marks the calendar* *Rubs hands in glee* What about Rahul Baba?  There is a lot of confusion in the ecosystem right now, everyone is there with his/her own opinion on the recent events. It is now time we actually hear one side of the story in first person. I am having my college exams and you know engineers study at last moment still I am gonna attend it. I signed up just for this one AMA. No matter what he says, there's going to be roughly equal number of people who admire him, and those that make fun of him.

Sorta, kinda like AK or NaMo. This is one to watch out for, for sure! He's the Balotelli of startups. ‚ô™ Yeh to hona hi tha ‚ô™ But...but...are we worthy? Remind me to here at 6 pm IST on May 19th. /u/remindmebot I hope he stops behaving like his other namesake in politics. It is a great opportunity to get to know his part of the story. I just joined in reddit to participate in this AMA :)  Who would you say has inspired you the most and why? Do you consider yourself successful? Is there more to housing.com than VC money? GUYS BRING YOUR ALTS WITH THE MOST FUCKED UP USERNAMES I hope this session dosent turn into a ROast  [removed] Let the games begin! Just got a reddit handle for this  This is going to be fun....waiting :D 30 minutes to go. Let's see what unfolds!
 Let's say I were to cruise up to your local bar with my IIT D t-shirt. I sit down at the bar and order an overpriced old monk. I grab the remote from behind the bar and change the channel to Roadies. I strut over to the jukebox and play some Linkin Park and ask your old lady for a dance.

How do you feel about Digital India ? What you would be doing. If you leave Housing.com Where is the ama going on ?! what will be your next kick? r u a salman khan fan?? Did you just kept thinking to get an idea or u just got it one night in dreams?
How do you find people with same level of enthusiasm as you for an idea? Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who has done commendable jobs in their fields. IF your resignation was not a publicity stunt what was the reaction of Mr. Shailenra and other board members over your letter? Hey Rahul,
How you are able to take such big decision in very short time? can we start?
 give some tips on your digital marketing campaigns according to me they are huge i mean you are everywhere on the internet (housing.com) Why you all are **""Die Hard"" Fans of Steve Jobs**? There were other people on this planet who had done commendable jobs in their fields.   Are you planning to open housing office in Seattle?
Just curious because my current home is having water pipe burst...:-) when will you enter into the sf and give a kick to us startups?
lets play a story telling video on the home page instead of static html pages
bull shit?? What does Rahul have to say about the comments comparing him to Arvind Kejriwal? Nice. Say what you want about his behavior, he has been more successful than 99% of the people on r/india. Looking forward to the AMA. This looks like 100% PR stunt... Rahul, are you Rakhi Sawant? don't rediquette tag the AMA  The best thing about this is that he is going to literally Answer Your Anything... Interesting...

Please cite your sources of knowledge or let us know if you are a lawyer, else refrain from posting your views.
[R]eddiquette enforced.",Mogaji," As pointed out by dexbg; there isn't a bifurcation known as political defamation.

Understand that civil and criminal defamation are the same thing in essence;  civil defamation is a concept under tort law; which in India is not codified, meaning there is no Act or written rule for torts but  criminal defamation falls under S 499 of the IPC which is a codified law.

The main difference between Civil & Criminal proceeding for defamation is pertaining to compensation. While the object of Civil action is to adequately compensate the person defamed for the loss of reputation by damages; the object of Criminal prosecution is to punish the offender by way of imprisonment of fine or both.

P.S. No sarcasm, please.",KaranSingh1," Genuine at heart initially, but swayed away by the very same group of people he pledged to fight against, as he had a hesitant lust for power to change things overnight. NaMo - Uniform Civil Code, discussion of article 370 Congress:

There are a few very intelligent leaders unfortunately brainwashed or subjugated by the Gandhi dynasty.

AAP:

Its cadres, if not its high command, genuinely want to change India for the better, but don't understand that the way the AAP goes about doing it is not the right way. Congress: Has the most experience at governing the country, boasts of some highly qualified politicians. May be also most acceptable party right now. In case of BJP, people are either on an extreme yes or an extreme no. Congress, on the other hand, does not face such devoted and extreme hatred for whatever reason.

AAP: basic idea of such a party is great, some really passionate people have joined the party with true intentions. Whether they'll be heard or not is a different matter I think Rahul is good at heart. Not the brightest, but a nice chap. If he was a normal dude in my circle, we'd probably hang out and have beers on weekends. He'll also amuse us friends with his space analogies.

> * People like Bhagwati believe we should concentrate on  economic growth and the poor will ultimately be helped; whereas, if you concentrate on other things, growth might suffer and as a result, so will the poor. In that chain of arguments there is a dual process. One is that high growth means more jobs. So if the poor have more jobs, they will have more income. Two, if there‚Äôs growth, the economy expands and taxes go up.

> *  With that money, you can fund anti-poverty programmes. On the face of it, this is a plausible argument. But it doesn‚Äôt always work. For instance, even in the highest growth period in India, **say between 2003-08**, most of the evidence shows that employment didn‚Äôt grow much.

Here is [Livemint's Claim Check](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/fI98V9JE8uOmAhVS0fjhQO/Claim-Check-Narendra-Modi-on-jobs-created-by-NDA-vs-UPA.html) on the topic:

>Claim: The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government created 60 million jobs during its tenure in 1999-2005 as against 2.7 million created during 2004-2009 under the current United Progressive Alliance government.

> Who: Narendra Modi.

> Where: At a rally in Rohini, Delhi.

> Check: Modi is right. Between 1999-2000 and 2004-05, there were 60.7 million new jobs that were created as against 2.76 million new jobs between 2004-05 to 2009-10.

> Source: Institute of Applied Manpower Research, Planning Commission.

This illustrates how ""growth"" and ""development"" are not isolated and dead unlively numbers but on-the-ground impacts. How in the relatively low growth 5y period of NDA rule, they were able to add fucking 57 MILLION more jobs than the UPA in a *high* growth 5y period!

This is also not getting much news coverage.  

This sort of thing is the reason why India and China haven't resolved its border dispute Because India can not resolve it.  

China has resolved All of its Land borders in a 3 decade blitz. Except India and Bhutan(which is also because of India)  

India can't even get to terms with Bangladesh and it took 40 years for India to enter negotiation with a neighbor like Bangladesh in 2011 on the border issue.  

PRC settled those 12 borders and only 2 times got about 50% of original claimed land, rest were all around 5-20%, meaning it gave land concessions on Every deal and it settled because PRC leadership and the other country both had Govts/Leadership which were either totally Authoritarian or partially.  

India has not had a single party majority Govt since 1980's. This is the real reason why talks have not gathered momentum because India can't do anything even if it wanted.  

Indian domestic public, political and legislative system presents great challenges to such a topic.

[R]eddiquette,[R] Bitter reality from Modiland,5,213da5,http://www.tehelka.com/bittter-reality-from-modiland/,8,,gkachru," Couldnt do shit to Modi's image even after 10 years of bombarding with the help of their friends at the center. What will such articles do now?  Thanks to Modi, at least we can still travel in trains without being burned alive by Khangress councilors.  I hope tehelka makes articles like these on congress states like assam, kashmir, andhra etc. Tehelka is useless. As /u/rahulthewall points out, it's transcript of Kejru's speech.
