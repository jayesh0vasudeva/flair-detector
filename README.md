```bash
https://github.com/abhishekchopra0907/Reddit-Flair-Detector
cd Reddit-Flair-Detection/
```

## Project Execution

  1. Open the `Terminal`.
  2. Ensure that `Python3` and `pip` is installed on the system.
  3. Create a `virtualenv` by executing the following command: `virtualenv -p python3 env`.
  4. Activate the `env` virtual environment by executing the follwing command: `source env/bin/activate`.
  5. Enter the cloned repository directory and execute `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
  6. Enter the web app folder using cd Reddit-Flair-Detection/webapp
  7. Now, execute the following command: `python app.py` and it will point to the `localhost` with the port.
  8. Hit the `IP Address` on a web browser and use the application.
  
## Data Aquisition

Note-I have included the data in JSON,CSV and BSON formats in the data folder
I had to collect data pertaining to posts on reddit with different flairs 
there were 11 types of flairs-
  
  1. AMA
  2. AskIndia
  3. Business/Finance
  4. Food
  5. Photography
  6. Non-Political
  7. Policy/Economy
  8. Politics
  9. Sports
  10. Science/Technology
  11. Redditquette
  
All other Flair were either treated as being part of one of these or were completely removed
#### For data aquisition ,2 approaches were used -
  1. Parse through `Top` , `Hot` , `New` of `r/india` on reddit and check if one has already parsed through the post ,if not, then append data of that post of the categories -
  
    * Title
    * Flair 
    * Score
    * ID
    * Comment number 
    * User
    * URL
 forming a list for each post and a list of lists as the whole dataset, convert this list into a DataFrame
  
  2. Parse through `r/india` on reddit going through a specific number of posts with a specific Flair and collect data of categories-
  
    * Title
    * Flair 
    * Comments
    * Score
    * ID
    * Comment number 
    * User
    * URL    
save the same in the form of a list for each post and then repeat the same for all flairs
forming a list of list as the whole dataset convert this list into a DataFrame

#### While preparing the final dataset , approach two was used because it provided me with equal number of data elements from each type of flair unlike the first approach , hence giving better results
 so finally 
 
 * Collected 100 India subreddit data for each of the 11 flairs using `praw` module 
 * The data includes *title, comments, body, url, author, score, id, time-created* and *number of comments*.
 * For **comments**, only top level comments are considered in dataset and no sub-comments are present.
## Flair Classification
I basically had three approaches for the problem -

1. Word2vec+DNN/LSTM followed by a DNN
3. TfIdf+RandomForest/Linear SVM/Logistical Regression

#### The First approach 
  1. The ***title*** is cleaned by removing bad symbols and stopwords using `nltk`.
  2. each title is tokenized as a list of clean words that make it up
  3. then a Pretrained Glove word2vec model is used to assign embedding matrix to each word in every title list
  4. Average of all the word matrix in a list of words of a title is taken and this averaged matrix represents the title now and represents the input
  5. The flair with respect to each title is stored seperately and I oneshot this , this represents the output
    
    1. I trained a DNN on this set of Input and Output with 3 dense layers 
    
    2. I reshaped my Input in order to train a LSTM then trained a LSTM followed by a DNN with 2 dense layers
    on this new reshaped set of input and output
#### The Second approach
  1. The ***title*** is cleaned by removing bad symbols and stopwords using `nltk`.
  2. each title is tokenized as a list of clean words that make it up
  3. all the words of a title are joined to form string which is devoid of stopwords and symbols
  4. The titles are then converted into a `Vector` and `TF-IDF` form.
  5. Then, the following ML algorithms (using `scikit-learn` libraries) are applied on them:
    
    a) Random Forest
    b) Linear Support Vector Machine
    c) Logistic Regression
    
    
 ### Results-

| Machine Learning Algorithm | Test Accuracy           |
| -------------------        |:-----------------------:|
| DNN                        | 0.2100                  |
| LSTM                       | 0.4500                  |
| Linear SVM                 | **0.6231343283582089**  |
| Logistic Regression        | 0.6156716417910447      |
| Random Forest              | 0.5410447761194029      |

As you can see the initial results werent satisfactory with Linear SVM getting the best accuracy and NN based models performing extremely bad
So moving forward I dropped the idea of using NN models as my data set was too small for them to properly function

In order to further increase my accuracy I decided to also process the top comments along with the title of a post 
- so I made a new feature that was a combination of strings of title and comments 
- followed the second approach on the same instead of just using titles 

### Results -

| Machine Learning Algorithm | Test Accuracy           |
| -------------------        |:-----------------------:|
| Linear SVM                 | 0.7798507462686567      |
| Logistic Regression        | 0.7910447761194029      |
| Random Forest              | **0.8022388059701493**  |

As you can see the results were much better now and **randomforest** gave me the best accuracy 
So i pickled the randomforest model and used it further on my webapp
## WebApp
The best model - random forest is deployed as a web app. Check the live demo [here](https://shekapp.herokuapp.com). All the required files can be found [here](https://github.com/abhishekchopra0907/Reddit-Flair-Detector/tree/master/webapp)

## Data Analysis
I performed data analysis on the data that I scraped , but due to some error wasnt able to deploy that as a page on my web app 

**But I have included the code and the result of the same in the [Data analysis folder](https://github.com/abhishekchopra0907/Reddit-Flair-Detector/tree/master/data%20analysis)**
