      " A little over 300,000 years ago we emerged as Modern Humans in Africa. We learnt to make tools, tamed fire, hunt in groups and mine for obsidian to make tools and eventually farming. We left Africa about 200,000 years ago, we started farming, domesticating animals  and started making clay potteries,  we started to harness the power of fire to make pots, utensils, and brick. Then we discovered copper, using the very technology we developed to make pots and brick. Bronze was the next step in this technological progress of controlling fire. Then 3,000 years ago iron was discovered, iron could only be extracted, when humans were able to raise the temperature of fire to above 1900 °C wherein iron started to melt from the ore. With this came the era of technological leap from stronger transport vehicle, ships and communications. Faster connection to the world via roads made using these steal and iron tools. We made great leaps in terms of medicine, physics, maths and chemistry. These technological progress not only made our life better but also extended our life expectancy for 30 years to 60 years on an average. And then about 300 years ago we entered the industrial revolution that gave us mass production, luxury items for everyone and communications ability to talk to people in real time across the globe. In less than a 100 years we went from a globe that relied on telephone and telegraph , steam ship and sailboat, to a globe that now has video calling, the ability to access the repository of all human knowledge literally in the palm of your hand. The modern world we live in is because of people working together to bring technology and social welfare to all. But this evil thing call religion is dead set on taking us humans back to the Stone age. \n",

Religion is evil and it makes all its followers evil by extension. Fuck all religion the scourge of humanity.\n",

      "These articles claim that she was in the midst of taking a “daredevil selfie” when the accident happened. Some even state that the youngsters were careless because they visited the beach despite there being numerous warnings against the same. Not only are these claims uncorroborated, but also they are false and present a version of events which did not take place at all, which only shows the sheer lack of responsibility and ethics displayed by the news channels and media houses concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "The articles claim she fell 300ft from the top of a **lighthouse** after she **slipped** while taking a selfie. When in reality she was never on a lighthouse, and the she never slipped from said lighthouse and she was not taking a selfie on said lighthouse. The newspaper even got the location wrong, it mentions a different beach.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Actual Events:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Pranita, who was a student of National Law University, Jodhpur, was visiting Gokarna with four of her friends. They were at Kumta beach, and were sitting on some rocks which were about 10-15 feet above sea, when due to unexpected high tide, 3 of the youngsters, including the deceased, were flown away by a giant wave. Two of them were brought back to the shore by another wave, but the deceased, whose glasses had come off, continued to struggle as she held on to a rock for support she bravely struggled  and tried to swim for 45 mins. Unfortunately, she lost her grip, and was carried towards the deeper end of the sea by the waves. \n",
      "The friends promptly called the Police as well as the Management of the Hotel they were staying at, and proceeded to seek help from the local residents from a nearby village. However, they could not understand the youngsters’ plea for help, and by the time they did send some help, about forty minutes had already passed and the deceased was out of sight. She was brought back ashore on a boat by some of the local fishermen, and was pronounced dead by the authorities. Her body was taken for post-mortem and was handed over to her relatives afterwards.\n",
      "\n",
      "**She was an amazing person**, extremely intelligent, she was the class topper and represented  India and NLUJ at prestigious events such as Jessup, she was kind and warm hearted. Her batchmates, teachers, seniors and even our Alumni have been rallying on facebook and on twitter, spreading the story of what really happened and contacting government officials (Arun jately among others) to take some action against these newspapers but I doubt they will listen to a hundred students. Her family has been mourning the loss of their great daughter, the last thing they need is her being mocked and laughed at for dying while taking a selfie.\n",
      "\n",
      "All we want is that her family is not harassed by untrue depictions of the event which belittle the huge amount of respect that she has earned through her hardwork. \n",
      "\n",
      "I would request you to please check your facts before publishing such news articles.\n",

Mr. Frank Anthony who has addressed you is a Christian. There are also Sikhs and Parsis here. The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics. This is the difference between India and Pakistan. Whereas Pakistan proclaims herself to be an Islamic State and uses religion as a political factor, we Indians have the freedom to follow whatever religion we may choose, and worship in any way we please. So far as politics is concerned, each of us is as much an Indian as the other. \n",

Sure the Indian society looks down upon you and laughs at you and education isn't encouraged at such \"old age\" by societies standards, but I took the plunge. Here's my backstory - I graduated high school in 2012. Scored a rank of 718 in Wbjee 2013 and took up chemical engineering at Jadavpur University. My father lost his job in 2014 due to mental illness and I had a passion for photography. I started working as a freelancer photographer to meet ends. I couldn't attend classes and by 2015, I had 12 backlogs. I decided to drop out and realised chemical engineering isn't for me. Made some good progress in my photography career. Shot few promotional events with Kareena Kapoor,Ajay Devgan,Govinda,etc. But opportunities became bleaker as I didnt have the money to expand on my equipments and upgrade and hence by 2017 photography was totally a failure. People suggested me to go back and finish my degree. My cousin sponsored my studies and I went back to JU, but I hated chemical engineering. Depression happened and by mid 2018 I had 22 backlogs. I wasnt just simply interested in it. Took the year off to recover from my depression, gave wbjee this year and now I am starting a btech in cse from a tier-3 college. So by the time I graduate I will be 29.\n",
      "I really love front end web development at the moment. So let's see where the future leads me. A lot of you might ask, why I am going for a bachelor's degree, I could have learnt coding and got a job in six months. Honestly, there are no shortcuts in life. I wouldn't want to be a 35/40/50/60 year old who lost his job and is unemployable now just because he doesn't have a bachelor's degree. \n",
      "I have seen a lot of posts here by people who are 24-30 and non graduates and they ask for help. This is for those people, even if society makes u feel like a failure, don't let your mind accept that. Because, u can't change your past, but you can plan and act in the present to build a better future. Dwelling on the past won't change anything. I saw lots of posts from people in their mid 30s to 50s on Facebook job post groups, where they took up a job(without going for a graduation degree) and now at a much older age they are without any job and much options. A smart man learns from his own mistakes, a wise man learns from the mistakes of others. I don't know why our society stigmatises going back to school at an old age, but in USA people graduate even in their 50s. Age is just a number, don't let society come in between your life and your dreams. Failure isn't fatal, Success isn't final. It is the courage to go on that counts. Don't let the past define you. Today is a new day. Start again :)\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "1. Deep packet inspection\n",
      "2. Carrier-grade NAT\n",
      "3. Poorly configured stateful IPv6\n",
      "4. Almost completely locked down router with some non-sequitor options\n",
      "5. Clueless customer service, who just say \"we can't talk about X or Y or Z\" and who often do not even understand the question. If you ask about IPv6 settings, they'll say they can't help you, and then proceed to misinterpret it as a request for a static IP address. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first two are reasons enough to not use this shitty ISP.\n",
      "\n",
      "To explain in more detail:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Every bit of data transmitted on the internet is transmitted as a packet. Think of this packet as a [matryoshka doll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matryoshka_doll). What Jio does is open these dolls to see what the innermost dolls look like. That obliterates your privacy. Jio is using software that is good enough to deny you service even if you use strong encryption. I believe that heuristic analysis and the use of known signatures is a part of the firewall.\n",
      "2. Before the days of IPv4 pool saturation, you would get a public IPv4 address (or even more than one) from your ISP, while your LAN would have a private IP address from a range reserved by the IETF (such as 192.168.x.x or 10.x.x.x). When these addresses became more scarce, ISPs moved to dynamic allocation, so unused addresses in their range would be recycled for other customers to use based on uptime. However, each customer still received a unique public IP address. Eventually, people decided that the principles used on large enterprise LANs could be applied to ISPs as well. On a service with CG-NAT, your public IP address is now shared with many other customers.\n",
      " * This is bad for several reasons, and performance and reliability are two of them. For instance, you could have trouble transmitting UDP packets across two routing tables. On a poorly configured network though, security is an even bigger concern, because you can expose multiple customer subnets to each other. The firewall on their router is a major cause for concern. The default is to allow all connections, rather than only established or related connections, while blocking others.\n",
      "3. IPv6 was introduced with the aim of mitigating the shortage of network addresses, and to also reduce the workload on network infrastructure, by changing the way addresses are assigned. I will not get into too much detail as I am no expert on IPv6 networking and haven't really messed around with it until I got Jio, but I can assure you that they are not following the guidelines or best practices for deploying IPv6.\n",
      " * For instance, WAN is assigned in a stateful manner, with only a /128 address being given to your router. Your LAN is by default configured to be stateless, with a /64 prefix length. However your LAN prefix is not assigned by the ISP, but is instead assigned from a reserved linked-local IPv6 range defined in an outdated RFC. So you literally get none of the benefits of IPv6, and all of the downsides of IPv4, as a NAT is involved in your connection.\n",
      "4. Bridging mode is completely broken. You still need to configure your WAN interface even when you want to bridge the Jio router to your own equipment.\n",
      "5. Jio's customer service is brain-dead retarded, and will simply refuse to help if you want anything more than basic troubleshooting. They also don't have any L2 or higher technicians available on the phone. Also, the best part is that their TSP and ISP divisions are separate, yet they seem to use the same customer care number! God help you if you call from your registered mobile number, because then you will be quickly connected to a human from one department, who will promptly refuse to look at issues involving the other department, and you will completely fail to connect to that particular department. They won't even transfer your call! Also when you use a non-registered number to get around this and provide them your registered mobile number, they have no means of identifying which service tickets belong to which department.\n",
      " * When I raised a complaint with the fiber department, and then called the jiofi department to register a separate complaint, the jiofi team would insist that the ticket was raised for jiofi, and when I raised a ticket with the jiofi team, the fiber team would insist that the ticket was raised for fiber!\n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit that I am still using the JioFi connection, but that is because I paid for a year of service, and that only gets used for things like netflix and amazon prime when I am on the move. It's not ideal, but I'm kinda stuck with that one.\n",

      "Politics  :  Rant: In India everything matters except the real issues.  :  https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/e5rae3/rant_in_india_everything_matters_except_the_real/  :  Have you ever felt that us Indians have this sick tendency to completely ignore the elephant in the room while we whine and get offended about every single thing that is not important? As an Indian international student; after observing the Western European education system, I am shocked to see how radically different it is than our own system. I personally think that it is due to the fact that us Indians are conditioned since we are toddlers to put our unrelenting faith in our \"elders\". The only problem is that many of our so called  \"elders\" are also normal human beings with their own problems and flaws. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I first went abroad, I remember how some of our jealous relatives were taunting my parents about how I will lose all my \"culture\", \"riti-riwaz\" after stepping out the country even though I was only going for a couple of months. I literally had to touch the feet of 10 thousand different people to get a proper dose of ashirwad before finally boarding the plane and literally had a back pain throughout the entire flight. Our parents have panick attacks if you don't say a proper namaste to a random \"aunty\" who you don't give a flying fuck about; you are taught fake history both at home and school where you are force-fed the idea of andh deshbhakti; you get told that countries such as US and UK are only successful because of the Indians scientists and doctors working there, and that you should feel lucky to be born in such a beautiful pure society. I also had narcissist relatives telling me that instead of feeling disenfranchised, I should be happy that at least I was born in a upper cast family. \n",
      "\n",
      "  \n",
      "My point is simple. I really do not mind culture, traditions, riti or riwaz. I think they all have their own place and can add a certain level of beauty to a culture; however, I do believe that they should never supersede real world problems, facts and logic that this country is so deprived of.  \n",
      "\n",
      "This is also where it gets really dark. If you are someone who has ability to think critically or you're someone with a certain level of common sense, living in India can be so overbearing because there is so much focus on symbolism. You don't touch the feet of your relatives? You scoundrel! You come late to a pooja? That's sacrilege! You hang out with non vegetarian friends? Chiee!!  You believe India can be more secular? deshdhrohi! \n",
      "\n",
      "I honestly do not blame Whatsapp or any big media company for the wave of anti-intellectualism in India. It is easy to make fun of these corporations by using words such as \"Whatsapp university\" and \"Facebook pathshala\" but the underlying disgusting mentality that is so pervasive in our society is the root cause of why we are not progressing on a global scale. Whatsapp university is not making us dumb, it is just spreading our omnipresent dumbness in a more effective manner. \n",
      "\n",
      "Many of our parents or relatives get triggered if you don't put a tika on your forehead after a religious ceremony but they spit out pan openly in the streets with complete impunity and disregard for local laws. Another real life example is of a person I know who got into an accident due to open potholes in the monsoon season. Instead of blaming the municipality for this, he believed that it happened to him because he did not brake a coconut after purchasing his vehicle. \n",
      "\n",
      "In schools you they force you to sing absolute bull shit slogans like \"bacche man ke sacche\" when this country has  one of the highest rates of rapes of underage girls, and in many schools in India if you dare to question your teacher, you get harassed and abused mentally, emotionally and physically. \n",
      "\n",
      "You go to a wedding in some parts of the country and it is a common sight to see hungry kids gathering around the tent to look for thrown leftovers by people, while on the other hands the women worry about the colors of their sarees. I do not even understand how these people can digest that food while looking at the eyes of those hungry kids. The more you travel around the world, the more you realize how devoided people of India are of any empathy or compassion towards their fellow citizens! \n",
      "\n",
      "How can this country move forward when it focuses so much on frivolous symbolism and have that level of cultural baggage on its back. And yes! I know! There are other countries that have the same problem; however, I was born in India and it disturbs me that our country does not have its priorities straight, and probably never will!\n",
      "\n",
      "The absolute worst part about all of this is that if you dissent or do not agree with the way the our society works then they point the finger at you and make you feel like as if you are the wrong one! If you refuse to partake in the mass shared delusion and psychosis of the \"cultured\" Indian society, there is something wrong with you as a person!   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I try my best everyday to remain optimistic about our country but whenever I open up the news, whatsapp, twitter; or even listen to my own relatives and friends, I feel utterly nihilistic. I hope things take turns for the better in India but I won't bet my money on it so because when you combine religion, symbolism, politics, and fake superiority complex, then you have an absolute mess and chaos on your hands.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sorry for my prolonged rant but I do believe that if Indian society was a person, it would be diagnosed with a severe case of Narcissistic personality disorder.\n",

      "Unverified  :  I am a doctor working in a COVID-19 screening centre and for the first time in my life, I fucking hate my job  :  https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/fq1nzj/i_am_a_doctor_working_in_a_covid19_screening/  :  I won’t divulge all the details but I am a doctor, currently working in one of the only three government funded COVID-19 screening centres in my state and I hate my job. Ours is a resource limited setting, a poor nation with dirt poor patients. The whole country is in lockdown and people are in frenzy. The cases aren’t that many but they’re increasing fast. Our government has this shitty criteria to decide who gets screened for COVID and who doesn’t. Only the symptomatic people with either a history of travel abroad in past 2 weeks or those with a direct contact with a confirmed case get tested. This criteria is so stringent that out of the hundred people that I see in a day, I hardly send one or two for testing. And I am not even counting the hundreds who are attended at a separate ‘flu clinic’ and don’t even see the face of the screening centre. I don’t know whether the government can’t afford the testing kits or it doesn’t want to reveal the true picture, all I know is that we are sitting on a time bomb. What I hate the most is arguments with patients. They come a long way, facing a lot of hardships just to reach our centre and we are forced to turn them away. Literally every single person I see over a six hour period calls me useless because I won’t test them. They’re frustrated and so am I. My hands are tied by the rules and they just need someone to take it out on, and we keep on being the scapegoats in between. I used to be the kind of person who would reach first to the hospital and would be the last to leave but I hate going to work now, I dread talking to people knowing all I am going to do is let them down. Not to mention the hardships I have to face just to reach the hospital from my place of residence because our government has shut down literally every mode of conveyance. So I walk an hour everyday to work only to be cursed by patients and only to put my own health at risk. Please advise your children to not become a doctor. Atleast not in this country.\n",

That gang was led by Susanta Chowdhury, a criminal under the umbrella of the local politicians. These criminals used to rape every young woman in the small village named Sutiya in West Bengal (2000 to 2002). Sometimes, they went to the house of a villager and raped the women inside the house, often in front of the whole family. They used to keep records of every little girl who became mature enough to rape. People who tried to protest were mercilessly butchered. No reports of rape and murder were allowed to be known to the police or media. \n",

      "After that there was a great media and public outrage which compelled the police to capture the criminals and bring them to justice. There were 33 rape cases and also 12 murder cases registered against them (the actual number of rapes were atleast 5 or 6 times more). The ring leader with his four main gang members were given life sentences. Some of the accused were released due to lack of evidence.\n",
